## Nature News Disparities -- gender + location

This document is a first attempt to analyze the Nature News content to see if there are differences in geographic and gender representation. Currently, this work only looks at a benchmark dataset with 10 articles per year, for the years 2010, 2015, 2020. The benchmark dataset currently consists of 2 files

1.  `benchmark_quote_table_hand_annotated` contains mapping between the speaker and their name and gender
    -   `benchmark_quote_table_raw` is the output from coreNLP which we will compare against
2.  `benchmark_location_table_hand_annotated` contains a mapping between all found (organizations, states, provencces, countries) with a (normalized country name, UN region, and UN sub-region)
    -   `benchmark_location_table_raw` is the output from coreNLP which we will compare against

**All analysis shown below depends on the functions described in `/analyze_benchmark_data/analyze_benchmark_data.R`**

## Quote Analysis

### reading in the quote data

``` r
# get the project directory
proj_dir = here()

# get benchmark (bm) file and read it
bm_quote_file = paste(proj_dir, 
                    "/data/benchmark_data/benchmark_quote_table_hand_annotated.tsv", 
                    sep="")

bm_quote_df = read_benchmark_quote_file(bm_quote_file)
```

Lets look at what the file

``` r
head(bm_quote_df)
```

    ## 3 4641259a.html Stephen Kingsmore        MALE
    ## 4 4641259a.html  Daniel Geschwind        MALE
    ## 5 4641259a.html Stephen Kingsmore        MALE
    ## 6 4641259a.html Stephen Kingsmore        MALE
    ##                                                                                                                                  quote
    ## 1                                                                 one was exposed to the perfect combination of environmental triggers
    ## 2 It isn't just sequence â€” they went from sequence to epigenome to expression. That's what really makes [the study] something special.
    ## 3                                                                         "we really ought to look at sequencing of the brain tissue,"
    ## 4                                                        "What they've done here is create a very nice template for others to follow,"
    ## 5                                                  "Both twins came into the world with the same set of high risks for developing MS,"
    ## 6                                                      "There had to be some trigger that caused one to develop it and the other not,"

Here we get the `file_id`, the true speaker of the quote, their true gender, and the quote in question. Now lets find what we get out of coreNLP, which we will compare against

``` r
# 
raw_quote_file = paste(proj_dir, 
                    "/data/benchmark_data/benchmark_quote_table_raw.tsv", 
                    sep="")

raw_quote_df = read_corenlp_quote_files(raw_quote_file)

head(raw_quote_df)
```

    ## 6                                                                                                                                                                  outgoings are now substantially in excess of income

The main columns of interest are `est_gender` and `est_speaker`, which we will compare between lines that have the same `quote` and `file_id`.

### analyzing quote data

First, lets look at the *benchmark* data, to see if there exist any gender disparity evidence. <img src="benchmark_analysis_files/figure-markdown_github/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

Ok, so we see some signal. Now what does it look like for our estimated gender?

<img src="benchmark_analysis_files/figure-markdown_github/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

Nice, it looks pretty close. Things called `NO_EST` are when a quote was found, but no gender was able to be estimated. Let's take a closer look at the errors <img src="benchmark_analysis_files/figure-markdown_github/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

### analyzing location data

``` r
# get benchmark (bm) file and read it
bm_loc_file = paste(proj_dir, 
                    "/data/benchmark_data/benchmark_location_table_hand_annotated.tsv", 
                    sep="")

bm_loc_df = read_benchmark_location_file(bm_loc_file)

raw_loc_file = paste(proj_dir, 
                    "/data/benchmark_data/benchmark_location_table_hand_annotated.tsv", 
                    sep="")

raw_loc_df = read_corenlp_location_files(raw_loc_file)
```

The location data tries to find an organization, state, province, or country. After this it tries to tag it to a canonically named country, and UN defined regions. Let's take a look.

``` r
head(bm_loc_df)
```

Similar to before we will match columns baed on their names, in `raw_loc_df` it has `est_` columns and in `bm_loc_df` is has matching `true_` columns

Now lets first look at the benchmark data ![](benchmark_analysis_files/figure-markdown_github/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png)![](benchmark_analysis_files/figure-markdown_github/unnamed-chunk-9-2.png)![](benchmark_analysis_files/figure-markdown_github/unnamed-chunk-9-3.png)
