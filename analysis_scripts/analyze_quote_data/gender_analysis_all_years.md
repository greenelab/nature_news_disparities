## Nature News Gender Disparities in Quotes

This document is a working analysis of the quotes extracted from Nature News content to see if there are differences in gender representation. The data we will be working with are the following:

1.  `./data/benchmark_data/benchmark_quote_table_raw.tsv` is the output after scraping a randomly selected set of 10 articles from 2010, 2015, or 2020 (`./nature_news_scraper/run_scrape_benchmark.sh`) then running it through coreNLP with additional processing (`./process_scraped_data/run_process_target_year.sh`)
2.  `./data/scraped_data/quote_table_raw_20*.tsv` are the output after scraping all articles from a year between 2001 2020 (`./nature_news_scraper/run_scrape_benchmark.sh`) then running it through coreNLP with additional processing (`./process_scraped_data/run_process_target_year.sh`)

**All analysis shown below depends on the functions described in `/analysis_scripts/analysis_utils.R`**

## Check Benchmark Consistency

We would like to make sure that our benchmark data is representative of our complete dataset, so let's look at some quote stats to make sure.

### reading in the quote data

First we read in the benchmark data

``` r
# get the project directory, everything is set relative to this
proj_dir = here()

# read in the benchmark quote table
raw_quote_file = paste(proj_dir, 
                    "/data/benchmark_data/benchmark_quote_table_raw.tsv", 
                    sep="")

bm_quote_df = read_corenlp_quote_files(raw_quote_file)

# add the year annotation
year_idx_file = paste(proj_dir, 
                "/data/benchmark_data/coreNLP_input/fileID_year.tsv", 
                sep="")
year_df = data.frame(fread(year_idx_file))
bm_quote_df = merge(year_df, bm_quote_df)


head(bm_quote_df)
```

    ## 1                                                                                               "it is an incredibly important negative"
    ## 2                                                          "What they've done here is create a very nice template for others to follow,"
    ## 3 "It isn't just sequence â€” they went from sequence to epigenome to expression. That's what really makes [the study] something special."
    ## 4                                                    "If we sequenced another dozen twin pairs we could make this much more definitive,"
    ## 5                                                        "There had to be some trigger that caused one to develop it and the other not,"
    ## 6                                                                           "we really ought to look at sequencing of the brain tissue,"

Now we read in the full data for the same years.

``` r
# read in the full year quote table for 2010, 2015, and 2020
full_quote_df = NA
for(curr_year in c(2010, 2015, 2020)){
    quote_file = paste(proj_dir, 
                    "/data/scraped_data/quote_table_raw_", curr_year, ".tsv", 
                    sep="")
    quote_df = read_corenlp_quote_files(quote_file)
    quote_df$year = curr_year

    full_quote_df = rbind(full_quote_df, quote_df)
}
full_quote_df = full_quote_df[-1,]

head(full_quote_df)
```

Now we join the tables together for comparison.

``` r
full_quote_df$is_benchmark = "full_data"
bm_quote_df$is_benchmark = "benchmark"

bm_full_quote_df = rbind(full_quote_df, bm_quote_df)
```

### compare benchmark and non-benchmark data

### compare proportions over all years

Now lets look at all years quote information and plot the trend over time <img src="gender_analysis_all_years_files/figure-markdown_github/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /><img src="gender_analysis_all_years_files/figure-markdown_github/unnamed-chunk-5-2.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />
