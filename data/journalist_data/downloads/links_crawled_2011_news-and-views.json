The opposite situation would be if everyone in the class performed without a designated leader \u2014 an activity known as joint improvisation. In a paper published in  Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , Noy and colleagues investigate which of two such situations is the more effective (L. Noy  et al .  Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA   http://doi.org/hbz ; 2011). Day-to-day examples of joint improvisation include two toddlers playing together. A rather structured example is improvisation in artistic performances (pictured). By the improvisers' own admission, there are 'moments of togetherness' when the level of performance is high but no one knows who is leading. But how does this work? The lack of an experimental paradigm means that this question has not been studied extensively \u2014 at least not for open-ended actions. Noy and colleagues designed an experiment based on the mirror game, a widely used theatrical practice. Specifically, they asked two players each to move a handle along one of two parallel tracks in one dimension. The instruction was: 'Imitate each other, create synchronized and interesting motion, and enjoy playing together.' The nine one-minute rounds in each game were of two types \u2014 leader\u2013follower rounds and joint-improvisation rounds. The authors measured the players' movements with high resolution in time (20 milliseconds) and space (1 millimetre). They investigated the movements of expert players \u2014 artists with more than 10 years of experience in joint improvisation. In the leader\u2013follower rounds, the follower showed jittery motion, which oscillated around the leader's confident movement. By contrast, with no designated leader the players performed better, reaching lower errors in velocity of movement and stopping times. In fact, the players jointly showed confident motion 12% of time, compared with 2% in the leader\u2013follower situation. So, is having a leader really counterproductive? It depends. With novice players, Noy  et al . obtained opposite results: these players performed much better with a designated leader. As moments of togetherness are rare in day-to-day life, having a leader is perhaps beneficial for most of us, at least while we learn a new skill. Reprints and Permissions"},

A new model predicts that one such terrain is currently forming over shallow subsurface water.  See Letter    p.502 On  page 502   of this issue, Schmidt and colleagues 1  posit that Europa, one of the four large satellites of Jupiter, is currently geologically active. This result could profoundly affect the future exploration of Europa, which is consistently NASA's top target for robotic exploration in the outer Solar System 2 , 3 . With an ocean of liquid water roughly twice the volume of Earth's oceans lying beneath an icy crust, Europa is the most obvious place to search for extraterrestrial life 2 , 3 . Although the ultimate goal of exploring Europa is to sample the ocean, the next space mission is focused on gauging the thickness of the frozen carapace that another mission will need to pierce. The overwhelming majority of researchers agree that the ice crust is approximately 20 \u00b1 10 kilometres thick 4 , 5 , 6 ; however, the appearance of an unresolved controversy is maintained by a handful of studies that suggest the crust is only a few kilometres thick 7 , 8 . This debate has remained frozen by the absence of new observational constraints since the demise of the Galileo orbiter in 2003. Schmidt and colleagues 1  shake this impasse by coupling insights from terrestrial glacial processes with refined analyses of the Galileo data. The authors did not discover a place on Earth that mimics the alien conditions of Europa. Instead, they built on a new recognition of the role of brines (salt water) along the margins of the Antarctic ice sheet and improved understanding of the movement of water and ice in response to subglacial volcanic eruptions. Specifically, salt water can flow through fractures in ice, transporting significant volumes of both water and dissolved minerals over large distances. When these brines do eventually freeze, material has been redistributed and the stresses within the ice have been rearranged. Also, an investigation 9  of subglacial eruptions in locations such as Iceland showed that the stresses around a small body of liquid water within a large body of ice serve to keep the liquid confined in a discrete, subsurface, lens-shaped region. Combining these ideas, Schmidt  et al . 1  propose a model for the formation of 'chaos terrain' on Europa. A chaos is a discrete patch of the surface consisting of disrupted crustal blocks that have a superficial resemblance to icebergs calving into the sea. The model relies on a plume of warm, convecting, pure ice bringing heat up to a layer of salty ice that has a lower melting temperature. When this salty ice melts, there is a reduction in its volume and the surface collapses. The resulting fractures are filled with brine that eventually freezes and expands, uplifting the matrix between large collapsed crustal blocks. This model fits the available observations better than previous models. Most interestingly, it suggests that the chaos at a surface feature on Europa known as Thera Macula, which is about 100 kilometres in diameter, is currently forming over liquid brine existing within a few kilometres of the surface. The authors' suggestion 1  that Europa has internal processes that are active today is important for many different reasons. Although previous studies have shown that the surface of Europa is geologically young, with an average age of around 30 million to 70 million years old 10 , current geological activity has not been detected 11 . If active, Europa would be in the exclusive company of Earth, Jupiter's moon Io and Saturn's moon Enceladus. The activity observed on Mars, Saturn's moon Titan and Neptune's moon Triton seems to be driven by solar energy rather than internal heat. Furthermore, Schmidt and colleagues' study provides an important target for future missions to Europa. If their model is correct, Thera Macula should have changed markedly in the decades between Galileo and the next mission to Europa. Such changes would mark a location that has a pocket of water at a depth that is much more accessible than the underlying main ocean. As a final note, this study could well be a blueprint for how breakthroughs in planetary science will continue even in a period of fiscal austerity and fewer new data. There is still much to be done to extract information from older data and then convert that into scientific understanding. For example, the addition of topographic information to two-dimensional surface images and the spectroscopic identification of minerals have often proved invaluable in choosing between different models for subsurface processes. However, because the derivation of topography and mineralogy from the available data is still complex and time-consuming, a vast treasure trove has yet to be mined. Similarly, the days of making discoveries by simply visually comparing features on Earth with extraterrestrial ones are probably drawing to a close. Instead, as in this study, it will be essential to understand fundamental processes on Earth and then extrapolate to how these processes interact in an alien setting. Thus, in many ways, Schmidt and colleagues' work could well be illuminating the path for future exploration of not just Europa but the wider Solar System.

The positive pressure exceeds the negative pressure considerably. It often exceeds the plant's needs ... The distal part of a cut root of a fruited banana plant was seen to develop pressure.

The demonstration of single-electron transfer between two distant quantum dots brings this technology a step closer.  See Letters    p.435  &  p.439 The realization of electronic machines that exploit the laws of quantum mechanics is a dream for many physicists. Among the different architectures proposed so far for meeting this goal, one very promising option is based on quantum dots: nanometre-sized electron boxes, or conducting islands, that can comprise as little as one electron. As with classical electronic devices, the construction of such a quantum machine requires 'wires' to connect up the elements of the machine's internal electronic circuitry. But in the quantum world, making such wires is not a trivial matter. Two papers in this issue, one by Hermelin  et al . 1  ( page 435 ) and the other by McNeil  et al . 2  ( page 439 ), demonstrate wires, or 'buses', that can carry only a single electron and interconnect two distant quantum dots. These findings provide a building block for the implementation of large-scale networks of quantum dots, which will be necessary to scale-up techniques for local quantum manipulation that are currently performed only at the single-quantum-dot level 3 . In quantum dots, confinement can be such that the characteristic charging energy of the dot \u2014 the energy it takes to add an extra electron to it \u2014 exceeds thermal fluctuations at cryogenic temperatures. In such a situation, known as a Coulomb blockade, electrons passing through the quantum dot have to do so one by one. This fact, combined with the discreteness of the quantum dot's energy spectrum, makes the dots ideal sources of single electrons 4 . The usual way to extract a single electron from a quantum dot is to raise the last occupied energy level of the dot to well above the characteristic energy (the Fermi level) of the electronic reservoir to which the dot is coupled. This can be done with the help of an electrostatic 'gate' electrode. In this manner, the electron 'sitting' on the last occupied energy level is forced energetically to 'fall off' into the electronic reservoir; conversely, an electron can be absorbed from the electronic reservoir by lowering a previously unoccupied energy level below the Fermi level. Because an electron emitted in such a way rapidly mixes with other electrons in the electronic reservoir, knowledge of that electron's initial electronic state will be deficient, and any quantum information stored in the electron will be lost. This explains why extracting an electron from a dot and capturing it in another one is far from trivial. To isolate a single electron and implement a single-electron bus, Hermelin  et al . 1  and McNeil  et al . 2  took an alternative approach that involves moving a quantum dot rather than acting directly on its energy levels. The basic idea is to distort the electrostatic potential that traps the dot's electron, using an acoustic wave that propagates across the surface of the device hosting the dot. The acoustic wave, which is induced by a microwave pulse, allowed the authors to expel a single electron from the dot and, subsequently, to transfer it to a receiving dot through an empty channel, in which the electron 'surfs' on the acoustic wave. Hermelin  et al . and McNeil  et al . demonstrated successful single-electron transfer between the dots by detecting coincident emission and capture at both dots. These were detected with devices that are routinely used for charge detection in quantum dots 3 : sensitive electrometers that are placed closed to the dots. The efficiency of the authors' approach 1 , 2  was such that it allowed, for example, McNeil  et al . 2  to reliably transfer single electrons back and forth between the dots over a cumulative distance of about 0.25 millimetres \u2014 nearly a macroscopic distance. Hermelin  et al . went on to show that, after initially loading a dot with two electrons, it is possible to split them apart: one stays in the dot and the other is captured by a receiving dot. These experiments 1 , 2  are particularly relevant with a view to using single-electron buses for retrieving and distributing quantum information stored in quantum dots that are embedded in complex networks. It has been shown 3 , 5  that electronic spin can be manipulated quantum mechanically with ever-increasing fidelity. It is therefore possible to imagine manipulating an information-encoding single spin in one quantum dot, then transporting it to another distant dot in the network. What's more, by using a double quantum dot, one could foresee the creation of an arbitrary two-electron superposition spin state 5  and its transfer between distant quantum dots. This would pave the way for studying quantum entanglement of two electrons in a solid-state environment. All of these exciting possibilities offered by the set-ups of Hermelin  et al . and McNeil  et al . require that single-electron transfers do not degrade quantum information, an aspect that is not addressed in their work. Because new electron-manipulation techniques always come with unexpected dissipation mechanisms, it is not clear whether the electrons can retain their spin state, and so the encoded information, during their travels in the channel. However, recent advances in spin manipulation and control 5 , 6  call for optimism. We should therefore be confident that the demonstrated single-electron bus will go quantum in the not-so-distant future. Correspondence to\n                 Takis Kontos . Reprints and Permissions"},

Compared with other great apes, we are not only better collaborators but also more generous. On  page 328  of this issue, Hamann  et al . explore the connection between these two traits (K. Hamann  et al .  Nature   476 , 328\u2013331; 2011). The age at which humans first show tendencies towards sharing has been investigated extensively. Three-to-five-year-olds seem to divide any windfall resources unfairly, keeping something they have obtained without effort mostly to themselves. After that, however, they become more inclined to share windfalls equally.  Hamann and colleagues wondered whether children would behave differently if the resource had been obtained through joint effort. They studied pairs of 2- and 3-year-old children when, in each case, one child had greater access to the resources (to three of four toys) and so could choose whether to share them with their partner. The toys could be obtained in three ways: through the collaborative efforts of both children; freely, with no effort by either; or through independent work. The authors found that 3-year-olds, but not 2-year-olds, in the position of power opted to share more often (approximately 75% of the time) after a collaborative effort than after parallel work (about 25%). So, although the toddlers may not have acquired a sense of 'reward in return for work', they understood that resource distribution should depend on how the resource was obtained. Is this link between collaboration and fairness uniquely human? If other primates don't appreciate the value of collaboration as much as we do, they would be expected to be indifferent to the idea of allocating resources depending on how they were acquired. Testing this hypothesis, Hamann  et al . found that, when in a position of advantage, chimpanzees sometimes shared, but this was independent of whether a food resource was obtained through collaboration or luck. An explanation for this behaviour in chimps may be that, unlike in humans, foraging does not depend on collaboration. In other words, humans appreciate the importance of collaboration for survival and so invest in being included in future collaborative efforts by sharing existing resources. Luckily, we seem to learn this quite early on. Reprints and Permissions"},

This will be good news for those who believe that men are always in the right. ... The experiments ... reported in the  Journal of Genetics , November, 1910, show that \u201cin the rat it is not true that ova determining one sex are produced from one ovary, and those determining the opposite sex from the other, for each rat, with one ovary completely removed, produced young of both sexes.\u201d ...

Such a displacement would certainly change the climate of Northern Europe and Western Siberia, but this change will produce colder winters and hotter summers and will lead to the displacement of the desert belt from the region of North Africa and Central Asia to the north of Europe. \n               From  \n               Nature \n                6 May 1961 \n             \n               100 Years Ago \n             Three letters have recently appeared in  The Times  ... relating to a mysterious heraldic animal known as the \u201cjall\u201d or \u201ceall,\u201d of which the effigy has been recognised in St. George's Chapel, Westminster ... Although described as having horns, tusks, and a short fluffy tail, the jall has been identified with the goat ... In an old document ... the eall is stated to be as large as a horse, with a tail like that of an elephant, goat-like jaws, and horns capable of movement, its colour being black. Other accounts state, however, that it has jaws like a wild boar and cloven hoofs. It may be suggested, if the beast ever had corporeal existence, that the African wart-hog may have formed the original type, that animal having a black hide, cloven hoofs, an elephant-like tail, large tusks, and big face-warts which might perhaps be regarded as elastic horns. \n               From  \n               Nature \n                4 May 1911 \n             Reprints and Permissions"},

A systematic approach to the causes and prevention of hospital infection is much to be welcomed. Accurate records are meagre and the problem is one which belongs to everybody and, consequently, to no one. Since streptococcal infections now cause no real difficulties\u2014they still respond to penicillin and have acquired no resistance to the drug\u2014the book is mainly concerned with the staphylococcal infections which, because of their resistant strains, are the main source of infection and worry in hospitals today... The text is clear and logically presented, and adds to the value of a book which should be useful not only to pathologists and bacteriologists but also to surgeons, paediatricians, sister tutors, hospital administrators, and equally important, hospital architects. \n               From  \n               Nature \n                8 April 1961 \n             \n               100 Years Ago \n             Dr. A.

It includes an account both of the market statistics of plaice landed and of the special scientific investigations and experiments which have been carried out. The market conditions in Denmark are exceptional ... the chief demand is for fish that are landed alive... [As] there is a size limit (25.6 cm.) below which they are not allowed to be landed, and the fish under this size are returned to the sea, the actual destruction of small fish is insignificant. It appears that since the introduction of the size limit the Danish plaice fisheries in the North Sea have increased, and the report speaks in favour of an international size limit for plaice for all countries carrying on fisheries in the North Sea. \n               From  \n               Nature \n                6 April 1911 \n             Reprints and Permissions"},

Only about five per cent of school children contracted a notifiable infectious disease in the years under review. Tuberculosis continued to decline. Poliomyelitis reached its lowest level for thirteen years, and vaccination against it was undertaken vigorously everywhere ... The main cause of death among children is through accident ...

Many years ago he and his father ... noticed a fox come searching along the hedgerows ... they saw that he was collecting the sheep's wool caught on the thorns and brambles. When he had gathered a large bunch he went down to a pool ... and backed slowly brush first into the water, until he was all submerged except his nose and the bunch of wool, which he held in his mouth. He remained thus for a short time, and then let go of the wool, which floated away; then he came out, shook himself, and ran off. Much astonished at this strange proceeding, they took a shepherd's crook ... and pulled the wool out. They found that it was full of fleas, which, to save themselves from drowning, had crept up and up the fox's brush and body and head and into the wool, and that thus the wily fox had got rid of them.

It is a striking snapshot of a cluster of galaxies acting as a gravitational lens: the cluster bends light from galaxies lying behind it and 'smears' the light to produce multiple images and giant arcs. As pretty as their effects are, gravitational lenses are giving cosmologists a few headaches. For example, the observed incidence of giant arcs and their distance from the clusters' centres, which marks the size of features called Einstein rings, indicate that these clusters may have a stronger 'lensing' ability than expected in the framework of the currently accepted model of the cosmos. In a paper to appear in  Astronomy & Astrophysics , Meneghetti  et al . describe an analysis that advances our understanding of these systems (M. Meneghetti  et al . Preprint at http://arXiv.org/abs/1103.0044; 2011). The authors compared the lensing ability of a numerically simulated sample of clusters with that of a sample of well-characterized, X-ray-luminous clusters obtained by the MAssive Cluster Survey (MACS). In contrast to earlier studies, their simulations factor in elements known to affect lensing power \u2014 for example, the fact that the lenses are complex three-dimensional structures. They found that the simulated clusters produce 50% fewer arcs than do the observed MACS clusters, and that the median size of Einstein rings differs by 25% between the two samples. These are much smaller discrepancies between theory and observation than previously reported. But as the authors themselves concede, more data are needed to confirm their findings.

By Bertram E. Smythies \u2014 This is a very unusual bird book. The main body of the work (about 460 pages) consists of a detailed systematic account of all the 549 species of birds that have been found in Borneo ... But it is the hundred pages that precede this excellent treatise that put this book in a class apart ... Lord Medway's chapter gives a fascinating account of the cave swiftlets, the saliva-built nests of which are the edible birds' nests of commerce, and which echo-navigate in the darkness of the caves where millions congregate to breed. [Mr. Tom] Harrison remarks that Governments \u201cby some complicated zoo-geology, claim the guano as a mineral and allow extraction (for fertilizer) under licence. Thus what comes out of the swiftlets' mouth as spit is succinctly dissociated from what comes out of the other end\u201d. \n               From  \n               Nature \n                4 March 1961 \n             \n               100 Years Ago \n             In the Prussian Diet of February 18, Prof. Kirchner ... is reported to have said that, during the last few weeks, three cases of plague had occurred in London, the infection being conveyed by ship-rats. This statement has been officially denied ... With regard to rat infection, three rats which had probably escaped from a ship were examined at the London Docks in November last, and two of them were found to be suffering from plague, but at present there is no evidence of the existence of a plague epizootic among rats in the London Docks area. The destruction of rats ... is still carried out at the London Docks, and careful precautions are being taken to prevent rats in ships from infected ports from escaping ashore, and possibly initiating an epizootic among the shore rats. \n               From  \n               Nature \n                2 March 1911 \n             Reprints and Permissions"},

By Dr. Lal Behari Singh \u2014 It is pleasing, as it is unexpected, to find a new series of books on world crops starting off not with such solid fare as wheat or potatoes or cabbage but with something as exotic and appetizing as the mango. This \u201cchoicest fruit of Hindoosthan\u201d has spread far beyond the bounds of India and has become one of the most cherished fruits of tropical lands. It is still found in greatest variety and excellence in India, and this book comes, fitly enough, from the pen of a distinguished Indian horticulturist. This book may be counted on to commend itself as the most complete study of the mango so far published ... While the botanical chapters refer mainly to the common mango,  M. indica , the author directs attention to fifteen other species of  Mangifera  with edible fruits. Evidently there is great wealth of related material here, of possible value for future breeding ... The section on utilization is necessarily brief, since the best way to use a mango is still to eat it as promptly and as dexterously as possible, but some mango recipes are also given ... This book deserves to be welcomed and to be gratefully added to the small, but growing, collection of hand-books on the tropical crops. \n               From  \n               Nature \n                11 March 1961 \n             \n               100 Years Ago \n             Can any correspondent of  Nature  recall a case of a cat playing with a shadow?

Ruxton"}], "parsed_as_year": "2006_or_before", "body": "Different groups of diving vertebrates vary greatly in size, with whales being by far the largest. A comparative investigation of the links between swimming speed, size and metabolism provides clues to the reasons. Animals that breathe air but forage under water are highly adapted to the challenges of their extreme lifestyle. The oxygen collected at the surface must be husbanded carefully under water to maximize foraging efficiency. Because the energetic cost of swimming increases rapidly with speed, such divers have long been predicted to ascend and descend at the speed that minimizes the energetic cost (and thus the oxygen burned in aerobic metabolism) for the distance travelled. In a paper in  Journal of Animal Ecology , Watanabe  et al . 1  present the strongest evidence yet in support of such fine-tuned adaptation. Key to their study is the consideration of how we might expect both size and metabolic rate to influence a diver's swimming speed. On the basis of established biomechanical and energetic principles 2 , the authors predicted that larger divers should swim faster (specifically, that swimming speed should increase with mass to the power 0.05). They also predicted that low-metabolism ectotherms (animals, such as turtles, whose temperature is strongly influenced by their environment) should swim more slowly than same-sized, high-metabolism endotherms (which maintain a constant temperature; for example, birds and mammals). Telemetry studies of free-living animals are becoming increasingly common, making it possible for the researchers 1  to assemble dive-speed data for 37 species encompassing mammals, birds and turtles, and ranging in size from a 500-gram rhinoceros auklet ( Cerorhinca monocerata ) to a 90-tonne blue whale ( Balaenoptera musculus ). They found that dive speed does indeed increase with size, and that the mass exponent of the increase (mean 0.09, 95% confidence interval 0.04\u20130.14) provided a good match to their theoretical predictions. They also found that the three turtle species in the data set all had slower swimming speeds than expected on the basis of their mass: just as the authors' theory predicted for ectotherms. Although fish are the oldest and most diverse group of diving organisms, they do not reach the gigantic size attained by some other marine divers. The largest-known extant fish is the 6-metre-long whale shark  (Rhincodon typus ) and the largest extinct fish the 9-metre-long  Leedsichthys 3 . Compare these species with the two groups of whales: baleen and toothed. Among the 15 extant baleen whales, only the pygmy right whale ( Caperea marginata ) is as small as the whale shark, and only this species and the common minke ( Balaenoptera acutorostrata ) are smaller than  Leedsichthys . Among the toothed whales, meanwhile, there are at least five species larger than any extant fish. Turning to extinct marine reptiles 4 , mosasaurs ranged up to 17 m in length, pliosaurs and plesiosaurs were at least 15 m and 20 m, respectively, and ichthyosaurs were perhaps as large as 21 m. From these figures, then, explanation is required for the different maximum sizes of the three groups: ectotherms that draw their oxygen from the water (fish); air-breathing endothermic divers (whales); and air-breathing ectothermic divers, both extant and extinct (turtles and species such as mosasaurs). That explanation might run as follows. First, larger divers can stay submerged for longer because oxygen stores increase more rapidly with size than do metabolic rate or the cost of swimming 5 . Second, as Watanabe  et al . 1  demonstrate, larger divers swim faster. Taken together, these considerations mean that larger breath-holding divers can exploit deeper waters and search for food more efficiently. However, these selection pressures do not act on fish size. The effect of size on swimming speed is less drastic in modern-day turtles, probably because their ectothermic metabolism constrains swimming speed. Thus the prediction is that ectothermic breath- holding divers should still face selection for large size, but that this selection will not be as strong as in endotherms such as whales. In agreement with this prediction, the largest extinct marine reptiles were larger than any fish, but not as large as the biggest whales. This is a thought-provoking study 1 , and there are clear ways in which it could be built upon. Further data on diving ectotherms would be helpful, along with development of the theory to give quantitative predictions for the influence of metabolism. Particularly valuable data would be those that allowed assessment of variation in both resting metabolic rate and dive speed in a given species of turtle across waters of different temperatures (and thus functioning across a range of metabolic rates). Perhaps the least satisfying aspect of the current theory is that it cannot explain the trend in the empirical data for avian divers to swim faster than mammals of the same mass. Watanabe  et al . 1  suggest that their assumption that metabolism does not increase to cope with thermoregulation in water may be more valid for mammals than birds. Expansion of the species available for the comparative analyses would help in evaluating such theories: the largest bird considered was the 25-kg Emperor penguin ( Aptenodytes forsteri ) and the smallest mammal was the 33-kg Antarctic fur seal ( Arctocephalus gazella ). Measurements of small diving mammals, such as otters, might be particularly instructive for comparison with those of same-sized birds. A final puzzle is why gigantic species have not evolved in two groups of extant vertebrate divers (birds and turtles). Perhaps the difference between these and the other vertebrate divers is that birds and turtles must return to land to reproduce, and it is this phase of their existence (in which they lack the buoyancy of water to support much of their weight) that limits their sizes. Clearly, diving animals still pose many fascinating questions. As Watanabe  et al . 1  show, however, modern data-collection technologies, combined with biomechanical modelling and comparative approaches, can bring the answers closer to our reach.

See Article   p.196 'Above C4, breathe no more.' This is the memory aid that reminds medical students that damage to the spinal cord above the fourth cervical vertebra (C4) \u2014 that is, the neck \u2014 can interrupt breathing. Injuries at the cervical level are the most common type of spinal-cord injury and account for more than half of all cases. Individuals who survive such injuries usually need ventilators to breathe, and so face a host of complications to their overall health and quality of life. A study by Alilain  et al . 1  on  page 196  of this issue offers hope that we may one day know how to treat this problem, so that patients with spinal-cord injuries above C4 can breathe on their own. Breathing rate, rhythm and depth are controlled automatically by specialized regions of the brainstem 2  ( Fig. 1a ). The neurons in these regions send their axonal processes down the spinal cord to control the activity of other neurons in the phrenic motor nuclei (PMN) of the cervical spinal cord (C3\u2013C6). The axons of the PMN neurons form the phrenic nerves, which, in turn, innervate the muscles of the diaphragm. Thus, contraction and relaxation of the diaphragm enable rhythmic breathing. When the spinal cord is injured above the C4 level, axons connecting the brainstem to the PMN are damaged, and breathing is disrupted. To make matters worse, axons in the adult spinal cord do not regenerate well, one of the main reasons being the inhibitory environment of the injured spinal cord 3 . Over the years, researchers have invoked many strategies to provide axons with a more supportive environment. These include either removing inhibitory molecules, such as chondroitin sulphate proteoglycans (CSPGs) in the extracellular matrix 4 , or grafting in a piece of peripheral nerve that could serve as a bridge for axonal growth 5 . Combinations of these approaches have yielded encouraging results. For example, after a cervical spinal-cord injury (SCI) in rats, applying a peripheral nerve graft, together with injection of the enzyme chondroitinase ABC (chABC) to degrade CSPGs, allows spinal-cord axons to regenerate through the graft, re-enter the spinal cord and form synaptic connections with neurons on the opposite side of the injury 6 . Alilain  et al . 1  applied a similar treatment strategy to recover respiratory function in rats after SCI. The authors made a partial injury at the C2 level to paralyse the diaphragm on one side of the animals' body ( Fig. 1b ). They then removed a piece of the rats' tibial nerve and grafted one end of it in the injury site at C2 and the other end in a small slit at the C4 level \u2014 near the PMN. Finally, they injected chABC at both ends of the graft, as well as in the PMN area, to degrade CSPGs ( Fig. 1b ). Twelve weeks after injury, the group receiving this treatment had the highest percentage of recovered animals and the best quality of recovery in respiratory function compared with controls. Specifically, in many animals the paralysed half of the diaphragm muscle recovered nearly normal rhythmic electrical activity. Moreover, neurons from breathing centres of the brainstem grew axons into the graft. To demonstrate that recovery was largely due to axons that had regenerated through the graft and not just the rewiring of circuits in the portions of the spinal cord that were uninjured, Alilain  et al . cut the graft; this treatment abolished the regained respiratory function. Intriguingly, when the graft was cut, the residual electrical activity of the paralysed half of the diaphragm muscle was significantly, albeit transiently, increased compared with residual activity after the initial SCI. This suggests that spinal-cord circuits were also rewired to some extent in this experimental setting: descending regenerating axons may have connected with different targets, and denervated neurons may also have found new synaptic partners before regenerating axons could reach them 7 . It is encouraging that, despite the havoc such rewiring could wreak, the system could still adapt to the changes \u2014 perhaps through a type of learning process \u2014 to restore proper firing patterns to the motor neurons innervating the diaphragm. Such adaptability might be a special property of the respiratory circuit: it has long been known 8  that there are latent connections in the respiratory system that can be activated after injury. Alternatively, it may be a common property of all spinal-cord circuits that can be unleashed by the degradation of CSPGs, as well as by extensive rehabilitation. At an axon's target site, such as the PMN, CSPGs are thought to stabilize circuits after development is complete 9 . Degradation of CSPGs after injury may therefore give circuits the flexibility they need to make new connections and adapt to changes. The built-in rehabilitation regimen that the paralysed diaphragm receives \u2014 by virtue of the fact that the animal must continue to breathe if it is to remain alive \u2014 probably also plays a part in shaping the new circuit. In support of this, chABC treatment together with physical rehabilitation promotes recovery of manual dexterity after cervical SCI in rats 10 . Overall, Alilain and colleagues' results 1  suggest that combinatorial strategies that promote both long-distance axon regeneration and local circuit reorganization may be universally useful for enabling functional recovery after SCI. Because not all axons of the central nervous system have the same ability to regrow into permissive grafts 11 , 12 , it may be necessary to use other methods to stimulate axon regeneration 13 . Future studies should investigate how best to facilitate integration of regenerated axons into local circuits and to harness the potential of anatomical plasticity to restore multiple functions after SCI.

But models for assessing seismic and tsunami hazard remain inadequate.  See Letter    p.373 Earthquake science has entered a new era with the development of space-based technologies to measure surface deformation at the boundaries of tectonic plates and large faults. Japan has been at the forefront in implementing these technologies, in particular with the deployment some 15 years ago of a network of continuously recording Global Positioning System (GPS) stations known as GeoNet. Papers analysing the data associated with the devastating Tohoku-Oki earthquake of 11 March 2011 are now appearing. One of these, by Ozawa  et al . 1 , is published on  page 373  of this issue. With a moment magnitude ( M w ) of 9.0, the Tohoku-Oki earthquake ranks among the largest ever recorded. The data collected at the GeoNet stations 1  indicate that it resulted from the sudden slip of a remarkably compact area (400 kilometres long by 200 kilometres wide) of the plate interface where the Pacific plate slides beneath the Okhotsk plate, on which northern Japan lies. The rupture area ( Fig. 1 ) lies off the coastline of Honshu, Japan's biggest island, and extends east nearly all the way to the Japan trench \u2014 hence the particularly devastating tsunami produced by the earthquake. Other new papers 2 , 3  provide further information. A combination 2  of GPS measurements and underwater acoustic sounding shows that the sea bottom in the epicentral area moved seaward by as much as 24 metres and was uplifted by about 3 metres. Therefore, slip along the plate interface at depth must have exceeded the 27-metre peak slip inferred from the GeoNet data 1 ; it may have been even more than 50 metres, as suggested from the joint modelling 3  of the GeoNet data and sea-bottom pressure records of the tsunami waves. For comparison, this is about twice the peak slip determined for the giant earthquakes in Sumatra in 2004 ( M w  9.4) and in Chile in 2010 ( M w  9.0) \u2014 and larger than that estimated for the biggest earthquake ever recorded 4 , the  M w -9.5 event of 1960, which ruptured more than 1,000 km of the plate boundary off the coast of southern Chile. Over the 15 years preceding the 2011 event, the GeoNet data 5  had revealed the slow accumulation of strain across Honshu, with the Pacific plate squeezing and dragging down the eastern edge of Honshu. We know, however, that the coast of Honshu is being uplifted in the long term, so a significant fraction of that 'interseismic' strain \u2014 strain accumulating between earthquakes \u2014 must be compensated by sudden episodes of uplift. The current model holds that interseismic strain on the upper plate is purely elastic, and is 'recovered' during seismic rupture of the plate interface, so that in the long run the upper plate does not deform 6 . This assumption provides a rationale to relate slip on the plate interface to interseismic strain on the upper plate. Where the plate interface is creeping, strain on the upper plate is negligible; but where the plate interface is locked, the upper plate is compressed and dragged down, building up elastic strain until it is released when the locked patches slip. Several earlier studies adopted this assumption 5 , 7 , 8  and found that the measured strain across Honshu required a large, locked patch off the coast of Sendai ( Fig. 1 ). The rupture area of the Tohoku-Oki earthquake coincides quite well with that area 3 . A noteworthy discrepancy, however, is that the rupture reached closer to the Japan trench, where interseismic models suggested there was little locking. The particularly extensive, shallow slip seen in the Tohoku-Oki event could be due either to high preseismic stress left over from previous ruptures of the plate interface that failed to reach the trench, or, as seismological investigations suggest 9 , to specific properties of the plate interface. In any case, the observed slip requires the shallow plate interface to have remained locked, at least partially, in the period before the earthquake. The published interseismic models 5 , 7 , 8  indicated little locking at shallow depth, essentially as a result of built-in methodological assumptions: the shallow portion of the plate interface is actually not well constrained if only onshore data are used 1 . These models may have been misleadingly interpreted as discounting the possibility of extensive shallow slip, which in fact occurred. Therefore, in the absence of direct constraints from sea-bottom geodesy, it may be preferable for models to assume maximum locking of the shallow zone of the plate interface. In fact, the interseismic data do not exclude a locked region off the coast of Sendai extending all the way to the shallow plate-boundary zone at the trench. Such an assumption raises questions for assessing the frequency of Tohoku-Oki-like earthquakes. The estimated slip along the plate boundary off the coast of northern Honshu \u2014 due to earthquakes over the past few centuries \u2014 falls well short of balancing the slip deficit that should have accumulated over that period owing to interseismic locking. So it might seem that a large earthquake there was overdue. Indeed, according to the published interseismic models, interseismic strain builds up really fast on that boundary: it should take only a few centuries to accumulate enough strain to generate an  M w -9.0 earthquake. Such large events should recur even more often if locking of the shallow portion of the plate interface is assumed in the modelling of interseismic strain. By contrast, on the basis of historical and palaeo-tsunami records 10 , large earthquakes would be predicted to return only once every 1,000 years, or even less frequently. The way out of this conundrum is not clear. There is no evidence for particularly frequent episodes of large aseismic slip in that area, and postseismic afterslip, although significant 1 , is much too small to balance the slip budget. So either the slip deficit accumulating in the interseismic period is overestimated (which might happen if, for example, a fraction of interseismic strain is not recoverable), or it is incorrect to assume that geodetic rates measured over a decade or so are representative of strain build-up over periods of centuries to millennia. Another paradoxical and possibly related observation is that the Tohoku-Oki earthquake induced more than 1 metre of systematic coastal subsidence, whereas uplift would have been expected to balance the subsidence rate of 5 millimetres per year during the interseismic period. The long-term coastal uplift requires deformation events that are large and frequent enough to compensate for that subsidence. This might call for a review of both the assumption that interseismic deformation of the upper plate is purely elastic, and the corollary that interseismic elastic strain is relaxed only by earthquakes that occur along the plate interface. Finally, the geodetic data acquired both before 5 , 7 , 8  and after 1  the Tohoku-Oki earthquake suggest that the plate interface south of the rupture area is mostly creeping aseismically. There is thus no indication of a major zone of strain build-up on that portion of the plate boundary that might threaten Tokyo. But it is clear that although geodetic networks are invaluable instruments for observing strain accumulation and seismic release at plate boundaries and major faults, we don't yet have an adequate theory to use these data for earthquake and tsunami hazard assessment.

The deflection of the microbarograph took place at 9.42  G.M.T.  with an amplitude of about  \u00b1  1 mb ... On October 31, the microbarograph again showed two very distinct and strong deflexions, namely, at 18.32 and 21.38  G.M.T.  These deflexions are interpreted as being caused by round-the-world waves due to the same nuclear explosion, one being propagated in the backward, the other in the forward, direction. The mean velocity deduced from these round-the-world waves is 311 m./sec ... The waves are supposed to have been guided in the spherical shell between the ground and the stratopause. \n               From  \n               Nature \n                23 December 1961 \n             \n               100 Years Ago \n             The Rubber-Planter's Notebook .
