It was an imperative that was supposed to transcend party politics. The America COMPETES Act, put forth by congressional Republicans and Democrats and signed into law by President Bush in August, was meant to signal support for boosting basic science in the name of remaining competitive internationally. But in a mammoth $555-billion spending bill passed by Congress on 19 December, funding for basic science took a beating. Gone are plans to double funding at the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the Office of Science of the Department of Energy (DOE). \"It?s dead in this budget,\" says Samuel Rankin, Washington DC office director for the American Mathematical Society and chair of the Coalition for National Science Funding. \"Hopefully we can resurrect that feeling again next year.\" The spending bill marks the end of the annual budget wrangling in Congress (see  Nature 449, 962; 2007 ). It includes spending for all government departments other than defence, which has already been approved. The final numbers for fiscal year 2008 include what amounts to a 0.5% increase for the National Institutes of Health (NIH), less than one-sixth of the rise that Congress had sought in an earlier, unsuccessful bill. Within the physical sciences, programmes in high-energy physics and fusion are hit particularly hard. \"This is probably the worst budget for science that anyone can remember,\" says Michael Lubell, a spokesman at the American Physical Society in Washington DC. \"It absolutely devastates and probably wipes out American high-energy physics.\" Democrats blame veto threats from the Bush administration, which forced a last-minute showdown over the size of spending on domestic programmes such as science. The Republican version of the story is that Congress could have kept the domestic priorities if it hadn?t been for thousands of special ?earmarked? projects worth billions of additional dollars. One Democratic priority, energy research, fared relatively well; Congress ignored a flat presidential request and instead boosted research and development (R&D) money for renewables, energy efficiency and nuclear energy by 30%, to nearly $1.3 billion, according to an analysis by budget expert Kei Koizumi at the American Association for the Advancement of Science. The bill also boosts funding for clean coal and other fossil-fuel R&D activities by 13%, to $557 million. Overall funding for nuclear-energy programmes increased, although the president?s request for the Global Nuclear Energy Partnership, to hasten work on reprocessing nuclear waste, was cut by more than half, to $181 million.  The DOE Office of Science took bigger hits. Although its total science budget grew 4.6% to $4 billion, most of those increases were for supercomputers and biological research. Congress withheld money for the energy department?s $160-million commitment to ITER, the international fusion reactor in France, and slashed funding for the International Linear Collider (ILC), the next-generation particle accelerator, from $60 million to $15 million.  Most of the ILC money would have gone to Fermilab in Batavia, Illinois. The lab also saw its NO?A neutrino experiment programme eliminated. Fermilab?s director, Pier Oddone, told his staff to expect 200 lay-offs in the spring (from a 1,900-person workforce), along with mandatory unpaid leave for remaining employees. The lab may even temporarily shut down its Tevatron accelerator. Elsewhere within the energy department, at the National Nuclear Security Administration, money was found for non-proliferation and verification, which saw a 43% increase to $387 million, at the expense of designing and maintaining nuclear weapons. The Reliable Replacement Warhead programme, to develop a new generation of nuclear weapons (see  Nature 442, 18?21; 2006 ), was cut completely. The National Science Foundation saw its R&D funding grow 1%, to $4.5 billion ? not the 8% rise requested by Bush.  At the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, R&D funding rose 7.6%, to $573 million. At the National Institute of Standards and Technology, total R&D funding rose nearly 5% to $514 million, but within that the agency?s main research programme drops 0.8% from $372 million in the previous year. NASA saw a 5.7% increase in its overall R&D budget, to $12.5 billion. But much of that money is tied to completion of the International Space Station and for rockets to return astronauts to the Moon. Within the $5.5-billion science directorate, Earth sciences received the biggest boost ? of 4.4%, to $1.5 billion ? while planetary science suffered the most, with a 1.4% cut, to $1.4 billion. The NIH, which had been set to receive a 3.1% boost in a budget bill vetoed by Bush in November (see  Nature 450, 470; 2007 ), will instead get a 0.5% increase of $133 million, bringing its effective budget to $28.9 billion. That will make 2008 the fifth consecutive year of effectively flat funding for the NIH. The 0.5% increase drew sharp rebukes from advocates for biomedical research, who criticized Bush for forcing Congress to shave more than half-a-billion dollars from what it had allotted to the NIH in November. \"That was a really big hit,\" says David Moore, senior associate vice-president at the Association of American Medical Colleges in Washington DC. \"We?re extremely disappointed,\" adds Jon Retzlaff, the senior lobbyist at the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology. Still, some corners of the NIH will have reason to celebrate, such as the once-embattled National Children?s Study, which Bush had tried to eliminate but which ended up growing by $42 million, to $111 million. Open-access advocates also applauded a provision in the bill that will require NIH-funded investigators to submit ? or have submitted for them ? their peer-reviewed manuscripts to the National Library of Medicine?s PubMed Central when they are accepted for publication. The manuscripts will be made publicly available no later than 12 months after publication.  Meanwhile, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (Democrat, California) sent out a letter to the research community, saying that \"her commitment to the innovation agenda remains strong and steadfast\". And advocates of the physical sciences vowed to keep fighting. Charles Vest, president of the National Academy of Engineering, says that other countries are proceeding apace with research investments. \"If we keep doing business as usual,\" he says, \"we?re going to get our lunch eaten.\"\n Additional reporting by Meredith Wadman and Jeff Tollefson \n                     Congressional spending bills for FY2008 \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

What will 2008 bring? Cheesy chips, perhaps, seeing as 2008 is officially the United Nation?s International Year of the Potato, and, at least in Greece, the Year of Feta.  The UN has also declared 2008 to be the International Year of Sanitation, the International Year of Planet Earth (which lasts for 3 years) and the International Year of Languages. To get the UN to back a year of something takes a good deal of work and time. According to the UN?s procedure for the proclamation of international years, the subject for any such year must, among other things, be \"of priority concern to all or the majority of countries\" and it should \"involve action at the international and national levels\". In addition, \"each international year should have objectives that are likely to lead to identifiable and practicable results\".  The International Year of the Potato was suggested by Peru?s government at the Conference of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations in November 2005. Their support was thrown behind this crop not because it is in any sort of danger, but rather to highlight its usefulness as a resource. As the UN resolution states, the potato could have a role in alleviating world poverty. The potato, they claim, \"produces more nutritious food more quickly, on less land, and in harsher climates than any other major crop\". The official year for the UN?s International Year of Planet Earth is 2008, but funding for it began in 2007 and will last until 2009. The aim of the year is to bring Earth scientists and their work more exposure, citing the 2004 Asian Tsunami as an example where more attention to Earth sciences in advance of the disaster might have meant fewer deaths. The sanitation year was set up to raise awareness of the plight of some 41% of the world's population ? at least 2.6 billion people ? who don't have access to basic sanitation. One of the UN's Millennium Development Goals is to slice this number in half by 2015.  \n              Easy being green \n            Outside the UN, declaring something to be the year of anything is pretty easy ? it simply takes a decision from within, and some organizations prefer this approach (see Box). Aside from the UN?s four top picks, 2008 is also the Year of the Frog. ?Largely our campaign is targeted at the zoo community,? says Kevin Zippel, program director for Amphibian Ark, the international conservation organization behind this year. Because of this target audience, the perceived wider reach of the UN was unnecessary for their campaign. Amphibian Ark has highlighted 500 frog species threatened with extinction. The year of the frog campaign is aiming to raise $50 million to try to save them ? a huge job. ?We have pretty lofty goals,? says Zippel, adding that the year will be a success even if just one of those 500 species is saved. Zippel thinks the wider populous isn?t so blinkered that it only sees UN-backed campaigns as credible. Celebrity helps raise profiles, he says, and The Year of the Frog has Sir David Attenborough as its patron. The campaign also has Kermit the Frog's backing, he says.  \n              From ocean floors to the stars \n            The International Coral Reef Initiative has announced that 2008 will be their second International Year of the Reef (IYOR). But they, too, are going ahead without UN endorsement. ?It?s non-formal and we want to leave it this way,? says Francis Staub, IYOR coordinator, who is based in Bethesda, Maryland. ?We are not interested in being an official UN year.? The reef year aims to raise awareness of coral reefs, and their importance in the world?s ecosystems. By keeping the year unaffiliated, those countries involved are free to coordinate whatever activities they like, says Staub. Other self-proclaimed years include Virgin Galactic?s recently mooted, and unofficial, Year of the Spaceship ? which comes as a number of private attempts to commercialize spaceflight are getting closer to reality.  There is also a growing trend to make a year last longer than 12 months. Dolphins, who had their share of attention in 2007, have had their UN-backed year extended into 2008, and International Polar Year, which also began in 2007, will run until March 2009.  Meanwhile, in Greece, 2008 will be a year of campaigning to keep feta cheese Greek; in Australia the year will all be about scouts ? boy scouts, that is ? and also about engineering teams; in Cheshire, England, 2008 is the year of gardens; and the EU has declared 2008 the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue. Looking ahead, in late December 2007, the UN declared 2009 as the International Year of Astronomy. \n                   2007 end of year special \n                 \n                   International Year of the Potato \n                 \n                   International Year of Sanitation \n                 \n                   International Year of Planet Earth \n                 \n                   Year of the Frog \n                 \n                   International Year of the Reef \n                 \n                   Year of the Dolphin \n                 \n                   Australian Year of the Scout \n                 \n                   Year of Engineering Team \n                 \n                   Cheshire Year of Gardens \n                 \n                   European Year of Intercultural Dialogue \n                 \n                   International Year of Astronomy \n                 Reprints and Permissions"},

The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) on Wednesday shot down the state of California?s proposed greenhouse-gas standards for automobile emissions. The decision sets up yet another legal battle over global-warming regulations in the United States.  Nature News  takes a look at what's at stake.  \n              What would California?s standards do?  \n            Under the federal Clean Air Act, California can apply for a waiver from the EPA and set its own air pollution standards, so long as they are at least as stringent as federal law. The regulations in question, which are part of a broader program to address global warming in California, would require automobile manufacturers to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 30% by 2016.  Since California proposed the standards in 2004, some 17 other states have indicated they will follow suit, according to Environmental Defense, an environmental group based in New York. All told, these states account for roughly 45% of automobile sales in the United States each year.  \n              How do these regulations compare with the rest of the world?s?  \n            The European Commission took similar steps this week, proposing greenhouse-gas regulations for vehicles beginning in 2012. The legislation could reduce vehicle emissions by 19% if the proposal is adopted by the European Union.  On average, experts estimate that vehicles in Europe currently travel roughly 50% further on a given gallon of fuel than in the United States, while the Japanese fleet does almost double the distance.  \n              Why did the EPA deny the waiver? \n            Calling climate change a problem for the nation and the globe, EPA administrator Stephen Johnson said that California failed to make a compelling case that it should be allowed to address the problem separately at the state level. The announcement came shortly after President George W. Bush signed into law legislation requiring automobile manufacturers to boost fuel efficiency by 40%, to 35 miles per gallon, by 2020. Because burning less gasoline naturally translates to fewer greenhouse gas emissions, Johnson said the new law provides a national solution to the problem while avoiding ?a confusing patchwork of state rules?. In a letter to California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, Johnson also said the new federal law would be stronger than the state regulations, which he said translate to 33.8 miles per gallon. California officials, however, maintain that their standards are in fact stronger and go into effect sooner than the new federal law; the state is also looking at follow-up regulations that would go into effect after 2016.  \n              Why regulate greenhouse gas emissions in addition to fuel efficiency? \n            Automobile manufacturers, as well as the White House, have described California?s standards as a back-door attempt at setting automobile fuel-efficiency standards, an authority exclusively granted to the US Department of Transportation. But the industry lost this argument in a series of lawsuits stemming back to a Supreme Court decision in April 2007, in which the justices ruled that the EPA ? and by extension California ? has clear authority under the Clean Air Act to regulate greenhouse-gas emissions from vehicles.  Although fuel efficiency generally correlates with greenhouse-gas emissions, advocates say California has taken a more comprehensive approach to combating pollution, an approach that could lay the groundwork for a similar program at the national level.  \n              What happens next?  \n            The question now heads back to the courts. California attorney general Edmund Brown called the EPA?s decision ?completely absurd? and promised to follow up with a lawsuit. Democrats in Congress might well decide to look into the matter as well, given reports that Johnson ignored staff recommendations to approve the waiver. Meanwhile, the EPA announced plans earlier this year to look at greenhouse gas regulations in response to the Supreme Court ruling. It is unclear how the newly enacted law might play into that process. \n                   California EPA proposal \n                 \n                   US EPA announcement \n                 \n                   European Commission proposal \n                 Reprints and Permissions"},

As the year of Carl Linnaeus's 300th birthday draws to a close, researchers in Northern Ireland have for the first time sequenced the DNA of a specimen gathered by the 'father of taxonomy' himself ? and used it to solve an algal enigma. In 1753, Linnaeus described a type of seaweed commonly called sea lettuce, named it  Ulva lactuca , and put a sample, or 'type specimen', into his herbarium. Today, much of the similar-looking translucent green seaweed found on European shores is given that name. But Christine Maggs, a seaweed expert (phycologist) and taxonomist at the Queen's University Belfast, reckoned that this sea lettuce looked subtly different from the specimen Linnaeus had gathered in 1753. With the help of graduate student Frederic Mineur, she turned to DNA forensics to determine the possible imposter?s true identity. The Linnean Society of London gave them a precious fragment of the original type specimen ? LINN 1275-24 ? from which they extracted the DNA and sequenced the  rbcL  gene, which encodes a protein that is important in photosynthesis and is often used to work out evolutionary, or phylogenetic, relationships between plants. As Maggs suspected, what most scientists know as  Ulva lactuca  is in fact another species. \"The specimens called  Ulva lactuca  over the past 200 years, and all the specimens that were sequenced and had DNA sequences deposited in GenBank, are not the same species as Linnaeus's  Ulva lactuca ,\" says Maggs, who is preparing the work for publication. She thinks that what scientists call  Ulva lactuca  might instead be what was called  Ulva stipitata  by another botanist. But further work needs to be done to clarify matters, she adds.  \n              Dried seaweed \n            \"It's the first time that herbarium material from Linnaeus?s own herbarium at the Linnean Society of London has been sequenced,\" says Charlie Jarvis, a researcher at London's Natural History Museum and the society's curator of plants.  There were fears, says Jarvis, that that the dried type specimen might never reveal its DNA secrets. Not only was it old, but it had been soaked in water in the 1960s for scientists to get a better look at it, and then redried. \"We thought it might not yield usable DNA, so everyone was delighted when this proved not to be the case,\" he says. It's not the first time that Maggs has notched up a success in using DNA to sort out the nomenclatural mess that exists in many seaweed groups. Scientists, it seems, sometimes don't know their  Ulva  from their elbow. In 2003, Maggs and co-workers showed 1  that the genus  Enteromorpha , comprising tubular green algae that look very different to the flat-fronded  Ulva , and which was given its name in 1820, is in fact part of the genus  Ulva , as Linnaeus had said all along.  \n              Sorted out \n            Phycologists are increasingly turning to genetics to sort out algal taxonomy, says Robert Waaland, a seaweed scientist at Washington University. \"Chris Maggs has certainly done a splendid job of integrating molecular phylogenetic analyses with classical and life-history studies,\" he says.  \"It is a technique that can be used to resolve certain nomenclatural questions, provided the taxonomic background is well understood, as was the case here,\" adds Jarvis.  In a related event, Linnaeus?s herbarium itself is moving into the twenty-first century by going online. In November, the society opened a website offering digital images of its 14,300 specimens ? the largest and most important of Linnaeus?s plant collections, which includes 4,000 species from Asia, Europe and the Americas.

Birds that sing in harmonious duets with one another have always been considered monogamous partners, with the singing thought to help in building faithful relationships. Now, research has shown at least that one such species sleeps around.  Lauryn Benedict of the Museum of Vertebrate Zoology at the University of California, Berkeley, studied duetting California towhees ( Pipilo crissalis ). She found that although female birds sang with the same male every day, more than one-quarter of their chicks were not fathered by her ?husband?. ?I?ve never caught a female in the act of cheating, they?re very secretive about their trysts,? says Benedict. But the duetting pairs copulate regularly together, she says. Ornithologists \"perceived the beautiful harmonies of these birds as creating a sense of fidelity, but I suspected we were missing something?, says Daniel Mennill of the University of Windsor in Ontario. It?s uncertain whether the males in the pairs are also cheating, or how they would react if they caught their partner sneaking around. In the reed bunting ( Emberiza schoeniclus ) and a few other bird species, the male feeds the young less often if it suspects the female of cheating, presumably because he knows the kids might not be his, says Benedict.  The extent of the cheating in other duetting birds (including love birds, for example) remains unclear. Most such birds live in tropical forests, where they are hard to access for field studies. It is possible that a more competitive environment may force these birds to be faithful for the sake of survival, says Benedict, but the only way to find out would be to head to the jungle. \n                   Ornithology \n                 Reprints and Permissions"},

A mud volcano that  erupted  in Indonesia in May 2006 showed no sign of stopping at the end of that year, having covered entire villages in mud. At the beginning of 2007,  concrete balls  were dropped into the volcano to stifle its flow. But the mud has stopped only a few times this year, in March and in August, for roughly 30 minutes at a time. Richard Davies, a mud-volcano specialist at Durham University in the United Kingdom, says this was probably due to a temporary blockage when the walls of the conduit collapsed. Current flow rates are some 110,000 cubic metres of mud per day. A network of dams and pumps now tries to deal with the mud. Some 16,000 people in 11 towns have been displaced, and many still live in open-air markets that have been turned into temporary refuges. Factories remain closed and locals have struggled to find new work. Debate continues about what started the mud flow. Adriano Mazzini at the University of Oslo in Norway argues that fracturing and pressure changes following an earthquake in the area resulted in the geyser-like explosion, whereas Davies?s team is 95% certain that oil drilling in the region was the trigger.  \n              Calls to fight cyberwarfare? \n            In April, wave upon wave of computer attacks, emanating from Russia, overwhelmed computer servers in Estonia ? even forcing banks to temporarily shut down online services. That led one of Europe?s tiniest and most tech-savvy countries ? also one of the newest members of NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization) ? to ask what, exactly, is an act of war? Do cyberattacks count? Since then, NATO officials have discussed not only how to best defend against cyberattacks, but also  how cyberwarfare should be defined  That?s a tricky one. ?In cyberspace, it?s harder to assess some factors, like damage,? says Irving Lachow, an information warfare specialist at the National Defense University in Washington DC. A NATO official told attendees at a security conference in October that the policies will be announced at a NATO meeting in Bucharest, Romania, in April 2008. Meanwhile, Estonia continues to push for a new NATO cooperative cyberdefence centre in Tallinn, which it hopes to open next year. The United States, Germany and Spain have agreed to join up.  \n              E8, that amazing mathematical structure? \n           In March, researchers  mapped  a bizarre 248-dimensional object, an entity known in mathematics as E8. The map (which can be very prettily rendered in two dimensions) was touted as being useful to physicists interested in fundamental questions of quantum theory and relativity. Then, in November, E8 surfaced again in reports of something claiming to be  an exceptionally simple theory of everything , which basically involves sticking fundamental particles on various points of E8 and then looking at it in different ways to see how the particles relate to each other. The use of symmetrical structures in this way is fascinating and can be very powerful, and the story got lots of press after  New Scientist  highlighted it ? not only because of the grand claim, but also because its source was a lone surfer with a physics degree. But physicists have since  cast doubt  on whether the idea is really new, really correct, or really able to make testable predictions. We?ll wait for the work to get peer reviewed for a journal, and for those crucial testable predictions to appear, before making a judgement.  \n              The Turkish archaeology site under threat of flooding? \n            Archaeologists are still holding their breath over Allianoi, an ancient Roman health spa in western Turkey that is a well-preserved but not yet fully excavated archaeological site. Early this year, local and international archeologists  protested  against plans to submerge the site under a reservoir created by the 700-metre-long Yortanli Dam, as part of a massive irrigation project along the Ilya River.  Under a barrage of protest from European officials and others, the Turkish authorities have not yet given the green light to close the dam gates and start the flooding. Ahmet Yaras, head of the Allianoi excavation team (which has uncovered 20% of Allianoi, yielding some 10,000 artefacts including ceramics, coins, glass and statues), says the government has indicated that flooding will begin by February. Yaras, who has appealed for a flooding delay of five years to completely excavate the site, thinks that this time the government, under pressure from farmers, will go ahead with the reservoir. ?I feel bad,? Yaras says. ?I feel ashamed for my country.?  \n              The monkey genome? \n            The rhesus macaque is often used as a stand-in for people in medical research, so when its  genome was published  in April, researchers hoped the data would help them study diseases that afflict us. It already has ? largely thanks to microarrays that can tag tens of thousands of macaque genes pulled from the genome sequence. This year, researchers used the macaque microarrays to investigate immunity to  HIV  and  dengue fever , and to confirm that the first-ever  cloned monkey cells  were indeed identical to each other. ?Expression arrays bring the utility of rhesus macaque as the most widely used primate model animal to a new level,? says bioinformatician Aleksandar Milosavljevic of Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, Texas. Meanwhile, genome scientists are using the macaque genome to answer questions like: what genes were gained, lost or copied during primate evolution? And which of these are responsible for the differences among the primate species? These studies are in turn informing further work in people; for instance, the Allen Institute for Brain Science in Seattle is using them to help guide its in-depth study of the human brain. Such work is destined to help explain what makes us human ? though they are unlikely to hit on a firm answer in 2008.  \n              The famous empty dome of Biosphere 2? \n           The historic Biosphere 2 dome in the Arizona desert, built more than 20 years ago for a team attempting to live in confined ecological sustainability, may have finally found a route to real research after years of dead ends. The dome was  saved from the wrecking ball  in June when land around it, northwest of Tucson, was sold for housing. The dome itself was taken over by the University of Arizona in Tucson in July.  Biosphere 2?s new team of ecologists and hydrologists is now preparing to convert the glass-roofed structure for a new study on a much-debated topic: how water is stored in the ground, makes its way to rivers and interacts with ecosystems along the way. A series of workshops is being held ? the next in February ? to plot the research course, says director Travis Huxman. Ground breaking is set for June to create hillside landscapes inside the 1.25-hectare dome. The US$3-million refurbishing project is to be completed for the inception of experiments in the spring of 2009, says Huxman. A foundation gift will fund the work, he added. ?We want to engage the broader ecological community to make this a really transparent facility that anyone can use,? he says.  \n              One father?s quest to sequence his daughter?s DNA? \n            In October, we caught up with a very personal take on personal genomics.  Hugh Rienhoff, a trained clinical geneticist and bioentrepreneur had bought himself a PCR machine and a gel-box so that he could sequence  his daugther?s DNA  in hopes of uncovering the disorder that has left her weak and unable to put on much weight. She turned four earlier this month, and Rienhoff says a friend is now helping with additional studies on her DNA as well as sequencing genes from him and his wife. The website Rienhoff created to chronicle her progress and that of his hypothesis has grown slowly since its launch in July: there are now ten users. ?It?s not the YouTube for genetics,? Rienhoff jokes, ?which I didn?t really expect it to be, to be honest with you.? More probably it will remain a domain for highly motivated parents who have a technical background or access to genomic expertise.  \n              The International Polar Year? \n            The polar research community had a big push with the launch of the International Polar Year (IPY), which threw a spotlight on the poles and made it easier to push for funding across many fields of science. Many, many projects got up and running (see  Scientists kick off huge polar research plan , and the news features in our special issue,  The ends of the Earth ). One cool project has already resulted in an interactive patchwork satellite  image of the Antarctic , which lets you zoom around the ice Google-Earth-style. And it ain?t over yet. As polar research generally happens over a winter or a summer, rather than in between, the IPY was set to run from March to March rather than January to December. And for good measure, this ?year? also lasts 24 months. IPY officially began in March 2007 and goes on till March 2009. So stay tuned for updates. \n                   2007 in review \n                 Reprints and Permissions"},

Can you model what happened in the early Universe in the laboratory? Yes, according to one group of physicists. A team at Lancaster University in the United Kingdom has used liquid helium and a magnetic field to build a finger-sized representation of the early cosmos. Their findings, published today in  Nature Physics 1 , could help string theorists to refine their models. It is thought that shortly after the Big Bang, the nascent Universe underwent a very rapid period of expansion, known as inflation. But theorists are still debating what drove the rapid growth.  A popular theory amongst string theorists is that inflation was caused by the collision of two 'branes'. A brane (derived from the word 'membrane') is a three-dimensional object suspended in a higher-dimensional space, in the same way that a sheet of paper is a two-dimensional object in a three-dimensional space. One idea within string theory is that our entire Universe sits on a single such brane, and that it was our brane?s collision with another that drove inflation. The question is how to test this theory: finding two Universe-sized objects that you can crash into each other might be slightly difficult. But a good analogue can be found in a strange concoction of liquid helium, according to Richard Haley, who led the team at Lancaster University.  \n              Superfluid \n            Haley and his group used an 8mm by 45mm cylinder filled with helium-3, an isotope of helium that contains two protons and a single neutron. When cooled to just 150 microkelvin above absolute zero, helium-3 becomes a superfluid and begins to take on some odd traits: ghostly 'quasi-particles' are formed that can flit effortlessly through the frigid liquid. And the entire system can undergo 'symmetry breaking' ? a phenomenon also thought to have led to the creation of every force we see today except gravity. It also tends to settle into one of two phases, which physicists label A and B.  The team used a magnetic field to create an A-phase slice of helium-3 sandwiched between two sections of B-phase liquid. They then decreased the field and watched as the two B-phases collided. The colliding phases were, believe it or not, good analogues for colliding branes, Haley says. While helium-3 is radically different from the vacuum of space, the maths governing the two systems are similar.  \n              Spot the defects \n            Haley and his team found evidence of defects ? similar to those predicted by brane theory ? left over from the collision.  Normally, quasi-particles can move with no resistance through superfluid helium-3, but have trouble crossing between A and B phases. Haley?s team found the quasi-particles still encountered resistance even after the A-phase was completely removed. The most likely explanation is that their flow was impeded by strange, quantum-mechanical vortices left over from the collision, the team says. Universe-sized brane collisions are thought to leave behind a tangle of defects called 'cosmic strings' ? massive, spaghetti-like objects that would criss-cross the entire cosmos. None have been seen to date, but theorists believe that their gravity waves might one day be detected by specialized instruments. This lab model of brane theory is far from perfect, says Cliff Burgess, a theorist at the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics in Waterloo, Canada. For example, branes on the universal scale move at close to the speed of light and crinkle more easily than helium-3 branes. But nevertheless, he says, the liquid helium-3 analogue could provide some clues about how cosmic defects form and what they might look like. \"Just having these two communities [condensed-matter physicists and string theorists] talking may suggest mechanisms to the theorists,\" Burgess says. Haley says his team will now begin trying to characterize the exact nature of the defects created when their little branes collide. \n                   Brane theory \n                 Reprints and Permissions"},

Insults, threats, tears and booing: the latest round of international climate talks made for an entertaining, if gruelling, two weeks in Nusa Dua, Indonesia. These talks may well be remembered for the bold stand that developing countries took against the United States in the push for consensus on how to move forward in negotiating a new international framework on climate change.  Some 10,000 delegates from nearly 190 nations finally agreed on Saturday to a 'Bali roadmap' that will guide negotiations up until the end of 2009, when they will have to decide on a regime to replace the Kyoto Protocol in 2012. But the path to agreement was rocky from the outset, as discussions over individual words in the draft document led to heated arguments, threats of trade sanctions or boycotts, and even tears.  By the middle of the second week, a deal had more or less been reached on some of the key issues that would enable developing nations ? including those with budding economies ? to reduce their emissions. The deal entailed providing compensation for reducing tropical deforestation, which accounts for some 20% of greenhouse gases. That left two thorny issues on the table, both of which the United States objected to. As one of the world's largest greenhouse-gas emitters and the only rich nation not to have ratified Kyoto, the United States became noticeably isolated as developing and developed nations, led by the European Union (EU), stood strong on the need for richer countries to lead on climate change and to tackle it with emissions targets. In a year that has been punctuated with reports from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) on the urgency of global warming, most delegations agreed that the roadmap should refer to the need for industrialized nations to slash emissions by 25-40% of 1990 levels by 2020.  The EU delegation, headed by commissioner Stavros Dimas, argued that a roadmap without a destination would be pointless. And Portuguese secretary of state for the environment, Humberto Rosa said:\"It is crucial for us that we must have an idea where we are heading to ? it's not only to science to show us the destination, but the destination must be consistent with the science.\"  But the United States countered that to include specific numbers would be to \"prejudge the outcome\" of the process. Following days of intensive negotiations, a compromise was reached by including a footnote reference to the IPCC's fourth assessment report, without mention of the numerical range on reductions. Many feel that this concession amounts to sidelining the science, and risks narrowing the window of opportunity to avert dangerous climate change.    Amid all the drama, the real blows were reserved for a grand finale on Saturday, when worn-out delegates wrangled over one remaining issue ? whether rich nations should provide \"verifiable, measurable and reportable\" technological aid to developing countries. Seemingly inspired by Al Gore's speech on Thursday urging delegates to sidestep the \"obstructionist\" United States, and following much booing and hissing at the US delegation, Kevin Conrad, Papua New Guinea's ambassador for climate change, stated: \"If you cannot lead, leave it to the rest of us. Get out of the way.\" In an eleventh-hour turnaround, the United States conceded. \"Bali has delivered what it needed to do,\" says Yvo de Boer, the executive secretary of the UN convention on climate change, calling the agreement \"ambitious, transparent, and flexible\". Perhaps most importantly, it has succeeded in bringing what may still be the world's largest emitter back to the table. But whether the 'flexibility' that was required will ultimately provide a means of manoeuvring out of real emissions reductions remains to be seen. \n                     UN Climate Change special \n                   \n                     Nature Reports Climate Change \n                   \n                     UNFCCC \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

In January 2006, Woo Suk Hwang?s apparent breakthrough articles announcing the first cloned human embryonic stem cells were shown to be fabrications. It was the biggest scientific scandal in recent history, and one might have thought his scientific career was over. Hwang was fired from his position and his licence to work with human embryonic stem cells was revoked. But on 17 December an official said that Hwang had applied for a new licence for this type of work. The Korean science ministry is expected to make a decision on the application by April 2008. And in the meantime, Hwang?s name has appeared on more than a dozen scientific articles. Most of them, such as a wolf-cloning article, are 'leftovers' from his Seoul National University research group, which he led until the scandal. Although he was fired from that position in March 2006, papers continued to be published on work done when he led the lab. At least three publications, however, have resulted from work after the scandal, from Hwang?s new, privately funded group at the Sooam Biotech Research Foundation on the outskirts of Seoul. The articles, published in  Animal Production Science 1 ,  Reproduction 2 , and  Theriogenology 3 , all discuss improvements in pig cloning by new methods of cultivating porcine eggs. Hwang is the corresponding author on all. Editor-in-chief of  Animal Reproduction Science , Keith Lindsay Macmillan of the University of Melbourne, Australia, says that a reviewer assigned to reading the manuscript raised the issue of Hwang?s involvement. But the reviewer expressed the opinion that the manuscript?s contents did not arouse any issues of concern and that any decision should not be prejudiced by Hwang?s co-authorship. ?One of the Journal?s Board members? was asked to provide an opinion related to the reliability and credibility of the manuscript?s contents,? Macmillan told  Nature . ?The Board member confirmed the opinion of the reviewer. From this point, the manuscript was processed in the normal manner.?

Marine mammals have an uncanny ability to remain awake and alert while holding their breath during long dives. New research shows that this might be thanks to high concentrations of oxygen-binding proteins in the brain. The proteins, called globins, could help these mammals to remain active long after blood oxygen levels sink low enough to cause a human to black out.  Some marine mammals can spend more than 90 minutes under water, altering their physiology to make the most of their limited oxygen supply. Their heartbeats slow down, and blood flow is prioritized to the brain by mobilizing oxygen stores in muscles and constricting blood vessels leading to peripheral tissues. They can also suppress their shivering instinct in cold waters, allowing their body temperature to drop, again conserving oxygen (see  Seals don't shiver in chilly waters ).  These changes are similar to those seen in hibernation, leading some to speculate that diving mammals enter a sort of torpor. But Terrie Williams, a marine-mammal physiologist at the University of California at Santa Cruz, has observed mammals during their dives and knows that they often remain active. \"They?re alert, their eyes are moving around watching you,\" says Williams. \"These are not animals that appear to be asleep or hibernating. They?re on top of their game.\"  \n              Brain oxygen boost \n           Williams decided to look for other physiological changes that could help to account for the marine mammals? resilience. She reasoned that globins could provide an answer. Haemoglobin, a prominent oxygen-carrier found in the blood, is the best known member of the globin family, but researchers have recently uncovered more globins, including two that are found specifically in the brain.  Williams and her colleagues obtained brain samples from the carcasses of 16 mammalian species, ranging from mice to whales. They then tested each sample for its haemoglobin concentration and found that it showed a 9.5-fold range across the species. Marine mammals generally had higher concentrations of this globin and up to three times more of the two neural globins in their brains than terrestrial mammals had.  Overall, the difference was so striking that Williams says she learned to tell a terrestrial animal from a marine mammal just by looking at their brains: the haemoglobin-rich blood of marine mammals stains the brain a darker red (see picture). The results are published this week in  Proceedings of the Royal Society B 1 .  \n              Brains apart \n            The work is an important step towards understanding the abilities of marine mammals, says Andreas Fahlman, a physiologist in Ottawa, Canada who has studied diving animals. Fahlman has also observed sea lions being very active during their long dives. \"Very few people have looked at this,\" he says, mainly because of the logistical difficulties in working with deep-diving animals. Lars Folkow of the University of Troms\u00a3 in Norway has also been studying oxygen deprivation, this time in the North Atlantic hooded seal, which can dive to 1,000 metres and remain submerged for an hour. He and his colleagues have found that in seals, neurons remain active after an hour of hypoxia, whereas in mice, they fall silent after five minutes. Folkow notes that the assays Williams and her colleagues used to measure neural globin concentrations may not be capable of fully weeding out a signal from the much more abundant haemoglobin. Nevertheless, he says that he and his colleagues have also found that globin distribution differs in seal brains compared with mouse brains. Folkow adds that subterranean mole rats, which live in underground tunnels that are sometimes flooded, also have high levels of globin in their brain. All this adds to the evidence that these proteins have some neuroprotective effect, he says. \n                   Terrie Williams' lab \n                 \n                   Proceedings of the Royal Society B \n                 Reprints and Permissions"},

Stimulating just one neuron can be enough to affect learning and behaviour, researchers have found. The results, published this week by  Nature, conflict with the long-held notion that many neurons ? in the order of thousands ? are required to generate a behavioural reaction.  The findings lend support to the ?sparse-coding? hypothesis of neural networks, which suggests that only a few neurons need to fire to generate a response. That theory has been hotly debated, says Karel Svoboda, a neurobiologist at the Janelia Farm research campus at Howard Hughes Medical Institute in Ashburn, Virginia, and one of the study's authors. ?There are lots of fights about whether or not neural codes are sparse,? he says. Svoboda and his colleagues, as well as an independent group of researchers lead by Michael Brecht of the Humboldt University in Berlin, Germany, tackled the debate by studying the region in the rodent brain that receives sensory inputs from the whiskers. That region, called the barrel cortex, is made up of roughly two million neurons. Each whisker transmits signals to a group of cells clustered in the barrel-shaped arrangement that gives the region its name. The size of the barrel cortex reflects its importance; rats can navigate almost as well with their whiskers as with their eyes. Brecht says that when he did experiments with blind and sighted rats, \"You really had to label the cage with the blind rats because they moved so perfectly with their whiskers.?  \n              Light touch \n            Both teams used techniques that allowed them to stimulate specific sets of neurons. Svoboda and his colleagues created transgenic mice that express a light-responsive protein specifically within the region of the barrel cortex associated with learning. The protein, naturally found in algae, responds to blue light by allowing ions to flow through cell membranes, creating an electric current.   Having implanted a glass window into the skulls of their mice, the researchers mounted a tiny light-emitting diode onto the animals' heads. The technique did not allow them to target individual neurons, but the researchers could vary the intensity of the effect on the cell membranes by dialling the intensity of the light up or down.  Svoboda and his colleagues rewarded their mice with a drink of water every time they correctly selected one of two ports in their cages after stimulation. They found that the mice learned to respond to pulses of light that activated as few as sixty neurons 1 . Brecht?s group took a different tact. Working with rats, the researchers implanted electrodes designed to activate single neurons deep within the barrel cortex. They then trained their rats to interrupt a light beam with multiple tongue licks when they sensed the neural stimulation. Using this method, the researchers found that on average, the rats responded to the stimulation of a single neuron 5% of the time 2 . But the extent of that response was highly dependent on which neuron was stimulated. Some neurons could provoke a response nearly 50% of the time. These results could have a radical effect on how neurobiologists view neural networks, says Dirk Feldmeyer, a neurobiologist at J\u00a3lich Research Centre in Germany. ?Increasing the activity by just a minute amount is actually changing the way the cortex perceives sensory stimuli,? he says. ?It?s really changing the view that the cortex is responding to stimuli with massive activity.? But Brecht and Svoboda readily acknowledge that their findings won?t end the sparse-coding debate. ?These experiments show that animals can read out very sparse codes,? says Svoboda. ?But they don?t tell you that coding during normal behaviour is sparse.?  To do so would require extremely sensitive imaging techniques to probe neural activity. ?That?s not yet been done in a satisfying way,? says Svoboda. ?There are technical issues that need to be overcome, but a lot of people are working on that.? \n                   Nature Insight: Plasticity & neuronal computation \n                 \n                   Web Focus: Circuits and innate behaviour \n                 \n                   Neuroscience Gateway \n                 \n                   Nature Neuroscience blog \n                 \n                   Karel Svoboda \n                 \n                   Michael Brecht \n                 Reprints and Permissions"},

NASA's next \"Scout\" mission to Mars will miss its chance to launch in 2011 because of a conflict of interest between one of the two proposing teams and the panel set up to evaluate them, NASA said Friday. The agency has formed a new panel to choose between the two finalists for the $475-million mission, which would be the second in the Scout series that began with the launch of Phoenix in August. But the delay means that NASA will have to move the planned launch to 2013, since Mars launch opportunities occur only every 26 months. In a news conference, Mars exploration program director Doug McCuistion declined to say who or what was involved in the conflict, but said it was a mistake on the part of one of the two proposing teams. \"In the 20-plus years I?ve been in the agency, I haven?t seen this happen before,\" he says. McCuistion noted that the conflict of interest did not involve NASA associate administrator for space science Alan Stern, who was originally the principal investigator for one of the proposed missions before he moving to NASA this year. Jim Burch of the Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio, Texas, is now the primary investigator on that proposal, called the Great Escape. The other project, called Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution (MAVEN), is led by planetary scientist Bruce Jakosky of the University of Colorado at Boulder. Both proposals are orbiters that would investigate the evolution and dynamics of the upper atmosphere of Mars as a way of understanding how the climate shifted from warm and wet to cold and dry. The spacecraft would measure current changes in the Martian atmosphere. Most of the atmosphere disappeared billions of years ago, possibly as the solar wind eroded it.  NASA had wanted to pick a mission by the end of 2007. The two finalists submitted their mission proposals in October, and NASA officials soon discovered the conflict in the evaluation panel, which comprised scientists and engineers from NASA and the research and development community.  Now, each team has until August to revise its proposal for the new launch window. A final decision will come at the end of 2008. By then Phoenix, a lander that will dig into polar ice, should be in operation. Another mission, the Mars Science Laboratory rover, is scheduled for a 2009 launch. Burch describes the missed launch window as \"unfortunate,\" but says the pressures were making it too risky to go ahead. \"It blew a schedule that was pretty tight to begin with.\" \"We?re very upset and disappointed,\" added Jakosky. \"This is not what I was hoping would be announced today.? \n                   Mars Scout missions \n                 \n                   NASA announcement \n                 Reprints and Permissions"},

Researchers have analysed fossils of what seems to be the missing link between whales and land-based mammals. The fossils help to show how cetaceans, including whales, dolphins and porpoises, might have evolved from artiodactyls ? even-toed hoofed mammals ? some 50 million years ago. The teeth hint that the wading creature still preferred terrestrial plants over fish, indicating that it probably took to water to get away from predators rather than in search of food. Hans Thewissen, at Northeastern Ohio Universities College of Medicine in Rootstown, and his colleagues examined fossils of a small, stocky artiodactyl belonging to a group called the raoellids that were found in Kashmir, India. The creature ?  Indohyus  ? looked similar to a mini deer and probably waded in the water like a hippo. That doesn?t sound much like a whale, but  Indohyus  has similarities to whales and other cetaceans that have not been seen before in raoellids or in other artiodactyls. Specifically the fossil hosts a thick covering of bone over the middle-ear space (called the involucrum). Before this, the involucrum had only ever been seen in cetaceans. The findings are published this week in  Nature 1 .  \n              Vegetarian diet \n            Thewissen?s team also looked at the teeth of  Indohyus,  to find out what it ate. There has been debate about whether cetacean teeth had adapted to meat-eating before or after they became aquatic.  The levels of different carbon and oxygen isotopes in the tooth enamel of land-dwelling animals differ from those in aquatic animals because of the different isotope compositions in the food and water that they ingest.  Indohyus?s  teeth have higher levels of the carbon-13 isotope than is typical for water-foraging whales from the Eocene, suggesting that it fed on land-based plants instead. \"We'd like to know in more detail what it ate,\" says Thewissen. \"Isotopes found in the teeth indicate that it was not submerged vegetation. We'll be studying that in the future.\" Another clue as to how  Indohyus  lived can be found in its limb bones, which were thickened and heavy in the same way that a hippo?s are. This suggests the animal was a wader, with heavy bones to help stop it from floating.  \n              Safety in the water \n            Based on this evidence, Thewissen suggests that the ancestors of whales took to the water as a predator-avoidance mechanism, and didn't develop specific aquatic feeding behaviour until much later. Palaeontologist Jonathan Geisler, from Georgia Southern University in Statesboro, had previously identified a link between raoellids and whales, but his evidence was based only on small fragments of teeth. This new work solidifies the link, he says.  \"What is really important about these fossils is that they seem to confirm the hypothesis that the ancestor of cetaceans became semi-aquatic before evolving teeth specialized for eating fish,\" says Geisler. \n                   Video interview on whale evolution \n                 \n                   Hans Thewissen's research \n                 Reprints and Permissions"},

Researchers have reversed almost all symptoms of fragile-X syndrome in a mouse model for the disease. In humans, fragile X is the most common form of heritable mental retardation and one of the leading known causes of autism.  The findings, published today in  Neuron 1 , add to evidence suggesting a cause of fragile X defects ? with possible therapeutic implications. ?I think it?s an exciting set of findings that indicates a clear route to attempt treatment for a significant set of fragile-X symptoms,? says Thomas Jongens, a neurogeneticist at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine in Philadelphia, who was not involved in the research.  Male mice have only one copy of the gene that encodes the fragile-X mutant related protein FMRP, which is ? as its name suggests ? mutated in the disease. When this gene is knocked out, the males produce a useful, if imperfect, model for the human disease. A team led by Mark Bear, director of the Picower Institute for Learning and Memory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, crossed these mice with other mice lacking a copy of a specific receptor protein called mGluR5. Earlier work had suggested that overproduction of mGluR5 could be responsible for fragile X defects.  \n              Symptom free \n            The offspring of these crossed mice did not suffer from symptoms, which can include seizures, altered neuronal physiology, and a kind of exaggerated forgetfulness of some learned behaviour. Other researchers praised the study. ?People have had a hell of a time getting behavioural phenotypes from fragile-X mice,\" says Justin Fallon, who researches fragile X at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island. \"This has been a stumbling block for the field.\" Scientists have been hoping for advances for some time. In 2002, Bear and his colleagues proposed that FMRP might put a brake on the activation of mGluR 2 . Over the years the theory has stood up to testing in models for the disease, including in fruit-fly studies by Jongens that showed the disease could be reversed in flies with drugs that block mGluR activation 3 . The current study, by using genetics to correct the defects, provides a clear indication that mGluR5 is the right target.  \n              Clinical trials \n            \"This is a directly translatable result,\" says Bear, who has founded a company, Seaside Therapeutics in Cambridge, Massachusetts, that is focused on bringing glutamate-blocking drugs to clinical trials. He also says he sees potential for treating some forms of autism. Only a small percentage of people with autism have the fragile-X mutation, but many people with fragile X satisfy the diagnostic criteria for autism. ?I?d be extremely pleased if all we accomplished was correcting fragile X in humans,\" says Bear. \"But we think and it?s possible that this work on fragile X could extend into autism in general.?  Still, challenges remain. Bear says that Seaside Therapeutics has applied to the US Food and Drug Administration to test a compound, one of several mGluR antagonists licenced from Merck, in adult humans. If approved, drug trials could start as early as next year ? but this class of drugs has traditionally produced mixed results and no compounds are currently approved for any condition.  Still, Bear is hopeful that the major obstacles have been overcome. ?We have a lot of question marks that still face us,\" he says. \"I think that at the very least we?ve established a great target.? \n                   National Fragile X Foundation \n                 \n                   The Bear Lab \n                 Reprints and Permissions"},

A mathematical competition between two rhesus macaques and fourteen undergraduates has revealed a new similarity between monkeys and college students: their ability to handle basic addition.  In the battle of man versus macaque, students bested the monkeys for overall accuracy at 94% to 76%. But response times during a computerized test of addition were approximately the same in the two groups. Both groups were more likely to stumble as the magnitude of the sums increased.  Such similarities, researchers say, suggest an evolutionary continuity between basic mathematical skills in humans and other primates. The results are published this week in  PLoS Biology 1 .  The fact that monkeys can handle basic arithmetic is not in itself new, as it had been suggested by previous work. If monkeys watch as lemons are placed behind a screen, for example, they will stare longer at the fruit if the screen is lifted to reveal an incorrect sum of lemons 2 . Their apparent surprise when the number of lemons revealed isn't what was expected suggests the presence of rudimentary mathematical ability, says Jessica Cantlon of Duke University in Durham, North Carolina. \"It?s not math in the sense of a symbolic procedure, the way that humans typically think of math,\" says Cantlon. Monkeys won't be doing full-blown algebra anytime soon. \"It?s a more primitive form.\"  \n              Dotty \n            Cantlon and her colleague, neuroscientist Elizabeth Brannon, tested the extent of these abilities by training monkeys to watch as two groups of dots were displayed briefly on a computer screen. Subjects were then presented with two new sets of dots and asked to select the one that represented the correct sum of the previous set ( see video ). The task didn't get too hard: the highest sums were always less than 20. The dots were flashed onto the computer screen for only half a second ? too quick for humans to use their verbal skills to count them. \"If you make them respond really rapidly, they don?t have enough time to perform some sort of verbal counting algorithm,\" says Cantlon. \"If you really push the system, you can get a performance out of it that?s much more primitive.\" Cantlon and Brannon also varied the size and position of the dots, so that study participants could not use estimates of surface area or pattern recognition to help in choosing the correct sum. The monkeys were rewarded for correct answers with a drink of Kool-Aid; college students received $10 for participating in the study. Students had a handful of trials as practice before launching straight into the test.  \n              Counting up \n            Both groups needed about a second to come up with an answer. Accuracy in both groups declined as the numbers of dots got larger, and when the two possible answers were close together in value (determining if 10 + 10 dots = 19 or 20, for example, would be much harder than working out if 10 + 10 dots = 12 or 20).  \"When the two [possible answer] numbers get larger and closer together, the probability of confusing them increases,\" says Cantlon. \"That was the case in both humans and monkeys.\"  The study beautifully extends previous findings, says Marc Hauser, a cognitive scientist at Harvard University. But the two monkeys performed thousands of trial runs before being tested. A critical next step will be to test the animals in the absence of training, Hauser adds. ?This will be important,? he says, ?especially since the human?animal comparison often breaks down because the former are tested without training and the latter with training.? \n                   Chimp behavior special \n                 \n                   Jessica Cantlon \n                 \n                   PloS Biology \n                 Reprints and Permissions"},

Bullet-like pieces of what is thought to be an ancient meteorite shower have been found embedded in mammoth tusks and bison bone. The discovery of the 2?5 millimetre holes left by meteorites opens a window into a impact event thought to have happened over Alaska and Russia tens of thousands of years ago. And it could provide a whole new way to chart impacts from space. The fragments, found in seven mammoth tusks and the skull and horns of a Siberian bison, match the geochemical composition of iron meteorites. \"We think that the micrometeorites came from an air-burst of a meteor 30,000 to 34,000 years ago,\" says Richard Firestone, co-author of the study and a chemist at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California. \"We think a wave of meteoric material sprayed the region.\" Some of the tusks are peppered with hundreds of the fragments, which had burnt grooves into the bone. All the pieces entered the bones on the skyward surfaces of the tusks and skull. The researchers presented their findings on 11 December at the American Geophysical Union meeting in San Francisco.  \n              Motel dream \n            Strangely, the trail to finding the tusks began at a fossil sale in a motel in Arizona. Allen West, a self-taught geophysicist based in Arizona, was looking for evidence of a meteorite that he and his colleagues think caused the wipe-out of large mammals and the Clovis people in North America some 13,000 years ago. Recalling previous visits to the annual Tucson Gem and Mineral Show, West says, \"A bulb went on in my head; I remembered seeing a room full of mammoth tusks there.\" He reasoned that tusks or antlers of deer or elk might have inadvertently captured exploding meteoritic material. So he went to a motel that shows the fossils, and sifted through the tusks.  \"I spent two or three hours looking at dirty old tusks, when suddenly there was a burnt hole,\" he says. He tested it with a small magnet, as he knew many meteorites were mostly iron. \"Bang; it stuck right to the hole,\" he says. West bought the 60-centimetre tusk for about US$200, and later headed to the warehouse of the company that he bought it from: Canada Fossils. After three days of searching through the company's collection of some 15,000 tusks, West started to find more evidence of micrometeorites in a batch from the Yukutia Peninsula in eastern Siberia. His magnet again repeatedly hit the mark on tell-tale burn holes. West bought these tusks too and took them to Firestone and his colleagues for geochemical analysis and radiocarbon dating.  \n              Past blast \n            The geochemical analysis confirmed that the pieces had a high iron and nickel content, and were low in titanium, making them more likely to be from meteorites than from Earth-bound rocks.  The dating showed that most of the tusks were 30,000 to 34,000 years old, and so not relevant to their theory about the end of the Clovis people (for more on that theory, see  Blast in the past? ). One tusk dated to 21,000 years ago, and the bison skull to 26,000 years old, but Firestone thinks that the dating of these specimens might have been affected by contamination of the samples. Future work, he thinks, will probably show them to be from the same meteorite shower as the other samples. They plan to refine the dates on all specimens as they move towards publication. Firestone and his colleagues note that other scientists have found evidence that the populations of some large mammals ? such as bison, horses and mammoths ? declined about 34,000 years ago. That could go well with a theory of a meteor impact at that time. The researchers hope that their find will spur others to look through fossils for signs of meteor impacts. ?We?re hoping that museums and universities will start examining their collections for similar specimens,? says West. \n                   AGU meeting report \n                 \n                   AGU poster of this work \n                 Reprints and Permissions"},

Gigantic 'rogue' waves that swallow ships have been brought into the laboratory. No one knows exactly how they form in the oceans, but a team at the University of California, Los Angeles, has made similar freak events in light 1 . The researchers say that their work should help to explain this terrifying maritime phenomenon. Rogue waves were originally thought to be a myth. Lone waves tens of metres high had been described in sailors' anecdotes, but it wasn?t until the mid-1990s that they were documented convincingly. One such wave struck an oil platform in the North Sea in 1995, another was photographed in 1993 in the Bay of Biscay. There have been more sightings since. In 2001, for example, a passenger ship in the South Atlantic was hit by a wave about 30 metres high. Yet conventional theories of ocean waves predict that these monsters should be so rare that they would effectively never be seen. It?s now recognized that the oceans defy those theories. Most waves are small; the bigger the wave, the rarer it is. But there is still an anomalously high number of extremely big waves. It isn?t clear why.  Various explanations have been proposed, invoking unusual wave-focusing effects or freak winds. A key feature of rogue waves is that they stay as sharp peaks as they move, making them look like ?walls of water?. This is a similar to ?self-reinforcing solitary waves? or solitons, which can sweep over large distances without dispersing, keeping the same size and shape.  Solitons were first observed in a Scottish canal in the nineteenth century. They are now well studied in light as well as in water. So Daniel Solli and his colleagues wondered whether they could use the techniques known to generate optical solitons to make rogue waves in light.  \n              Drowning in noise \n            They added a little bit of noise to a series of light pulses in a ?nonlinear? optical fibre, in which the shape and frequencies of light coming out doesn?t depend in a simple way on those of the light going in. The noise turns the pulses into a dim signal made up of many frequencies. But within this ?broadband? output there are some extremely bright and narrow spikes ? even narrower and more intense than the peaks going in. These are the optical equivalent of rogue ocean waves, they report in  Nature . The spikes could happen purely by chance, but the team found that they saw ?rogue solitons? much more often than simple random statistics would predict. ?The noise is a seed that acts to focus the energy of the pulse into an intense rogue pulse,? Solli says. ?This is the first observation of man-made rogue waves,? says team leader Bahram Jalali. And they are not so different from the water-going versions. ?Optical rogue waves bear a close connection to their oceanic cousins,? says Solli.  Whether the mechanism for rogue formation is the same at sea as it is in the lab remains unclear. But the ingredients all seem to be there: waves, nonlinearity and a little noise. ?Water-wave propagation is already known to be nonlinear,? says Solli. And 'wave noise' could come from factors such as changing wind direction.  So Solli says that experiments such as these ?may help to resolve the mystery of oceanic rogue waves.? Jalali adds that their observations could be used to develop mathematical models to identify the conditions that lead to such events. Perhaps it might even be possible one day to forecast a danger of rogue waves just as we can now issue storm warnings ? a help to those at risk from these whopping events. Reprints and Permissions"},

A component found in semen can enhance HIV transmission by as much as 100,000-fold, researchers have found. The results, if verified in a clinical setting, could identify a new way to help prevent the spread of the disease.  \"I think this is tremendous,\" says Christopher Pilcher, an HIV researcher at the University of California, San Francisco, who was not affiliated with the study. \"It raises a lot of really fundamental questions about how HIV is transmitted.\" Over 80% of HIV infections are acquired through sexual intercourse, primarily via semen from HIV-positive men. Pilcher says that researchers have been studying the role of semen in HIV transmission, but have focused primarily on the quantity and type of virus contained in semen. \"We?ve looked at everything except the semen itself,\" he says. Now researchers have found that peptides clustered together into long fibres may be more important for HIV transmission than viral load. ?If that?s true, then we?ve been looking at the wrong thing for a long time,? says Pilcher.  \n              Helping to infect ourselves \n            The fibres are the latest in a growing list of products produced by the body that affect HIV infection. Earlier this year, Frank Kirchhoff of the University of Ulm in Germany, together with Wolf-Georg Forssmann of IPF PharmaCeuticals in Hannover, Germany, and their colleagues, reported the isolation of a peptide found in blood that inhibits HIV entry into cells (see  Natural peptide protects against HIV ).  Now, Kirchhoff and Forssmann have taken a similar approach using semen. They collected peptides and small proteins harvested from semen and then screened the compounds in cell cultures to determine the effects on HIV infectivity. They found that fragments of a protein called 'prostatic acidic phosphatase' strongly enhanced HIV transmission. The peptides were most active when they clustered together to form fibres called amyloid fibrils. Depending on the laboratory assay being used, the fibres enhanced transmission of the virus by as little as 30-fold or as much as 400,000-fold. The results are published this week in  Cell 1 . The researchers also tested the fibres in rats that were engineered to be susceptible to HIV infection. Rats injected with both the fibres and HIV had five times more viral DNA in their blood than those injected with HIV alone.  \n              Seminal fibres \n            Many human proteins can form amyloid fibrils, and these fibres are associated with several diseases including Alzheimer?s disease, Parkinson?s disease and diabetes. But none had been previously shown to affect virus transmission, says Per Westermark, who studies the fibrils at Uppsala University in Sweden. The seminal fibres physically capture the HIV virus, the researchers found, and help HIV to interact with host cells in culture. This suggests that drugs that prevent HIV from binding to the fibres could slow HIV spread, says Westermark.  Robin Shattock, an HIV researcher at St. George's, University of London, who has also been studying HIV transmission, says the results are promising but cautions against reading too much into them without additional clinical studies. The researchers performed many of their experiments with purified peptide, he notes, which may not behave in the same way that it would in unmodified semen. ?The definitive experiments have not been done,? says Shattock. Shattock argues that the peptide fibres need to be tested in a non-human primate by exposing mucosal surfaces to HIV in the presence or absence of semen. Meanwhile, Pilcher estimates that clinical studies in humans could evaluate the relationship between seminal peptide-fibre content and HIV transmission within the next few years. \n                   AIDS web special \n                 \n                   Nature Collection: AIDS \n                 \n                   Nature Supplement: Host-microbe interactions \n                 \n                   Nature Insight: AIDS \n                 \n                   Cell \n                 \n                   World Health Organization: HIV/AIDS \n                 \n                   Center for Disease Control: HIV Factsheet \n                 Reprints and Permissions"},

Some Antarctic orcas use the cunning tactic of regularly hunting in packs and making waves to wash seals off floating ice, researchers have confirmed. The behaviour was first seen in 1979, but at the time it was considered a one-time moment of orca ingenuity. Now, Ingrid Visser of the Orca Research Trust in New Zealand and her colleagues report on six further observations of the animals using group hunting behaviour to divide ice floes, push them into open water, and create waves to wash animals off them into their waiting jaws. The behaviour has been seen only along the Antarctic Peninsula and nowhere else in the world, they note, including other icy orca habitats in the Arctic and Antarctic. The report is published 1  in the journal  Marine Mammal Science , and a recent video of the behaviour is available on  You Tube  (with the key moment happening 2 minutes 40 seconds into the tape). It is not the first time a complex behaviour has been seen in just a few orcas. In the early 1970s, an orca was seen in Argentina beaching itself next to seals. At first it seemed to be in distress, but then it lunged at seals nearby, grabbed one by the neck, and dragged it back into the water. This beaching hunting technique has since been observed hundreds of times in Argentina among a small group of orcas. Studies have shown that the orcas can time their forays onto land to coincide with the tides, so they run less risk of becoming permanently beached.  \n              Hunting school \n            Both the beaching and the wave hunting seem to be techniques that pod elders teach to younger animals. The Argentinean orcas have been seen nudging youngsters onto the shore, encouraging them to try the tactic, often coming up alongside to demonstrate. In the group at the Antarctic Peninsula, young orcas are often present during the hunt, and adults sometimes put living seals back on the ice after catching them, seemingly so that the young can have another try. ?This is orca culture,? says Visser.  The unique cultural characteristics of different orca pods may spur a reconsideration of their conservation status says Astrid van Ginneken at the Center for Whale Research in Friday Harbor, Washington.  Orcas ( Orcinus orca ) are not considered an endangered or threatened species; they are found in all the world's oceans. Some local populations, however, are threatened by changes to their habitat. Whether subsets of orcas with unique cultures should be considered separately is a matter that has not really been dealt with, she says. ?Distinct social populations with specialized traditions are far more at risk than the genetic population, and our conservation policies need to reflect that,? says van Ginneken. \n                   The Orca Research Center \n                 \n                   Hubbs SeaWorld Research Institute \n                 Reprints and Permissions"},

If you say something to a gerbil, will it understand? Two researchers have succeeded in training gerbils to recognize human vowel sounds, and have found that they can easily distinguish, say, an 'oo' (as in 'you') from an 'ee' (as in 'me'). Joan Sinnott and Kelly Mosteller of the University of South Alabama in Mobile know, of course, that gerbils are never going to understand the semantics of human speech; they're not trying to train the gerbils to understand words or sentences. Instead, the work will feed into their interest in how humans discriminate between sounds at a very basic level, as infants do before those sounds become part of a known language. A good animal model would provide a useful way of looking at this question. Sinnott says she began by testing monkeys, but found that they were too smart: \"They can hear all the human phonemes [basic speech sounds] I have tested, even the difficult ones,\" she says. So she switched to gerbils.  \n              Call for dinner \n            In their experiments, the researchers presented Mongolian gerbils with two feeder cups: one to the right and one to the left. One vowel sound, pre-recorded and played back repeatedly at intervals of one second, signals that the food is in the left-hand cup. A different vowel sound indicates food in the right-hand cup. The gerbils could learn this rule relatively quickly in tests with pairs of ten different vowel sounds, the researchers say. Like humans, gerbils vary in their abilities. Two of the six gerbils in Sinnott?s group, named Jackson and Washington, were able to distinguish many vowel pairs about nine times out of ten. Others performed less well ? Lincoln was able to discriminate ?aw? as in ?paw? from ?ah? as in (American) ?pot? little better than the 50% level of random choice. But all the gerbils did better than chance for all vowel sounds tested. The researchers presented their findings at the meeting of the Acoustical Society of America in New Orleans last month 1 .  \n              Tongue back \n            Sinnott and Mosteller have studied how and why some vocal sounds are easier to discriminate than others. There are three main frequency components (formants) in human speech: F1, which depends on tongue height; F2, which depends on whether the tongue is at the front or back of the mouth; and a high-frequency component, F3, that can be influenced by tongue curvature. F2 is known to be the most important formant for human speech perception, and the researchers found that for gerbils, too, discrimination improves with increasing difference in F2 (?oo? and ?ee? have the greatest difference). \"It?s a very exciting finding for us,\" they say. \"This result bodes well for using the gerbil as an animal model for human speech perception.\" The animals' short lifespan also means the researchers can study how aural discrimination changes with age.  In humans, hearing is thought to become impaired with age either because of external factors such as exposure to loud noise, poor diet or circulatory problems, or because of intrinsic aspects of the ageing process such as cell death. Sinnott and her co-workers have found previously that gerbils? sound discrimination doesn?t seem to be affected by intrinsic ageing, but only by extrinsic wear and tear 2 . If that is true for humans too, it suggests that age-related hearing deficits are not inevitable. \n                   Acoustical Society of America 154th meeting \n                 \n                   Formants and vowel sounds \n                 Reprints and Permissions"},

A 100-million-year-old carnivorous fungus has been found encased in amber in southwestern France. The find is unusual. Ground-dwelling organisms such as this fungus are much less likely to get trapped in sticky tree resin than are insects that alight on tree trunks. And it is the oldest carnivorous fungus ever found; the previous record-breaker is some 15?20-million years old. The new specimen should help to shed some light on the evolution of these strange creatures. Modern carnivorous fungi capture and kill tiny nematode worms that come to feed on them. Some produce sticky structures that the nematodes get stuck in, others grow small loops that act like a lasso when the nematodes go through. When the nematode dies, the fungus penetrates the worm and digests it. The evolutionary history of these organisms is difficult to study. They do not have hard parts such as skeletons or shells, so when they die everything rots away. As a result, determining when they first appeared has proven difficult. So the amber-encased sample is an important find.  \n              Worm lasso \n            Alexander Schmidt at Humboldt University of Berlin in Germany and his colleagues report 1  in  Science  that the encased fungus has loops that are similar to those seen in modern fungi. The loops are just the right size (about 10 micrometres across) to ensnare the nematodes also found in the amber-preserved specimen. One loop contains some detritus, they report, that could be the remains of a nematode that fell into the fungal trap 100 million years ago. \"Fossils showing these interactions are such rare things. This is a once in a lifetime find,\" says Michael Krings at the Bavarian State Collection for Palaeontology and Geology in Munich. Discovering that the nematode feeding system was around 100 million years ago is \"saying quite a lot\" says Schmidt.  Despite the similarities between modern and ancient carnivorous fungi, Schmidt does not think that the find is closely related to any carnivorous species alive today. The loops of the fossil fungus consist of just one elongated cell each, whereas those on modern carnivorous fungi consist of three cells, notes Schmidt. The structures seem to have the same nematode-trapping function, but are not formed in the same way, as if they evolved independently along different branches of the tree of life. \n                   University of California Berkeley: Fossil Fungi  \n                 \n                   Association of British Fungus Groups \n                 Reprints and Permissions"},

Lice harboured by farmed fish are killing wild salmon on Canada?s west coast, new work has confirmed. The study shows serious declines in fish populations, which could lead to the total collapse of runs in those rivers in less than a decade. Salmon lice ( Lepeophtheirus salmonis ) are natural parasites of fish in Canadian waters. They usually infect adult salmon, which can tolerate mild infestations well. The trouble begins when naturally infected wild pink salmon return to their home rivers to spawn, swimming past nets full of farmed Atlantic salmon on their way. Their lice shed larvae, which settle and thrive on the farmed fish. The wild juveniles then swim out to sea, passing by these shoals of infected farmed fish and dramatically increasing their chance of picking up a louse. The infection can have disastrous consequences on the young fish. Fisheries ecologist Martin Krko?ek at the University of Alberta in Edmonton and his colleagues looked at estimates of the number of salmon returning to each of 71 rivers along the central coast of British Columbia from 1970 to 2006, and found that before the louse infestations began in 2001 the populations were stable. Fish from seven of those rivers had to swim by at least one fish farm. Once the infestation took hold, those populations began to decline, even though they had been closed to commercial fishing. In 2002, most of the young pink salmon that had swum past farm pens on their seaward journey failed to return: fisheries managers expected 3.6 million fish, but counted only 147,000. Runs of pink salmon in the rest of British Columbia were healthy that year.  \n              Home run \n            In 2003, fisheries managers had emptied their farm nets before the smolts left their natal streams, to prevent lice transmission. This seemed to work. Fewer juveniles picked up lice and Krko?ek calculated that deaths from lice fell to 1/3 the rate seen the year before.  But the farm fish are back in their pens now; there are at present no plans to remove the fish again. At the current rate of decline, the runs in these rivers will drop to less than 1% of their natural levels in four generations, or eight years, the team reports in  Science. ?Right now, we?re already half way along that curve,? Krko?ek says.  ?This is a cautionary tale,? says Ray Hilborn, a fisheries biologist at the University of Washington in Seattle. Although farming currently threatens ?only a handful? of the salmon runs in this region, regulators should respond cautiously to the growing demand for fish farming, he says. ?It raises the concern that you could have some other more contagious pathogen that could be incubated in the farms and then spread around from there.?

The information in a beam of light can be stored for a while by converting it into a sound signal, then reading it back out again as light, researchers have found. The process, which can be done in commercially-available optical fibres, could be used to help make computer processing more efficient in future. Data can be sent great distances at speed in beams of light: modern optical networks, like those used to transmit information in the internet, can deliver 10 gigabits of information per second. But the information can't be processed as quickly. To get around this, optical bits are turned into electric signals that can be stored for a short time and then turned back into optical signals to be read. But this process generates heat, and as more bits need to be moved around, more heat is going to be generated. In future, even greater speeds of information delivery mean that electronic processing will no longer be viable.  \n              The sound of light \n            Researchers wondered whether they could get around this problem by turning the signal into sound instead. Daniel Gauthier, at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina, and his colleagues have demonstrated that this might be possible.  They first send optical data as a stream of light pulses into a short piece of standard optical fibre. Into the other end of the fibre they send a different short pulse: the 'write' pulse. When the two sets of pulses collide, they interfere, and an interference pattern is set up in the fibre with areas of high and low intensity. This interference pattern in turn affects the physical properties of the fibre, setting up an acoustic wave because of a phenomenon called electrostriction.  As the light pulse leaves the fibre, the acoustic wave with all its inherited information lags behind: the speed of light in the fibre, at some 200 million metres per second, far exceeds the more sluggish 5,000 metres per second of sound. ?The acoustic wave is essentially stationary over the duration of our experiment,? says Gauthier, whose work is published in  Science 1 . To get the information from the acoustic wave out again, a third light pulse, the 'read' pulse, is sent in. When it reaches the part of the fibre being affected by the acoustic wave, the light scatters in such a way as to regain the information that was left behind by the initial pulse. The newly-formed data pulse leaves the fibre, resuming the journey in the same direction as the original pulse, taking the same information with it.  In the tests done so far, a 2-nanosecond pulse could be held in the fibre for up to 12 nanoseconds. ?What is so cool about this process is that the original data stream is recreated with reasonable fidelity,? says Gauthier: the initial light pulse and the emerging one have nearly the same shape. In theory it is possible to have perfect fidelity. But this relies on a mass of certain conditions that haven't yet been achieved.  \n              Still work to do \n            A big problem for Gauthier?s system at the moment lies in the power of the read and write pulses. At the moment, this needs to be about 100W. ?This is beyond the power levels of most of current optical components ? some might simply evaporate,? says Ortwin Hess, at the University of Surrey in Guildford, UK, who recently proposed a different, theoretical way to store light (see  How to trap a rainbow ). But Hess is sure that the problems can be worked on. ?It?s a first proof of principal,? he says. ?It underpins the strong need for achieving and finding ways to have optical storage.?  ?I think there is a very realistic chance we can achieve at least a 100-fold reduction [in the peak power] using materials that are currently available,? says Gauthier, ?It will just take time and a little money.? Other light-storage systems, apart from the ones proposed by Gauthier and Hess, involve very cold gases, or only work on a single frequency of light. But Gauthier?s system works at room temperature, with standard optical fibres that work with a wide range of frequencies. \"Our method could easily integrate with existing technologies,\" says Gauthier.

A mammoth bureaucratic battle is looming between senior European Commission officials and national governments that could affect the long-term prospects for the cultivation of genetically modified crops on the continent. Late last month, the European Commission's environment commissioner Stavros Dimas said that he plans to reject applications from Syngenta and Pioneer Hi-Bred International for approval to grow two transgenic strains of maize (corn), on the grounds that the crops could adversely affect the environment. Dimas's position has been welcomed by environmental groups and attacked by industry lobbyists. And researchers point out that it ignores the recommendation Dimas received from his own scientific advisers. But the environment commissioner's move is far from the end of the matter. Behind-the-scenes battles are under way inside the commission, where a powerful faction wants Europe to accept genetically modified crops. That would avoid further conflict with the United States, which has complained to the World Trade Organization (WTO) that European reluctance to approve the crops amounts to protectionism. In particular, the commissioners who are respectively responsible for trade, industry and agriculture ? Peter Mandelson, G\u00fcnter Verheugen and Mariann Fischer Boel ? are trying to overturn Dimas's decision. Observers on both sides of the debate say that, when the dust settles, it is quite possible the European Commission will give the green light to Syngenta's Bt11 maize and Pioneer's 1507 maize, which are genetically engineered to be resistant to both pests and herbicides. At present, only one transgenic crop can be cultivated in Europe: Monsanto's MON810 insect-resistant maize, which now comprises nearly 2% of maize grown in Europe, most of it in Spain and France (see  'Transgenic maize' ). MON810 was approved before 2001, when the European Union (EU) agreed a directive setting out complex rules for the future approval of such crops. Getting the directive agreed in the first place took several years, and came with the proviso that there would be no approvals for import or cultivation until water-tight mechanisms for tracing the transgene, labelling transgenic seeds and governing the safe 'coexistence' of conventional and transgenic plants were in place. That took until 2004. Even as they voted for the directive, some countries ? Austria, Luxembourg, Greece, France, Denmark and Italy ? made it clear that they were still reluctanct to allow the crops in, arguing that the directive should have explicitly taken into account public opinion, which they say is firmly opposed to their cultivation. Under the directive, each candidate strain is assessed for its impact on animal and human health and the environment before a decision is made on whether to approve its cultivation. If a company wants to grow or market a crop in Europe (as food, feed or a derived product), it must apply through a member state. That country can either perform a scientific risk assessment itself for the commission or pass the application to the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) in Parma, Italy, which organizes an assessment through a panel of 21 outside scientists. The EFSA delivers a scientific opinion to the commission's health directorate within six months. Five applications for the import of transgenic maize and oil-seed rape have been approved by this route since 2004. But if the application includes cultivation of the crop, a more extensive environmental risk analysis must be carried out, and this is incorporated into the final scientific opinion delivered to the commission's directorate for the environment. The commission should make a decision within three months. And this is the point where Bt11 and 1507 maize have got stuck. EFSA scientific reports on both varieties concluded that neither would have ?an adverse effect on human and animal health or the environment? in the contexts proposed. Both reports were ready by April 2005, and were updated in November 2006. But it wasn't until last month that a draft decision was circulated inside the European Commission saying that neither crop should be approved for cultivation. It refers to 11 papers published since the EFSA's update that it says cast doubt on the crops' long-term environmental safety. The publications include studies claiming that insecticidal molecules from the plant may persist in water or sediments draining from a cultivated field, and may disturb downstream ecosystems. The environment commissioner did not ask the EFSA panel for an opinion on these additional papers. Garlich von Essen, secretary-general of the European Seed Association, says that this shows ?disdain? for both the EFSA and its advisory system. Marc Van Montagu, a plant geneticist and president of the European Federation of Biotechnology, says the commission has cherry-picked publications claiming possible dangers, and he questions the quality of the selected papers. Environment-commission officials respond that their risk-management process is supposed to reach beyond the EFSA's findings. Once the commission's decision has been finalized, it will go to the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health, which comprises scientists and officials from member states. The standing committee will vote on each proposal using a system ? called the qualified majority vote ? that reflects the size and population of each member state. If the voting is at odds with the commission's position, the dossiers are passed to the EU Environment Council of environment ministers of each member state, who must also vote on each case. But with populous nations such as Spain and the United Kingdom supporting approval, and Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic joining some of the original dissenters, neither side is likely to obtain the two-thirds majority needed to decide the issue. If that happens, under EU rules the final decision will be thrown back to the commission itself. On 26 November, the German agriculture minister Horst Seehofer proposed that this tortuous approval process should be abandoned and a regulatory authority be created with full responsibility for analysing the science and drawing conclusions. ?The reservations of the public are not being sufficiently considered,? he said. ?Until such an authority is created, there should be a moratorium on granting new approvals?. Such reservations are exemplified by the continued resistance of some nations to cultivating MON810 maize, which is grown in only six EU countries. Austria actually banned the import of the maize in 1997, and has since resisted strong pressure to lift the ban, which is illegal under the 2001 directive. In October, France's president Nicolas Sarkozy announced a suspension of the cultivation of transgenic maize until new national rules have been worked out. Sarkozy, who has recently laid out plans for far-reaching environmental improvements in France, seems willing to risk a dispute with the commission (and the WTO) over the issue. Meanwhile, the WTO is putting increasing pressure on the EU, giving it until 11 January to end national moratoriums. The commission says it expects to make its decision on the two maize varieties in January as well, although an exact date has not been set. ?This is a real test case,? says Adrian Bebb, a Brussels-based campaigner for Friends of the Earth. ?But we fear that Dimas's chances of winning are slim.? \n                     European Commission information on biotechnology \n                   \n                     Syngenta website \n                   \n                     Pioneer website \n                   \n                     Monsanto website \n                   \n                     International Service for the Acquisition of Agri-biotech Applications \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

The announcement last week that Europe's largest medical-research facility is to be built in central London has been largely welcomed by Britain's biomedical community, which hopes that the centre will accelerate the translational research ? so beloved by policy-makers ? that brings discoveries from the lab to patients. But the process has ruffled a few scientists' feathers. Prime Minister Gordon Brown says that the government will sell a plot of land between the British Library and the international train station at St Pancras to a consortium of the Medical Research Council (MRC), Cancer Research UK (CRUK), the Wellcome Trust and University College London, for \u00a385 million (US$173 million). The total cost of the UK Centre for Medical Research and Innovation, including purchase of the land, is pegged at more than \u00a3500 million. The MRC and CRUK are expected to shoulder the bulk of the cost, and the Wellcome Trust has committed \u00a3100 million to the project. The centre, which is expected to open in 2013, will employ up to 1,500 researchers and support staff. It aims to compete with other global multidisciplinary scientific-research collaborations such as Biopolis in Singapore, the Allston Initiative at Harvard University and the Science-based Zizhu Industrial Park in Shanghai. ?Being in central London, right alongside main teaching hospitals and main offices for clinical research, is a much better location for translational research,? MRC head Leszek Borysiewicz told  Nature.  ?There is every opportunity for scientists to translate their work with the most appropriate clinical partners when they are that close to each other.? Details of the research projects and teams that will be transferred to the centre remain scarce. Nobel laureate Paul Nurse, who is president of Rockefeller University in New York and CRUK's former director, will head an independent science-planning committee to determine the shape and direction of the centre's work and the facilities needed to carry it out. The project will face numerous hurdles. Some researchers have expressed concerns that the infusion of funding into a prestigious project with limited space could ultimately hamper some basic research already taking place. And choosing to site the centre ? which will include the largest animal-research laboratory in Europe and a category-4 virus containment laboratory ? next to an international transport hub has sparked biosafety concerns. Unease about potential staff reductions and shelving of core research has been particularly pronounced at the MRC's largest research body, the National Institute for Medical Research (NIMR), which will account for the bulk of the MRC's contribution to the new centre. The NIMR's 750 scientists and staff have already experienced nearly four years of debate within the MRC over its plans to move the institute from its current 19-hectare site in Mill Hill, northwest London, to central London. An earlier plan to move the institute to a site next to Euston Station in conjunction with University College London was ditched in March after the proposal faced scathing criticism from a key committee in the House of Commons that had held hearings on the plan. NIMR staffers have previously expressed concerns that the 1.4-hectare site at St Pancras would have insufficient space for the institute's current facilities. Scientists have also criticized MRC executives for poor internal communication over the course of the discussions on the institute's fate, and say that the continuing uncertainty over how much of the NIMR will be transferred to the new research centre is taking a toll on morale. ?It's going to be a very difficult management process to keep people happy,? says Robin Lovell-Badge, head of stem-cell biology and developmental genetics at the NIMR. ?We are very nervous about it. Of course we can see the advantages and we want to be optimistic, but a lot of people at the institute just don't trust the MRC because of its past history.?  \n                Translational medicine \n              Borysiewicz says that Nurse's committee is expected to draw up broad outlines of the new centre's scientific mission over the weeks to come, and he adds that NIMR researchers will be represented on the committee. ?It may be five or six years before the new site is ready,? he says. ?It is the MRC's intention to support the science at the NIMR during that period.? Others think that the move will help their work. Neil McDonald, a structural biologist at CRUK, notes that his current central London lab needs major refurbishment, and says that the new centre was being viewed positively by CRUK's several hundred researchers. ?The advantage of a big research institute, and the synergies involved, are not just economies of scale but accessibility to facilities that you wouldn't be able to afford at a smaller institute,? he says. ?If you are in the same building and you see people in the canteen every day, it promotes collaborations and interactions, not just between research scientists but between scientists and clinicians.? The proposed centre still needs planning permission to go ahead, but with Brown's backing, it is likely to succeed. \n                     Nature Medicine: Allegations fly over fate of UK medical research institute \n                   \n                     Medical Research Council \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Perfectly timed for pantomime season, a team of scientists has come up with instructions for how to make a flying carpet. The magical device may owe more to Walt Disney than to  The Arabian Nights , but it is not pure fantasy, according to Lakshminarayanan Mahadevan of Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and his co-workers. The researchers have studied 1  the aerodynamics of a flexible, rippling sheet moving through a fluid, and find that it should be possible to make one that will stay aloft in air. No such carpet is going to ferry people around, though. The researchers say that to stay afloat in air, a sheet measuring about 10 centimetres long and 0.1 millimetres thick would need to vibrate at about 10 hertz with an amplitude of about 0.25 millimetres. Making a heavier carpet 'fly' is not forbidden by the laws of physics. But the researchers say that their \"computations and scaling laws suggest it will remain in the magical, mystical and virtual realm\", as the engine driving the necessary vibrations would need to be so powerful. The key to a magic carpet is to create uplift by making ripples that push against fluids such as air or water. If it is close to a horizontal surface, like a piece of foil settling down onto the floor, such rippling movements create a high pressure in the gap between the sheet and the floor. \"As waves propagate along a flexible foil, they generate a fluid flow that leads to a pressure that lifts the foil, roughly balancing its weight,\" Mahadevan explains. But as well as lifting it, the ripples can drive the foil forward ? a trait required by any respectable magic carpet. \"If the waves propagate from one edge,\" says Mahadevan, \"this causes the foil to tilt ever so slightly and then move in one direction towards the edge that is slightly higher. Fluid is then squeezed from this end to the other, causing the sheet to progress like a submarine ray.\"  \n                Speed bumps \n              To travel at speed, the carpet would have to undulate in big ripples, comparable to the size of the carpet. This would make the ride very bumpy. \"If you want a smooth ride, you can generate a lot of small ripples,\" says Mahadevan. \"But you'll be slower.\"  \"It's cute, it's charming,\" says physicist Tom Witten at the University of Chicago in Illinois, who is intrigued that the researchers thought to study such an unusual engineering feat.   So could tiny flying carpets really be made? Spontaneous undulating motions have been demonstrated in 'smart' polymers suspended in fluids ? the polymers can be made to swell or shrink in response to external signals. In September, another team at Harvard University described flexible polymer sheets coated with cultured rat muscle cells that flex in response to electrical signals and are able to swim 2 . \"In air, it should be possible to make moving sheets ? a kind of micro hovercraft ? with very light materials, or with very powerful engines,\" Mahadevan says. \n                     Special: history of flight \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

The next time you see a pregnant woman teetering under the awkward weight of her growing belly, remember this: if she were a man, it would be even worse.  Researchers have found that the vertebrae that make up a woman?s spine have evolved to give her more support, probably to help her cope during pregnancy. The results hold true for modern mothers as well as those of their ancient ancestors,  Australopithecus,  who lived more than two million years ago. Vertebrae in men lack these features. Without this added support, women would have to draw more on their back muscles to stay upright. Over the course of nine months, that could lead to muscle fatigue and back injury. When human ancestors made the switch from walking on four legs to walking on two, they had to make several skeletal adjustments. Vertebrae increased in number and thickness to provide added support to the upper body. The spine took on a curved shape in the lower back, to shift the shoulders backwards and move the centre of mass above the hips. But the added bulk of pregnancy shifts that centre of mass forwards again, making a woman more likely to tip over towards the front. Pregnant women bring their centre of mass back over their hips by leaning back, deepening the curve at the base of their spine.  \n              Back bend \n            Katherine Whitcome and Daniel Lieberman from Harvard University in Cambridge, together with their colleague Liza Shapiro of the University of Texas at Austin, measured the centre of mass of 19 pregnant women and found that they leaned back by as much as 28\u00a3 beyond the normal curve of the spine, they report in  Nature 1 . The researchers found this lowers the torque around the hip created by the baby's weight by roughly eight times. Exaggerating the curve in the lower back can place more stress on the spine: vertebrae are more likely to slip against each other, leading to back pain or fractures. Whitcome and her colleagues found that a woman?s spine has several features that help to prevent that damage. In women, the curve in the lower back spans three vertebrae; in men, it encompasses just two. The added vertebra helps distribute the strain over a wider area. In addition, specialized joints located behind the spinal cord, called zygapophyseal joints, are 14% larger relative to vertebrae size in women than in men, suggesting that the joints are well adapted to resist the higher force. The joints are also oriented at a slightly different angle in women, allowing them to better brace the vertebrae against slipping. Aside from the more obvious biological factors, this makes women more suited to carrying a baby. \"I would advise all of my male colleagues not to become pregnant,\" jokes Karen Steudel, a biological anthropologist at the University of Wisconsin, Madison.  \n              Running with baby \n            The researchers looked for, and found, the same trends between males and females in two  Australopithecus  fossils.  The adaptations would have been important back then, says Lieberman, ?Imagine strapping seven kilos to your belly and then leading a really active life hunting, gathering, running away from predators,? he says. The results highlight the importance of a healthy lower back for survival, says Carol Ward, a palaeoanthropologist at the University of Missouri in Columbia. ?A bad back really impairs your ability to move around and find food,? says Ward. ?So there would be strong selection for individuals to have less back pain.? Given that until recently, women spent much of their adult lives pregnant, adaptations to protect the back during pregnancy would be particularly important, she says. Whitcome is now looking at the effect of child rearing on vertebrae, and Ward notes that it would be interesting to see how these changes integrate with adaptations made for long-distance running. Some think that the need for long-distance running has provided a key selective force in human evolution (see  Distance running shaped human evolution ). ?But as anybody who?s been 9-months' pregnant knows, running is not the thing you want to be doing,? says Ward. \n                   Hominid Evolution and Development Web Focus \n                 \n                   Harvard University Skeletal Biology Lab \n                 \n                   Carol Ward \n                 \n                   Karen Steudel \n                 Reprints and Permissions"},

Hospitals across North America have been forced to cancel tests for cancer and heart disease because the unexpected closure of a Canadian nuclear reactor has led to a sudden shortage of medical isotopes. The 50-year-old National Research Universal (NRU) reactor located in Chalk River, Ontario, was shut down on 18 November for scheduled maintenance and was due back online by mid-December. But Atomic Energy Canada, which owns and operates the facility, extended the outage to install safety-related equipment, including upgrades to the reactor cooling pumps. The reactor supplies about 60% of the molybdenum isotopes used in medical applications globally, including molybdenum-99, which decays into technetium-99m and is used in about 16 million nuclear medicine procedures annually in the United States. ?It's a disaster for patients,? says Sandy McEwan, president of the Society of Nuclear Medicine. North American hospitals now have 20?30% of the medical isotopes they require, he says. Hospitals use a generator to extract technetium-99m from a source of decaying molybdenum-99. A technetium-99m isotope has a useful life of about one week, but can be stretched to two. MDS Nordion, an Ottawa-based life-sciences firm and molybdenum supplier to Bristol-Myers Squibb Medical Imaging, says it expects shortages of the radioisotope until mid-January. Molybdenum-99 has a half-life of 66 hours and cannot be stockpiled. Reactors in Australia, South Africa and Brussels also produce molybdenum-99. The shortage has reignited a discussion over securing the US supply of medical isotopes by building a reactor in the United States. The NRU reactor was to be decommissioned in 2005, but its operating licence was extended until problems with two replacement reactors ? MAPLE 1 and 2 ? could be solved. The two MAPLE reactors and a processing facility were designed to supply the entire global demand for molybdenum-99, iodine-131, iodine-125 and xenon-133. In June, Atomic Energy Canada said that it expected MAPLE 1 and the processing facility to be in service by October 2008, and MAPLE 2 by October 2009. Reprints and Permissions"},

A team of experts from the World Heath Organization (WHO) is making its way north in Pakistan to investigate a cluster of at least eight cases of avian flu in people living near the Afghan border. They will be seeking to establish whether the disease is spreading, and whether the cases were caused by human-to-human transmission.  Cases of bird flu continue to occur worldwide, mostly in Indonesia, and this is the colder time of year when flu is expected to hit hardest in the northern hemisphere. But this latest outbreak is worrying in that it involves the biggest batch of closely related cases since a cluster of eight infected people was reported in Indonesia in May 2006. \"So far, we are not seeing anything different than in previous instances of H5N1 outbreaks,\" says Gregory Hartl, a spokesman for WHO, whose current information comes from Pakistani authorities. The Pakistan cases started in mid-November, or possibly earlier, when five family members fell ill in Abbottabad, north of Islamabad. Two of the brothers have died, one of whom was buried before he could be tested for H5N1. In December, a man and his niece in the same town were found to have H5N1. They are thought to have worked on the same farm as the first family affected. Another man was found to have H5N1 in a nearby town some distance from there. Another case is suspected but not yet confirmed, which would bring the cluster to nine. Pakistan has had repeated outbreaks of avian flu in poultry over the past two years.   \n              On the track \n            The WHO team will be tracking down, treating and testing people who came into contact with the infected cases. Monitoring for cases in the area will be key to establishing whether the virus has become more virulent or shows signs of spreading.  Meanwhile, Pakistani health authorities are poring over hospital records from the past few months to see, retrospectively, whether there has been any upsurge in the incidence of respiratory illnesses.  Human-to-human transmission cannot be ruled out, says Hartl, as it has occurred on a limited basis on several occasions in the past. Tests of 40 people who have had contact with the patients have so far all turned up negative. Genetic sequencing will help to pin down the mode of transmission and whether any important genetic changes have occurred in the virus.  \n              Early warning \n            The Pakistan cluster highlights the obstacles faced by the WHO in containing the spread should a pandemic strain of H5N1 appear. The strategy calls for early diagnosis of cases, in the hope that blanket treatment with antivirals will stamp out an emerging pandemic before it spirals out of control. Computer models suggest that for this to have any chance of succeeding, WHO would have a window of three weeks for this diagnosis at most.  But although the first cases occurred in mid-November at the latest, Pakistan only officially informed WHO on 12 December, a day after the first media reports. WHO made the cases public on 15 December.  Last Friday, the WHO also confirmed the first case in Myanmar: a 7-year old girl from Kyaing Tone Township, Shan State, who was hospitalized in late November, and has since recovered. A WHO team has so far found no evidence of infections in any of the case's contacts or in the area. \n                   Nature Reports Avian Flu \n                 \n                   Avian flu focus \n                 \n                   Bird flu focus \n                 \n                   WHO avian flu site \n                 \n                   OIE report on Pakistan poultry outbreaks \n                 Reprints and Permissions"},

Does a racehorse?s success come from its genes? New research shows that genetics really do play an important part in whether a horse will be a winner or a loser on the racetrack. But it also hints that a high stud fee might not guarantee getting the good genes: horse breeders don't always get what they pay for. Evolutionary ecologists Alastair Wilson and Andrew Rambaut at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland took a detailed look at the genetics of racehorses. They obtained data for the lifetime earnings of 554 currently or recently active stallions used for breeding, as well as the earnings of their ancestors going back several generations. This gave them a database of 4,476 horses going back to 1922, with full lifetime performance statistics for 2,500 of them. They used these data to model the estimated lifetime earnings of the children of the current studs. They found that environmental factors such as training, diet, strategic race entry and jockey skill accounted for 91.5% of the variation in a horse's winnings and 8.5% of the effect was genetic. ?8.5% may seem small, but for those of us studying the benefits generated by genetics in wild animals this is huge,? says Wilson. In the wild, where environmental conditions vary a lot and survival can depend on luck as much as anything else, genetics usually account for about 1-2% of survival rates, says Wilson. But in the highly regulated environment of racehorses, where winning races is the main measure of success, genetics has a much bigger effect.  \n              Getting what you pay for \n            The team also wanted to see if stud prices were indicative of genetics. These prices can vary wildly: mild-mannered stallions can cost hundreds of dollars, and stallions with grand reputations can cost millions. In their sample, they report, the stud price was not linked to the success of the offspring. Amongst these horses, paying a few hundred to breed a mare with an average racing stallion was as good as paying a few million. ?We expected stud fees to be honest signals [of success] but they were not,? says Wilson.  These findings might be skewed, says Larry Bramlage, an equine orthopaedic surgeon in Lexington Kentucky, because they look at studs with a mix of ages. Some are so young that their stud price depends solely on their own success (which is largely the result of environmental effects that can't be passed on to progeny), and some are old enough that their price is weighed entirely on the success of their offspring. The latter, he notes, is a much better measure of genetic quality, and most horse breeders know that.  ?If you took the stud fees of stallions that had been breeding for at least ten years, I think you would get a very different result,? Bramlage says. In such a sample, he thinks genetics would link to price. This is a fair point, says Wilson, and should be accounted for in future studies. \n                   British horseracing \n                 \n                   Blood-horse magazine \n                 \n                   American Association of Equine Practitioners \n                 \n                   Weatherbys: British horseracing  \n                 Reprints and Permissions"},

Researchers have successfully treated sickle-cell anemia in mice by using stem-cell lines created from cells at the tip of a mouse tail. It is the first demonstration that ?induced pluripotent stem cells? ? adult cells that have been reprogrammed to behave more like embryonic stem cells ? can be used therapeutically. The work is a critical step towards establishing whether these cells could one day lead to therapies derived from an individual?s own tissue, eliminating the risk of rejection by the immune system. But researchers are quick to caution that there is still much to be done before the cells are ready for human trials.  \"It demonstrates a very important, pre-clinical proof of principle,\" says George Daley, a stem-cell researcher at Children?s Hospital Boston in Massachusetts, who was not an author on the study. ?But it also highlights that many, many questions linger about the safety of these cells.? More than five years ago, Daley and Rudolf Jaenisch of the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research in Cambridge, Massachusetts, used therapeutic cloning to create embryonic stem cells capable of correcting a genetic immune deficiency 1 . But that method was technically challenging and, for some, ethically worrisome because of its use of embryos.   Since then, researchers have learned how to reprogramme mouse and human adult cells to behave more like embryonic stem cells. The resulting cells, called induced pluripotent stem cells, are able to differentiate into many different cell types. But their therapeutic potential had not yet been established. Researchers have been clamouring to try out the new cells on their favourite disease models.  \n              Model disease \n            Jaenisch decided to use the cells to tackle sickle-cell anaemia because the genetic basis of the disease is well understood and the mouse models closely mimics the human disease. So Jaenisch, along with Tim Townes of the University of Alabama at Birmingham and their colleagues, generated induced pluripotent stem cells from a mouse with a sickle-cell mutation in one of its globin genes. The team then engineered the induced pluripotent stem cells to become healthy blood-producing cells, by replacing the defective globin gene with a normal copy. The stem cells were then transplanted back into three genetically identical sick mice, which had been irradiated to destroy their faulty blood-producing cells.  Twelve weeks after the procedure, mice treated with the engineered stem cells had more normal blood, including higher red-blood-cell counts and hemoglobin content, than untreated sickle-cell mice. The results are published this week in  Science 2 .  \n              Weighing the risks \n            Transplantation of induced pluripotent stem cells can carry a high cancer risk. The researchers lowered this risk by not using one particular cell reprogramming ingredient: a cancer-causing protein called c-Myc. Three months after the transplant, there was still no sign of tumours in these mice. But that doesn?t mean that tumours won?t show up eventually, cautions Jaenisch.  Researchers won?t really know how well these cells stack up against adult stem cells or embryonic stem cells until they are directly compared, says Evan Snyder, a director at the Burnham Institute for Medical Research in La Jolla, California. ?Ultimately one really needs to do this with all the various flavours of stem cells out there,? says Snyder. ?One needs to compare them head-to-head, and let the data dictate which is the safest and which is the most efficacious.\" It may be that different diseases will be best treated by using different kinds of stem cells, or even combinations of stem cells. ?It?s just like an artist who has a really wide palette of colours,? says Snyder. ?To give you a beautiful picture, we want to be free to dabble in all the colours.? \n                   Nature Insight: Stem cells \n                 \n                   Nature Reports Stem Cells \n                 \n                   The Niche: Stem Cell Blog \n                 \n                   Science  \n                 \n                   Rudolf Jaenisch \n                 \n                   George Daley \n                 \n                   Evan Snyder \n                 Reprints and Permissions"},

It's by no means the only way to prioritize conservation efforts. But the EDGE project scientists are working to catalogue and protect these unique creatures, funnelling funding into the most neglected of these species. On the EDGE top-100 list of mammals, the jerboa ranks 81st and the camel 8th. An EDGE expedition to the desert in August and September of this year served to kick off several research projects, in which local scientists are funded to investigate animals' distribution, behaviour, habitat and various threats that may face them, so that informed conservation plans can be drawn up. Very little is known about long-eared jerboas at present, including how many of them are left: ?No one has any idea,? says Jonathan Baillie, head of field conservation at the Zoological Society and a member of the expedition team.  The EDGE trip revealed how the jerboa is threatened by habitat disturbance and introduced predators. ?In the region we were in, there was agriculture in the middle of the desert. They?re growing watermelons,? says Baillie. These unsustainable practices are altering the natural landscape, he says. ?There?s also illegal mining using the limited water resources.? In addition, the locals have adopted cats to eliminate rodents, and these can take up to 20 jerboas in a single night. ?The long-eared jerboa eats primarily insects ? it isn?t a pest [to crops] in the first place,? notes Baillie. Video footage  shows the jerboa scampering about at night. Field research also showed how it seals itself into its burrow, presumably for temperature regulation. The team also managed to spot Bactrian camels with young, proving that these rare animals are still breeding.  The jerboa and the camel will receive further research attention, followed by an action plan for the jerboa as soon as 2009. ?We go from a species that has had no attention to ensuring conservation,? says Baillie. Next for the EDGE project will be a list of most evolutionary distinct and endangered amphibians, coming in January 2008, followed by a similar list for birds, Baillie says. \n                   EDGE Mongolia blog \n                 Reprints and Permissions"},

Do dry baseballs go further than wet ones? Not according to new research. The study pours cold water on the practice of using humidified balls, which is done in some parks in an attempt to level the playing-field. Edmund Meyer and John Bohn of the University of Colorado at Boulder used simulations to show that the aerodynamics of a moistened baseball are actually slightly better than those of a dry one 1 . The work, posted on the popular ArXiv preprint server, adds to a growing body of evidence that humidified balls are, for all practical purposes, as easy to hit as their dry counterparts. The work was spurred by a problem facing the Colorado Rockies, the researchers' local major-league team. The Rockies' home park, Coors Field in Denver, Colorado, sits some 1.6 kilometres above sea level, and the thinned air at that altitude allows hitters to slug more balls out of the ballpark. According to Meyer, an avid baseball fan, the situation is so bad that the Rockies have had trouble recruiting pitchers to play on the team: the fear is that the high home-run rate would drag down a pitcher's 'earned run average', or ERA. As a way of solving the problem, the Rockies began storing their balls in humidors at 50% humidity in 2002. The theory was that the ball would be heavier and swollen, so players would have to hit them harder and they would fly less easily through the air. The move, which is legal under Major League rules, has been accompanied by a small decline in the park's cumulative ERA since 2002, says Meyer.  The physicists wanted to check if the wet balls were really worse fliers, and if this could account for the drop in ERA. \"We wanted to know if it could be solely because of aerodynamics,\" says Meyer.  \n              Flying high \n            The duo measured the mass and diameter of 15 baseballs stored for two weeks at relative humidities of 32%, 56% and 74%. They then fed their data into computer models to calculate the drag on the humidified balls. Surprisingly, they found that drag actually dropped as balls became more humid. The reason, according to Meyer, is that the increased mass allows the ball to cut through the air more easily. This more than offsets the increased air drag from the tiny increase in surface area.  The team also dispelled the myth that humidified balls were easier to pitch as curveballs ? another factor cited in the drop in home-run statistics. Again, says Meyer, the density of the humidified ball was the key factor. Because the ball was heavier, he says, it was harder to make it curve than a lighter, drier ball. But these effects weren't large: the bottom line is that humidified balls don't change things much, says Meyer. \"I'd say the role of the humidor is more psychology than pure physics.\"  \n              Balls-up \n            The work is a major step forwards in the obscure field of moist baseball physics, according to David Kagan, a physicist at California State University at Chico. Kagan has conducted his own studies showing that humid balls don't spring off the bat as well, and so travel slightly less far than their dry counterparts.  That sounds as if it might explain the effect of wet balls not going the distance. But Kagan's findings show that the effect at 50% humidity would be too small to significantly alter the ERA at Coors Field.  So why has the ERA at Coors Field dropped since the humidor was introduced? The drop is extremely small and the ballpark remains in the top four for home runs, notes Meyer. But the change is unexplained and merits further investigation. One intriguing possibility is that humidified balls are easier for pitchers to grip. Meyer and Bohn are now planning a follow-up study. \"Baseballs can provide an unlimited list of interesting questions for physicists to study,\" says Kagan. \n                   Bohn and Meyer's paper \n                 \n                   More on the Physics of Baseball \n                 Reprints and Permissions"},

Cancer researchers from around Asia met in Nanjing, China, last month to hammer out plans for a regional network to coordinate epidemiology data and prevention. The network would gather data from cancer registries in countries from the Philippines to Turkey ? an area that has two-thirds of the world's population and more than half of its 7.6 million cancer deaths each year, according to the World Health Organization. Most of these nations have registries, but the data are not always accurate or standardized, says Kazuo Tajima, director of the Aichi Cancer Centre Research Institute in Nagoya, Japan, who is one of the meeting's organizers. ?There is currently no way to compare notes,? he says. The Asian Cancer Registry and Information Network, as it is being mooted, would establish the region's first hub ? probably in Japan ? to hold standardized data, which could then be used for epidemiological research, cancer risk assessment and prevention planning. It would offer some of the less-developed countries in the region a chance to catch up with modern diagnostic techniques and offer comparisons that might help figure out why, for example, incidence of liver cancer is so high in Mongolia. The network would also offer an opportunity to tease out the role of Asian genes in the development of some cancers and the reaction to particular drugs. ?Most of the data used in cancer studies are from Westerners,? says Sumio Sugano, a genomics specialist at the University of Tokyo who attended the International Union against Cancer (UICC) symposium in Nanjing. ?This is a chance to use Asian data.? The organizers anticipate difficulties stemming from concerns over the privacy of data. ?We have to move one step at a time,? says Sugano. ?Building trust among researchers is the first step.? Organizers of the meeting hope that the network's activities can bridge some of the animosity present in the historicaly fractious region. The meeting was funded by Japan's Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, partly to celebrate the 35th anniversary of normalization of Sino?Japanese diplomatic relations. The next meeting will be in Manila in March. Norie Kawahara, a research fellow at the Research Center for Advanced Science and Technology at the University of Tokyo, says the site location, Nanjing, where hundreds of thousands of Chinese were massacred by the Japanese military 70 years ago ? an event that is denied by some right-wing historians in Japan ? was a symbolic choice. A few years ago, when Kawahara started pushing the idea of a Japan-led Asian network, she says people refused, thinking that it sounded like a return to the Greater East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere, the euphemistic name that Japan gave to its colonizing activities in the region. She hopes that through such activities as the anti-smoking, anti-cancer campaign she ran in a parallel session at last month's meeting, targeted at Chinese and Japanese children, she can ?use science to rewrite history?. Tajima is applying for \u00a360 million (US$542,000) over 3 years to push Japan's role as a hub for the network in the future. ?But we won't need gigantic sums of money,? says Malcolm Moore, head of the UICC Asia regional office in Bangkok. ?What is needed is for people to get together and participate.? \n                     International Union Against Cancer \n                   \n                     International Association of Cancer Registries \n                   \n                     European Network of Cancer Registries \n                   \n                     North American Association of Central Cancer Registries \n                   \n                     Inernational Agency for Research on Cancer \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Most people tend to learn from their mistakes and avoid making the same blunder twice. Now research reveals a genetic mutation that helps to determine the extent to which certain people are doomed to repeat history. Drug addicts, alcoholics and compulsive gamblers are known to be more likely than other people to have this genetic mutation, which leaves them with fewer receptors of a certain type in the brain. These receptors ? called D2 receptors ? are activated when levels of the neurotransmitter dopamine drop. Dopamine is responsible for signalling fun and pleasure in the brain. But dopamine also helps us learn. When we make a pleasurable decision, dopamine is a chemical treat, urging the brain to repeat the choice. Being deprived of such a treat should theoretically activate D2 receptors and encourage people not to make that same decision again. So it had been theorized that people with fewer D2 receptors might be less capable of learning from negative reinforcement.  \n              Avoid the frowns \n            To test this, Tilmann Klein and Markus Ullsperger at the Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences in Leipzig, Germany, looked at the decision-making of 26 men, while monitoring their brains with a magnetic resonance imaging scanner. Twelve of the volunteers had the gene mutation for low numbers of D2 receptors. The researchers chose men because dopamine levels change during a woman?s menstrual cycle, which would have complicated the study. Volunteers were presented with sets of two symbols on a computer screen, and were asked to select one. After making a choice, either a smiley face or a frown flashed on the screen, providing positive or negative feedback. The results weren't uniform: symbol 'A' was the most positively reinforced, resulting in a smile 80% of the time, while 'B' was the most negatively reinforced, prompting a frown in 80% of trials. Other characters, C through F, spurred responses somewhere in between. The team next tested whether the volunteers learned to choose symbol 'A' ? indicating learning from positive reinforcement ? and avoid symbol 'B' ? indicating learning by negative reinforcement. Both sets of volunteers learned to choose symbol A. But the men with fewer D2 receptors had trouble learning from the scolding, the team reports today  Science 1 .  \n              Complex decisions \n            Brain imaging confirmed the brain regions thought to be involved in learning from mistakes. A brain area called the rostral cingulate zone was more active in the volunteers with normal D2 levels during the learning sessions, compared to those with the D2 mutation. A brain region key to forming memories, the hippocampus, was also more active in the volunteers with normal D2 levels. It is important to remember that real-life decisions are based on much more than the response of D2 brain receptors, says Ullsperger. But it seems to have some effect on our ability to learn from mistakes. Unravelling how we learn good choices from bad ones will help explain how addiction and compulsive behaviour are processed in the brain, says Michael Frank, a neuroscientist at the University of Arizona in Tucson. The brains of addicts may be tilted against learning from mistakes, says Frank. They're wired to sense the good, such as drug-induced euphoria or a hot streak at the blackjack table, but ignore the losses or consequences. ?It's a recipe for disaster,? he says.

When researchers first discovered a strange new genus of marine worms feasting on whale skeletons on the sea floor 1 , some thought that the creatures had a very specialized habitat and could survive only on the lipid-rich bones of whales. But now it seems that several species of the Osedax worm can dine on cow carcasses as well. Cow bones might not seem like a natural marine food source, but the researchers who made the find say that carcasses from land animals living near the flood plains of coastal rivers sometimes get washed into submarine canyons. And they suspect that the worms might dine on the remains of other marine mammals, too. ?My guess is that we?ll find that these species are quite general in their ability to exploit any bone that they happen to run into,? says Robert Vrijenhoek, an evolutionary biologist at the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute (MBARI) in Moss Landing, California. With no eyes, mouth or stomach, the tiny Osedax worms burrow into decaying bones and rely on symbiotic bacteria to help them break down the fats in the bone marrow. Until now, they have been found growing only on the bones of ?whale falls? ? whale carcasses that have fallen to the sea floor. The worms float about in the water and then settle on suitable substrates such as whale falls to feed and reproduce. How they locate these bony meals ? which can be separated by great distances on the sea floor ? is something of a mystery.  \n              Burial ground \n            Researchers from MBARI and the Scripps Institute of Oceanography in La Jolla, California, planted ?bone trees? made of polyvinyl-chloride (PVC) pipe and cow femurs, and then anchored them in buckets of concrete at varying depths in Monterey Bay, California. After periods ranging from two months to a year, they discovered that six of the eight species present on nearby whale falls were also able to colonize cow bones. In addition, two species were reproducing. The work is published this week in  Proceedings of the Royal Society B 2 . Vrijenhoek, lead author on the paper, says that this ability to feast on a wider range of bones is in line with the high degree of genetic diversity and the immense population sizes of Osedax. ?It just didn?t make sense to me that they could be restricted only to whales,? says Vrijenhoek.  The cow bones clearly aren?t as tasty as whale. Whale bones can support worm densities of thousands per 5-square-centimetre patch; only a handful of worms were found on patches of cow bones, and two species were not found on the cow bones at all. ?I think the findings are really exciting, but we need to be careful in interpreting them,? says Craig Smith, a biological oceanographer at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. Osedax species are likely to have a range of adaptive feeding strategies, Smith says. ?Some of them are likely to be whale-fall specialists, whereas others are likely to be more generalized.? Smith and other researchers have trawled up other marine bones such as dolphins and porpoises with no signs of Osedax.  Both experts agree that what is needed now is to plant bones from other marine mammals such as elephant seals and sea lions, to see how tasty these are to the worms. \n                   NOAA: this whale's (after) life \n                 Reprints and Permissions"},

Physicists and astronomers in the United Kingdom are expressing shock at a plan to slash their budgets and end involvement in a number of programmes. The Science and Technology Facilities Council, which coordinates large-scale facilities and much of Britain?s research in the physical sciences, announced the cuts today. The reductions are part of an effort to make up for a large overspend, with no increase in its budget for 2008?2011. The plan will end Britain?s investment in the International Linear Collider (ILC), a US$7-10 billion particle accelerator. The withdrawal will affect well over 100 physicists, at 16 departments across the country, according to Phil Burrows, a particle physicist at Oxford University. \"The ILC has been identified by the world particle-physics community as the next big thing,\" he says. \"We are sort of devastated.\" And the effect of the cuts is likely to extend beyond the United Kingdom. UK physicists were in charge of developing the electron and positron sources that provide particles to the ILC, according to Jean-Pierre Delahaye, a physicist at CERN, Europe?s particle-physics laboratory in Geneva, Switzerland. They were also taking the lead on a system that would focus the particles into the collider's massive detectors. \"The systems in which the United Kingdom was in charge were essential,\" he says. \"If it is not there anymore, it will be traumatic.\" The plan also calls for cuts in grants. No number has been given, but the cuts are expected to be deep ? around one-quarter of the current figure of roughly \u00a3100 million (US$204 million), according to Michael Rowan-Robinson, president of the Royal Astronomical Society in London. The plan also calls for ending Britain?s funding of high-energy ?-ray research and cutting operating budgets on existing space-based instruments by 30%. \"This will have a catastrophic effect on astronomy departments,\" he says. \"It is just crazy.\"  \n              Concession \n            The council has made one important concession, Rowan-Robinson says. It will seek to retain access to one of the two US Gemini telescopes. Previously, it had said that it would completely withdraw its \u00a34 million commitment to the project (see  UK astronomers stunned by Gemini withdrawal ). Keeping a stake in the northern Gemini telescope, in Hawaii, will allow astronomers to follow up on some of their findings. The cuts are needed to make up for an \u00a380 million cost overrun, in large part by two major facilities ? the Diamond Light Source synchrotron and the ISIS neutron and muon source, both at Rutherford Appleton Laboratory in Oxfordshire. A report released this November from a parliamentary committee found around \u00a360 million in overruns in construction and operating costs at the two facilities, in part due to rising energy costs. The cuts are unfair, says Burrows, because the facilities involved are used by scientists in fields different from those affected by the cuts. \"Particle physics and astronomy are effectively bailing out facilities for other disciplines,\" he says, \"There is a certain sense of injustice.\" Keith Mason, chief executive for the council, says that the cuts had to be made because the budget had not been raised. Cuts to other programmes could follow, he adds. Space science, ground-based astronomy, nuclear physics and gravitational-wave detection will have to be \"tensioned against each other from the available funding,\" he says. \n                   ILC \n                 \n                   Gemini Observatory \n                 \n                   Science and Technology Facilities Council \n                 Reprints and Permissions"},

A whiff of a single type of protein from urine is enough to make a male mouse pick a fight, researchers have found. Pheromone scents that elicit aggressive behaviour have long been predicted, but have proven elusive until now. Male mice will attack other mice they see as a threat, such as males that invade their territory, but will generally welcome females and leave juveniles or castrated males alone. When they do attack it can be quite aggressive. \"The resident will chase the intruder, bite, kick and wrestle with him,\" says Lisa Stowers, a biologist at the Scripps Research Institution in La Jolla, California who along with her colleagues has identified a protein that provokes this aggression. Stowers and her colleagues filtered mouse urine by fractionation to sort the molecules by size. They then tested to see which samples ? when dabbed on a castrated male ? elicited an aggressive response from resident males. The researchers narrowed the search down to a group of molecules called the major urinary proteins (MUPs), whose role in chemical communication has been only suspected until now. MUPs form open ?pockets? like a baseball-catcher's glove, in which smaller molecules nestle. The MUPs were thought to be ?catching? the pheromones in these pockets. But the researchers found that it isn't the small molecules that have an effect on male mice. Displacing the cargo with a different small molecule didn't reduce the MUPs' ability to elicit aggression. And when the researchers digested away the protein mitt, leaving only the small molecules, the solution lost its effect. So the protein alone works as an aggression pheromone, the team reports in  Nature  this week 1 . \"It starts the whole behavioural response in motion,\" Stowers said.  \n              The nose knows \n            Pheromones seem to be detected by a structure called the vomeronasal organ, a tube at the base of the nasal cavity directly behind the nostrils that is filled with sensory neurons (the main olfactory sensor is further back in the nose, and the two systems connect with separate parts of the brain).  When the researchers tagged vomeronasal organs with a fluorescent dye that makes receptors change colour when a molecule locks onto them, and spritzed on some MUPs, only one class of receptor responded. This helped to pin down the mechanism by which the scent is detected.  \"It's very exciting if this is truly a pheromone that is specific to triggering aggressive behaviour,\" says Klaus Miczek who studies the brain chemistry underlying abnormal levels of aggression at Tufts University in Medford, Massachusetts. But he cautions that these MUPs might be more generally to do with social recognition rather than aggression specifically. Miczek says that he would like to see tests spraying female and juvenile intruders with MUPs as well. Both Stowers and Miczek point out that because aggression in humans and mice depends on different triggers, such research probably won?t lead to treatments for abnormal levels of human violence.

And spirit he got, as a pair of ?roadmap cheerleaders? ? a word play on the US National Institutes of Health?s ?roadmap? for medical research ? performed a choreographed tribute to cytoplasm, pom-poms in clutch. The cheerleaders were NIH researchers Clare Waterman and Margaret Gardel. After three grueling days of posters, symposia and networking lunches, the 7,500 attendees of the American Society for Cell Biology meeting in Washington DC (see  conference blog ) were ready for a less cerebral session. Now in its second year, Cell Slam is a lecture on speed. Participants have three minutes to creatively communicate a scientific idea to a rowdy crowd of scientists and a panel of judges. Top honours this year went to Stephen Dahl, a lab safety officer at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, for his ditty Beware of Viral Vectors, sung to the tune of something vaguely resembling  Puff The Magic Dragon . The lyrics refer to a molecular biology trick used to make transgenic cells, as in for gene therapy, sometimes with health consequences. ?Lentiviral vectors are based on HIV, so lentiviral vectors should be handled carefully,? Dahl sang, sneaking an extra syllable or two into every verse.

A study of 39 African cultures has shown that their genetics are closely linked to the songs they sing. Music, it seems, could reveal deeper biological connections between people than characteristics, such as language, that change rapidly when one culture meets another, says Floyd Reed, a population geneticist at the University of Maryland in College Park, who led the study.  \"Other aspects of these populations? cultures have undergone tremendous change, but the music seems to persist,\" he says. \"In a way music is very resilient to cultural change.\" The work, presented late November at the American Anthropological Association?s annual meeting in Washington DC, compares modern genetic data to a catalogue of traditional songs gathered in the 1950s and 1960s by ethnographer Alan Lomax. Lomax, best known for his recordings of American folk music and his popularization of singers such as Woodie Guthrie and Lead Belly, collected some 5,500 songs from 857 cultures. To reveal connections between musical styles, Lomax, who died in 2002, and ethnomusicologist Victor Grauer created a system called cantometrics. This classifies vocal songs based on a sliding scale for 37 traits, such as yodelling and tempo. Victor Grauer, now retired and living in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, wondered whether their cantometric database could be fused with modern genetics. Grauer contacted Sarah Tishkoff, a geneticist at the University of Maryland who studies human diversity. She offered the project to her post-doc, Floyd. ?At first I just dismissed it, I thought 'this is kind of nuts',? Floyd says. But after a night?s sleep he decided it had potential.  \n              Sing along \n            In the 1970s, Luigi Luca Cavalli-Sforza, a geneticist at Stanford University in California, argued that combining genetics with fields such as linguistics and demography could help trace human ancestry. But Cavalli-Sforza hadn't looked at how genes and songs travelled together across cultures. To make this comparison, Floyd crunched through Lomax and Grauer?s catalogue to convert the cantometric database into a two-dimensional scatter plot, with each dot representing a culture. The closer two dots are, the more similar their music. For example, the music of African bushmen cultures, such as the Juhoansi ( listen to Juhoansi audio clip ) , fell close to that of pygmy tribes such as the Aka ( listen to Aka audio clip ). Both include yodelling and a vocal trick called an interlock, in which people sing in tight succession. Further away are styles by groups such as the Hutu ( listen to Hutu audio clip ), who live in central Africa and sing in unison. When Floyd compared the graph with a database of genotypes from more than 3,000 people in Africa, he found a correlation between genes and songs. In other words, cultures that had grouped together musically tended to share genetic markers. The link was stronger than the correlation between songs and geography: cultures next door to each other weren't as likely to sing the same tunes as were cultures with similar genotypes.  \n              Measure that yodel \n            ?This is very cool stuff,? says Erez Lieberman, a mathematical biologist at Harvard University in Cambridge who has analysed the evolution of language using darwinian principles. He cautions that the method for scoring songs is quite subjective, making it difficult to use quantitatively. ?How do you figure out the metrics of what's yodelling and what's not yodelling?? he says. Floyd agrees that it is hard to quantify culture. But he says he thinks that Lomax's cantometrics must tap into something fundamental, since the statistical significance of the link to genetics is so high. Taking an evolutionary perspective on song and language has the power to uncover how cultural traits travel the world, Lieberman adds. Reprints and Permissions"},

Katharine Sanderson reports. For the past three months Joerg Schaefer, a physicist at the University of W\u00fcrzburg in Germany, has been waiting for a group of theoretical spectroscopists to calculate the exact position of gold and platinum atoms in nanowires made from single atoms of the metals. When laid out on a semiconductor surface, the wires could potentially be used to transfer data at high speeds in microprocessors by acting as switches. Once the theoreticians have worked out what combination of metal and semiconductor should produce a wire that can be changed at will from insulator to conductor, Schaefer will try to make that combination in the lab, atom by atom. Theoretical spectroscopy simulates how electrons in molecules behave and can predict what the molecule's spectra will look like. Schaefer can't do the calculations himself, he says, because he doesn't have the necessary tools or knowledge. But he hopes that the theoretical spectroscopists will back up what he is seeing in his lab. ?If everything goes right,? he says, ?the real world and their elusive phantom world will come to the same result.? Schaefer is one of the first clients of the European Theoretical Spectroscopy Facility (ETSF), a network created earlier this year. The network can investigate anything from how the structure of a protein affects its properties to the likely properties of a new material. Established mainly as a service for academic collaboration, its sponsors hope that it will evolve into a service for sale to industry.  \n                Designer tools \n              The network simulates observational tools such as nuclear magnetic resonance, which shows how certain nuclei react to a magnetic field; infrared or Raman spectroscopy, which look at the vibration of molecules; and photoemission spectroscopy, which measures the distribution of electrons in substances. Its supporters say that it will help to save time by predicting what properties new materials or molecules will have before experimentalists try to make them ? a time-consuming process. The facility grew out of Nanoquanta, a similar network funded by the European Commission's Sixth Framework Programme, but focused more on building its own research collaborations than on offering a service to others. Nanoquanta will run to the end of 2008 and is coordinated by Rex Godby from the University of York, UK. Both networks tackle ?the theory and simulation of all sorts of characterization techniques that involve electrons?, says Godby. The ETSF doesn't have a physical home, but it involves about 120 scientists spread across 10 research institutions that are hubs for different spectroscopic techniques. To tap into the network, potential users submit a proposal that outlines their problem. The first call for proposals, earlier this year, attracted 54 submissions from researchers in academia and industry, of which the ETSF says it will back 21. Industrial proposals made up 15% of the submissions. One of these was from Antonio Porro, head of the Centre for Nanomaterials Applications in Construction, a firm run by Labein, a contract research and development company in Bilbao, Spain. Porro is looking at the fine structure of cements, and uses simulations to speed up the process of designing lighter, stronger materials. ?We can cut by half the process of developing a material experimentally,? he says. The industrial bent of the network is mirrored by a shift in its funding as it evolves from Nanoquanta to the ETSF. Nanoquanta's funding comes from the European Commission's research directorate, which is more interested in blue-skies research. The ETSF's main initial funding, however, is being provided by the more industry-linked information society and media directorate, to the tune of ?3.7 million (US$5.4 million).  \n                Service update \n              For now, the network remains very much an academic pursuit. ?The aim is not to make money, it is to provide a service,? says Lucia Reining, a physicist at the \u00c9cole Polytechnique in Paris who is the ETSF's chairwoman. But that could change. From now on the ETSF will ask for proposals every six months, and during the next couple of rounds it wants to gauge the interest from industry. ?We are anxious to discover how much companies are willing to pay,? says Godby. Godby says that the ETSF has no immediate plans to spawn a start-up company: ?It would be wrong for the evolution of the ETSF to be driven by our commercial users,? says Godby. But a spokesman for the information society and media directorate-general says that any of the ETSF's projects that went on to produce a spin-off company would be regarded as a great success. And Porro sees a genuine business opportunity for the venture. The ETSF ?can have a specific commercial aspect?, he says. ?Normally, the materials design process is fully experimental,? Porro says. Being able to predict and validate properties early on is a key aspect of the process, he says, and rigorous theoretical models should help with that. ?This way we can save a huge amount of time and money.? \n                     ETSF \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Veeman took third prize at the American Society for Cell Biology?s (ASCB) third annual 'Celldance' awards (named after the more-famous Sundance film awards), announced late yesterday afternoon.

Twenty-seven entries were judged on their visual appeal, their ability to provide a resource for teaching and the quality of the science.  Honorary mentions included Jan Schmoranzer?s entry ?Cell Portraits?, a somewhat avant-garde film chronicling a day in the life of the postdoc as he arrives at his lab at Columbia University in New York, sets up some microscope slides, heats up lunch, spills coffee, mugs for the camera and finally puts in some microscope time. At one point, a dancer ? Schmoranzer?s colleague Francesca Bartolini ? incongruously pirouettes across the frame. Steve Paddock of the University of Wisconsin, Madison, also received an honourable mention for a video that took a somewhat artistic tack. Sluder calls it ?non-canonical?, as it doesn?t present scientific data, or even a particularly scientific idea, but is visually arresting and fun nonetheless. Paddock?s three-minute film,  Time Flies When You?re Having Fun  , was inspired by a group of school children who came to visit the lab. Developing fly embryos stained with a fluorescent dye float across the screen, interspersed with close-ups of fruitflies.

As delegations from around the world converge this week on Bali, Indonesia, for the latest round of United Nations (UN) climate talks, one thing is increasingly clear: although the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change is indisputably the main venue for such talks, it is by no means the only one. Nor should it be, many experts say. For instance, last week French President Nicolas Sarkozy led a delegation visit to China at which key topics included energy and global warming, and the French nuclear giant Areva walked away with a deal for two nuclear power plants and the possibility of many more in the world's fastest-growing economy. And a week before that, more than a dozen Asian nations, including India and China, signed an agreement to push for clean energy and tackle global warming. There are also coalitions aimed at urging the international community to include tropical-forest protection in whatever treaty succeeds the Kyoto Protocol. And global warming has been a primary focus of at least three international meetings this year ? those of the G8 industrialized countries, the UN and, for the first time, a meeting under the auspices of US President George W. Bush in Washington DC. ?I'm actually not so worried about the treaty negotiations. I think it's much more important to get a small number of countries around a table and work out a game plan in each individual case,? says David Victor, who heads Stanford University's Program on Energy and Sustainable Development. The goal heading into Bali is not to negotiate the treaty itself but to settle on a roadmap for negotiations, with a likely end date of 2009. From this perspective, there simply won't be enough time to work out all of the details at UN meetings. In fact, once the roadmap is set, much of the work on any proposals made could be formulated well in advance of the meetings themselves. ?There's pretty broad agreement that the Framework Convention is the place to cut the grand deal, but that will only happen once the major players reach a stronger consensus,? says Elliot Diringer, director of international strategies at the Pew Center on Global Climate Change in Arlington, Virginia. ?Bilateral contact and other initiatives outside the UN process are key to reaching that consensus,? he adds, as long as everyone keeps their eye on achieving a global treaty. Many advocacy groups bristled when the Bush administration held its meeting of ?major emitters? in September, fearing that it was intended to undercut the UN negotiations. Rob Stavins, an environmental economist at Harvard University, acknowledges there is room for scepticism towards Bush, who has dragged his feet in the international negotiations for years. But bringing nations such as China, India and Brazil to the table with the industrial nations makes sense, he says. ?It's questionable whether there was much that was meaningful in that meeting, but it was the right set of parties around the table.? The developing nations know that their bargaining power stems from fears among Western nations that their own actions to curb greenhouse gases will mean little unless everyone participates. There is also growing scepticism about the ?clean development mechanism?, the Kyoto Protocol's main vehicle for carbon-reducing technology transfer to developing nations. Victor says crafting alternative incentives for nations such as China might prove intractable without a forum that is ?smaller and a lot more flexible? than the UN process. ?My guess is that the Chinese are going to be a whole lot more comfortable in bilateral and multilateral negotiations than under the klieg lights of the UN process,? he says. ?Those kinds of discussions aren't antithetical to Kyoto ? they are just more important. Big treaties almost always follow such negotiations rather than lead them.? John Ashton, a UK climate-change envoy, says debate about venue and process misses the point. Global warming should top every agenda as nations meet in the coming years, but the only venue for resolving the issue is the UN. ?An international treaty is an expression of political will,? he says. ?It's not about the precise architecture of the treaty. There are lots of available policies, and we understand them quite well ? it's the urgency and amplitude with which we apply those policies that's important.? \n                     UN climate conference special \n                   \n                     UN Framework Convention on Climate Change \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

So wrote the chemist and former  Nature  editor John Maddox in 1988 (see  Nature  335,  201 ), who was bemoaning the lack of a computational method to predict how molecules will arrange themselves in the solid state. At present, chemists use X-ray crystallography to determine how atoms are arranged in a molecule and how molecules pack into a crystal. It is a time-consuming method that has remained practically unchanged for almost a century, and it means that experimentalists need to produce a high-quality crystal. Software that could predict the three-dimensional structure of compounds could allow the properties of materials, or potential drug candidates, to be examined and the different possible molecular configurations to be screened in advance, before they are made experimentally. The problem has been attacked head-on by the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre (CCDC) in Britain. Every three years since 1999, the centre has set a challenge for software developers to predict the structure of four molecules, the structure of which was known only to the CCDC. But nobody had been able to predict the correct structures of all four molecules. This year saw a breakthrough. A team consisting of Frank Leusen and John Kendrick of the University of Bradford, UK, and Marcus Neumann of Avant-garde Materials Simulation in Saint-Germain-en-Laye, France, correctly predicted the structure of all four molecules. ?We have made a big step forward,? says Leusen. The 15 teams performing this year's test were each given a sketch of four molecules that showed all the atoms present and some details about how they were crystallized. These were all unpublished small organic molecules, of between 8 and 33 atoms. From this starting point, the teams ran calculations about the possible positions of the atoms and molecules within a crystal. In most branches of chemistry, it is not enough to know a molecule's formula. For instance, to predict a compound's solubility, colour or how it will be taken up by the body, chemists need to know how the molecules align in a crystal. Even the smallest compound may have hundreds of thousands of possible arrangements of its molecules in a solid crystal. The structure depends on the energies of the atoms both within and between the molecules; and also on the relative positions of the atoms and molecules. The structure that scientists try to predict is the one with the lowest value for these energies: the most stable configuration. ?Modelling the growth of a crystal is a daunting thing,? says the CCDC's Graeme Day. ?The main problem is when the molecule has options for its own shape as well as for how it packs.? Finding the most stable structure is especially important in the pharmaceutical industry. If one crystal arrangement, or polymorph, is overlooked, and it happens to be more soluble than the others, then a patient could end up taking a greater dose of a drug than is needed. And because patents are granted for a specific polymorph, companies risk being gazumped if they don't know the entire range possible. The winning predictive method used a new approach. ?We took a route that is different from everyone else,? says Neumann, who wrote the program that the team used. The team added a quantum mechanical round of calculations in between two sets of the more usual classical simulations. The first molecular-mechanics step screens the possible energies of the crystals and ranks them in order of stability. The new step then calculates a force field of the bond energies for the most stable configurations, which helps to whittle down the original list of possible structure candidates to the most likely 100 or so. ?Now we can do this additional refinement that re-ranks the structures,? says Leusen. Finally, this re-ranked list goes through another round of molecular-mechanical calculations based on the lattice energy and stability of the molecule.  \n                Flexible functions \n              And the system worked, even for the trickiest test. Day had thrown into the test a co-crystal of two molecules, as well as a compound that was long and floppy. ?In the first three tests we had no successes for flexible compounds,? says Day. But in this year's test, three teams got it right. ?This is very welcome news,? says David Baker, at the University of Washington in Seattle, who works on predicting the structure of proteins. But he cautions that the technique isn't necessarily applicable to larger molecules such as proteins because of the computing power needed to perform quantum calculations on large systems. Even very small proteins have hundreds of atoms ? insulin, for instance, has nearly 800. And the largest proteins can have hundreds of thousands of atoms. Neumann says that at the moment their technique will work for only 5% of the molecules that are useful for the pharmaceutical industry. The next goal is use the structure to accurately predict a crystal's properties, he says. Maddox greeted the achievement with enthusiasm. The problem of structure prediction ?stuck out like a sore thumb? 20 years ago, he says. But he isn't surprised that it has taken so long to crack. ?Science doesn't necessarily move at the speed of jets.? \n                     Nature chemistry portal \n                   \n                     Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre \n                   \n                     Avant-garde Materials Simulation \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Researchers have managed to restore heart function by transplanting muscle stem cells into damaged mouse hearts. Their results suggest that the technique could one day be used to heal heart tissue in humans. Similar transplants have been tried before in both mice and humans, but have met with little success. Although the grafts sometimes improved the function of the heart, they also raised the risk of abnormally fast heartbeats, in a disorder called ventricular tachycardia. Ventricular tachycardia is the main cause of sudden death in patients who have had a heart attack, killing about 15% of patients within three years of their attack.  ?It?s an enormous clinical problem that is clearly unsatisfactorily treated by our available tools,? says Richard Lee, a researcher and cardiologist at Brigham and Women?s Hospital in Boston, Massachusetts. ?A great number of things that we?ve tried to do to suppress arrhythmias in humans have instead caused them.? Heart attacks in humans are typically caused by a gradual loss of blood flow that slowly starves cardiac cells of nutrients. As the cells die, heart function declines.  Researchers have long hunted for a way to either prevent or reverse the effects of heart failure by replacing the damaged heart cells. Early results showed that injecting injured regions of the heart with skeletal-muscle stem cells or even bone-marrow cells could restore some function.  Exactly how this works is unclear: some say that the muscle stem cells contract just like heart-muscle cells, helping the heart to beat. Others propose that the transplanted cells stiffen the cardiac wall, or perhaps secrete compounds that aid neighbouring, functional cardiac muscle cells. Whatever they do, one thing is clear: both cell types sometimes improve the heart?s ability to beat, but they also disrupt its beating rhythm.  \n              Blending in \n            So Michael Kotlikoff of Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, and Bernd Fleischmann of the University of Bonn in Germany, and their colleagues, tried to transplant a different type of cell, called embryonic cardiac-muscle cells. These cells, they found, coupled physically with the surrounding heart tissue and could exchange electrical signals with their new neighbours ? signals that are used to keep a heart beating in time. The result was a well-behaved heart, they report in  Nature 1 . Relatively few transplanted cells were required to get the effect. So why were the embryonic cells better at blending in with their surroundings than the adult muscle cells? The researchers thought one explanation might be that both embryonic cells and adult heart cells have higher expression of a protein called connexin 43, which is important for forming connections between cells. Connexin 43 is expressed at lower levels in adult muscle stem cells. To test whether connexin 43 was indeed the key factor, they team tried using adult muscle stem cells that had been forced to express the protein. This produced similarly good results. ?If you make these cells express connexin 43, they correct or reverse the vulnerability to arrhythmia,? says Kotlikoff. This could liberate future researchers from relying on embryonic tissue, which can be more difficult to acquire.  The technique will have to surmount a number of technical hurdles before it can be used as therapy. ?It?s very exciting to have a new concept like this, but one has to be extremely cautious about where it?s going to go clinically,? says Lee. ?Arrhythmia has been particularly vexing. We have really a lot of experience with things that look like they will help in animals, but when we get them into humans they don?t.? Kotlikoff notes that the team has evaluated performance of the transplants for only about two weeks ? not long enough to ascertain whether the grafts will be stable in the long term. And the damaged heart tissue in their mice was concentrated in a specific region of the heart, unlike the mosaic of live and dead cells found in human hearts. \n                   Nature Clinical Practice Cardiovascular Medicine Stem Cell Supplement \n                 \n                   Nature Insight: The heart \n                 \n                   Nature Insight: Stem cells \n                 \n                   Nature Reports Stem Cells \n                 \n                   NIH: Can stem cells repair a damaged heart? \n                 \n                   NIH: What is an arrhythmia? \n                 \n                   World Health Organization: Cardiovascular disease \n                 Reprints and Permissions"},

There was something strangely familiar about results published in two high-profile chemistry journals recently: as one researcher has since pointed out, they accidentally replicated an experiment that was done more than a century ago. The resulting ruckus has highlighted how accidental chemical conclusions can get past peer review, and stands as a reminder of how easy it is to miss similarities to old results. The results were those from two groups who claimed to have made an unusual organic compound: a 12-membered nitrogen-containing ring of a class of molecules called annulenes. This chunky compound, they said, would have special properties and could be useful as a surfactant, among other things. One paper was published in 2006 1 ; the second builds on it, and was published this year 2 . But when Manfred Christl, a chemist at the University of W\u00a3rzburg, read the papers he recognized the reaction conditions as those used some 103 years earlier by German chemist Theodor Zincke, in a reaction that took his name 3 . That reaction creates a salt half as big as the claimed annulene ring (the annulene ring is a ?dimer? or double-molecule version of the monomer salt).  Christl got in touch with the authors to let them know his thoughts. Since then, Isao Yamaguchi, at Shimane University, Japan, and colleagues have retracted their work in  Organic Letters 4 . ?I reflect that I lacked a knowledge about the reaction pointed out by Dr Christl,? says Yamaguchi. Fredric Menger at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia, and colleagues say a correction will be published for their paper, published in  Angewandte Chemie  in August. In Menger?s case, the mistake arose partly because of an effect that happens with mass spectrometry (MS) ? a technique used to determine the mass of a molecule. ?Our MS mass was twice that of the monomer because, apparently, dimers form in the gas phase of the mass spectrometer, a point that we did not realize at the time,? says Menger. Christl's own notes are also published in  Angewandte Chemie 5 .  \n              Whoops \n            It is not unusual for scientists to retract results. The most recent, high-profile case in chemistry was in March 2006, when Dalibor Sames, a chemist at Columbia University, New York, retracted six full papers because a number of results about C?H bonds produced by one of his graduate students could not be reproduced.  But the Menger/Yamaguchi case highlights another problem ? lack of knowledge of old literature.  ?We are so reliant on electronic databases nowadays, I bet there are many current students that have no idea that the print version of  Chemical Abstracts  [a database of all chemical reactions ever published] even exists,? says Michael Haley, a chemist at the University of Oregon, Eugene. ?It?s good for older folk to point out to us young punks that ?you need to do your homework better?,? he says. ?I am sure this happens a lot and is probably becoming increasingly common as we fail to keep up with the literature,? agrees Andrew Holmes of Melbourne University, Australia, who worked with annulenes as a graduate student and was forced to retract a paper of his own in 1996 after being unable to reproduce results.  Christl also criticizes the peer-review process that let both Yamaguchi's and Menger's papers be published in the first place; he bemoans the lack of time that people have to do a thorough job. ?Reading the literature is a luxury that not many respected scientists can allow themselves anymore,? he says.  Haley sees this episode as a useful warning to scientists: ?referees need to do their job and examine manuscripts carefully,? he says. ?It?s a good call to arms, a warning sign.?  Menger adds there is much in his paper that is correct and useful; the theoretical work on the structure of 12-membered annulene is still valid and the compounds he made are still useful surfactants, he notes. His research will not be affected, he says, except ?we will probably be more careful in the future combing the ancient literature.? \n                   Nature's chemistry portal \n                 Reprints and Permissions"},

The UK government will back the construction of a new, state-of-the-art medical research centre in central London, the Medical Research Council (MRC) announced today.

MRC Chief Executive Sir Leszek Borysiewicz said in a press release that the new UK Centre for Medical Research and Innovation, in this prime location that is closer to clinical facilities than the present NIMR site, ?will be of crucial importance to the UK?s plans to ensure that medical research findings are turned into benefits for patients and the economy as efficiently as possible.?

Microbiologists in the United States are expressing concern about a government proposal to limit research on several plant pathogens because of their potential to be used as bioweapons. The researchers say that the plan to subject rice and citrus disease agents to the same restrictions as Ebola virus and anthrax are ill-conceived and will limit the response to a natural outbreak. The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) plans to add four plant pathogens to the government's list of 'select agents'. Created to keep infectious diseases out of the hands of would-be terrorists, the current list includes 81 human, animal and plant pathogens and toxins. Researchers studying substances included on the list must confine their work to high security labs, file mountains of paperwork and submit to background checks. The latest draft includes pathogens of rice, citrus, rye and deciduous trees that have wreaked havoc elsewhere, but have not crossed US borders. The USDA is accepting public comment on the proposal until 3 December. Many scientists think that plant diseases should not be lumped with deadly human pathogens such as smallpox. Most plant-disease research is already subject to strict regulation and quarantine, they point out. Adding more plant diseases to the select-agent list could have a chilling effect on research, says Jan Leach, a microbiologist at Colorado State University in Fort Collins, who studies  Xanthomonas oryzae , a bacterium that causes leaf blight of rice. ?Some of us will just drop out. We won't work on those pathogens anymore,? she says. Her lab halted research on one strain after it was added to the list. But if the proposed changes go forward, all strains would be subject to the extra regulations. The disease ? endemic in Asia and Africa ? poses minimal threat to the United States because of different climate and farming techniques, she says. In Florida, the select-agent law stymied the state's response to a 2005 outbreak of citrus greening, says Wayne Dixon, a senior plant pathologist at Florida's agriculture department in Gainesville. Now, the USDA plans to remove from the list one strain that is widespread in Florida, while adding another that is currently hitting orange trees in Brazil. Dixon worries that if the Brazilian strain hits Florida, research and epidemiology will again be handcuffed by the disease's select-agent status. For example, researchers who perform lab tests on potentially infected tree samples must destroy them if the sample reveals a positive result. Michael Firko, a USDA official who was involved in drawing up the new select-agent list, says the agency attempts to balance national security with scientific freedom by updating the list biennially and seeking input from researchers. He cites the delisting of plum and soya bean diseases in 2005 and the current proposal to remove one strain of citrus greening. Yet for many plant pathologists, these changes don't happen often enough or fast enough. ?We had our hands tied for two years,? says Dixon.\n \n                     Agricultural Select Agents \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Brazilian president Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva's playful admonishment to his science minister came after the president's announcement last week of a remarkable US$28-billion package for science and technology over the next three years. The spending promised is equivalent to 1.5% of the country's GDP ? currently, science receives about 1% of GDP. The investment is part of a federal plan to improve academic research and to counter the lack of technological innovation in the industrial sector, which is a special cause of concern. Most researchers in Brazil are still employed in the public sector, which has helped to energize the academic community, with the number of scientific publications increasing by around 9% a year since 2000. Now, 2% of the world's scientific publications are Brazilian ? ranking it 15th in the world. But despite this, the private sector is losing out because of an absence of qualified researchers. Brazil is responsible for just 0.1% of all the patents registered globally each year, according to a 2007 report by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. To address this, the government's new science plan includes extensive grants and tax breaks for research projects conducted by private companies. Funding for postgraduate qualifications will also continue to increase to expand the still insufficient scientific workforce, particularly in key fields including biofuels, nuclear technology, climate change and Amazon-related studies. The new plan also includes measures to reduce bureaucracy and excessive legislation. Although the scientific community supports the measures, many researchers remain sceptical. Some fear that the still-evident cogs of bureaucracy will block a lot of funding before it can be spent usefully. ?There was a period where projects would be approved, funding would be allocated, and then the money never came ? nobody would get anything, it was surreal,? says Luiz Eug\u00e1nio Mello, head of the Brazilian Society of Experimental Biology. ?That memory is still very fresh. But overall, the plan has good intentions and good ideas.? A common complaint concerns the heavy taxation and regulatory control over imports of research equipment. ?A European researcher who needs a product can get it the next day. Here we wait three to six months for it,? Mello says. ?There's no way we can be competitive like that.? No surprise then that the most warmly applauded moment during Lula's speech last week came when he vowed to streamline the import of scientific instruments.

Documents released under the Freedom of Information Act raise questions about how the US Department of Energy (DOE) oversees investigations of misconduct at its science facilities. During such oversight, government officials do not always retain records of the investigations, it has emerged. DOE officials overseeing an investigation into alleged misconduct at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee approved the investigatory panel's findings at a meeting that government officials left without keeping copies of key investigative records. This is according to a 13 November ruling by attorneys at the DOE ? issued in response to a Freedom of Information Act request by this reporter. The story begins in March 2006, when a reviewer for the journal  Nature Physics  alleged that a manuscript submitted by Oak Ridge researchers in the group headed by electron microscopist Stephen Pennycook contained inappropriately manipulated data. An investigation panel convened by the lab's deputy director for science and technology, James Roberto, exonerated Pennycook and others of wrongdoing in July 2006, but other scientists expressed doubts (see  Nature 444, 129; 2006 ). In January this year, the DOE said that Oak Ridge, which is run by the not-for-profit company UT-Battelle under a 5-year, US$6.3-billion contract, had reopened the investigation. ?Once again, the committee concluded there was no evidence of misconduct,? an Oak Ridge spokesman told  Nature . According to the November ruling, DOE officials approved this first finding at a meeting last year with lab officials where they were shown copies of a panel's investigation report in binders marked ?do not duplicate?, and reviewed the process that the panel used to arrive at its finding of ?no misconduct?. The lab officials then took the binders back, the ruling says. It adds that although the DOE officials felt that it was ?very important? to confirm the panel was objective and composed of people who did not work at Oak Ridge, they apparently did not keep a record of who those investigators were. Last week, Oak Ridge named Paul Peercy of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and David Williams of the University of Alabama in Huntsville, as two panel members. ?Copies of the report were returned as is normal practice with confidential documents,? says Oak Ridge's spokesman, Mike Bradley. ?Department of Energy officials were not at any time restricted from access to the report,? he adds. The freedom-of-information ruling cites a standard clause in the contract between the DOE and UT-Battelle as evidence that the company ?clearly intended to retain control over the report of investigation?. That clause says that records relating to investigations ?conducted under an expectation of confidentiality? will be considered the contractor's property. In 2005, Raymond Orbach, director of the DOE Office of Science widened the clause to cover misconduct reports from all US national labs run by the DOE. In the Oak Ridge case, the DOE did later receive a copy of the investigation report, which the recent ruling orders Orbach's office to consider for public release ? overruling his deputy, Patricia Dehmer, who had refused to do so. But Oak Ridge says that it was sent not for oversight but ?for informational purposes only?. ?Can a government agency fulfil its oversight responsibilities with this degree of access?? asks C. K. Gunsalus, an attorney and misconduct expert at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. She says that other science-funding agencies employ oversight experts who routinely receive and retain not only investigation reports, but the data at issue and the names of people involved, and analyse these in detail ? a process that for a complex case might well take longer than one meeting. Bioethicist Arthur Caplan of the University of Pennsylviania, Philadelphia, says he can't understand why the DOE introduced a rule relinquishing control of investigation reports. ?Why would they give up supervisory powers?? he asks. Officials in Orbach's office plan to meet this week to discuss the matter. \n                     13 November ruling \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has produced four massive assessments of climate-change science since 1990. Its efforts culminated this year in a summary report that many argue delivers solid answers to the biggest questions ? whether and to what extent humans are contributing to global warming ? while laying a strong foundation for dealing with the possible dangers and finding potential solutions. Now, some are beginning to argue, it's time for the IPCC to change gear and alter the way it works.  In a policy forum piece published today in  Science 1 , two scientists argue that the IPCC must become a nimbler body if it is to remain relevant in the coming years.  Until now, the IPCC has produced a set of reports over the course of a year once every five or six years. But waiting until 2012 for another summary report isn't an option, argues Frank Raes, a climate scientist with the European Commission?s Institute for Environment and Sustainability in Ispra, Italy, and one of two authors on the  Science  commentary. ?We cannot wait another five, seven years for an assessment,? he says. ?We have to act.? Action, he argues, will require swifter input from the IPCC. \"It?s an open debate, and this is the right time to have it really,\" says Peter Cox, a climate modeller with the Met Office at the University of Exeter, UK. \"In some sense, we?ve taken step one of the IPCC path, which is to demonstrate that climate change is an issue and that it?s due to human activities.\" Step two, Cox says, is to reorganize the process ?from end to end? around adaptation and mitigation. \"Rather than just elucidating the climate problem, it?s got to be more focused on solutions.\" IPCC chairman Rajendra Pachauri is currently circulating a paper discussing the panel's future and raising questions about structural reforms - including whether there should be more targeted assessments or fewer comprehensive assessments. He says he personally sees no need for major changes. Major assessments on the order of five or six years will remain useful, he says, while IPCC can respond to demand from policy makers with targeted assessments as needed. ?We definitely need a larger social science dimension,? he says, as well as more analysis of economic impacts of adaptation and mitigation. ?That?s my personal view, but I will be guided by what governments want.?  \n              Quick answers \n            Raes and colleague Rob Swart, who manages the European Topic Centre on Air and Climate Change in Bilthoven, the Netherlands, suggest that the IPCC consider the United Nations' acid-rain programme as a model. The Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution, which covers Europe and North America, went through an initial period of broad assessments on the science itself, Raes says, and then entered a second stage that has brought together industry, environmentalists and policy-makers to address specific policy questions. Raes and Swart suggest that the IPCC do something similar. Although it would remain a purely scientific body that doesn't give policy advice, it could shift to providing specific information driven by policy questions. This might involve a reorganization of the panel. The IPCC currently has one working group that assesses the basic science of global warming, a second working on risks and adaptation, and a third analysing mitigation options. That system could continue to provide broad assessments on a longer timeline, Raes says, but policy questions about how to treat biofuels and deforestation require a more integrated approach. Martin Parry, who co-chairs the IPCC's second working group, says there is broad acknowledgement that faster, targeted assessments will be needed. But he adds that there is still a role for a body that produces broad scientific assessments independent of the policy process. ?I?m somewhat skeptical of integrated assessments,? Parry says. ?There?s something to be said for keeping the science assessment clean and at a distance [from policy].?  \n              Special reports \n            Few people question the idea that the IPCC will need to adjust its sights, but some say a drastic overhaul of the organization might not be necessary. Leonard Bernstein, an author of the fourth synthesis report issued in Valencia, Spain, earlier this month, said the IPCC already has a model for this in the way it handles ?special reports? on specific topics such as carbon sequestration and renewable energies.  ?If you use the special report model, it?s not even a matter of adapting the IPCC,? Bernstein says, adding that special reports are interdisciplinary and can be issued within a couple of years. ?That would make the process quicker, more flexible and more integrated because these reports do cover policy, economics and technology.? The IPCC could also shift its timing, such that one of the working groups releases a report every two years, as opposed to all three releasing simultaneous reports, says Cox. He says such a system would allow each group to build on the latest work done by the other groups, and would naturally encourage scientists in each group to help those currently working on a report. Pachauri says he hopes the IPCC's future can be discussed and ultimately settled when the panel meets in April 2008, so the new leadership has a \"clear mandate\" when it takes office in September 2008. \n                   Convention on Long-range Transboundary Air Pollution \n                 \n                   Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change \n                 Reprints and Permissions"},

Researchers have worked out the neurological trick used by a species of wasp to turn cockroaches into 'zombie slaves'. The discovery explains why, once stung, cockroaches can be led by a much smaller master towards certain death. Researchers have proven their theory by replicating the effect, and by using an antidote injection to release the cockroaches from their zombie state. Zombie insects might sound like the B-movie plot device from heaven (or hell, depending on your cinematic preferences). But to the emerald cockroach wasp ( Ampulex compressa ), they're a tried and tested way to provide food for their hungry larvae. The wasp, which lives in tropical regions of Africa, India and the Pacific Islands, relies on cockroaches for its grisly life cycle. But unlike many venomous predators, which paralyse their victims before eating them or dragging them back to their lair, the wasp's sting leaves the cockroach able to walk, but unable to initiate its own movement. The wasp then grabs the cockroach's antenna and leads it back to the nest. The cockroach walks \"like a dog on a leash\", says Frederic Libersat of Ben-Gurion University of the Negev in Israel, who led the research and has previously described the wasps' behaviour in detail. Once home, the merciless wasp lays an egg on the docile cockroach's belly, and the larva, once hatched, devours the hapless insect (see video  Wasp voodoo rituals and cockroach zombies in the French Polynesian Islands ).  \n              Toxic cocktail \n            But although the zombie cockroach phenomenon has been well documented, Libersat and his colleagues still didn't know how exactly the wasps pull off the trick. \"We know the wasp injects a rich cocktail of toxins,\" Libersat says. But it was unclear how the venom could alter the victims' behaviour so subtly. The researchers knew that the wasps tend to sting the cockroaches once to subdue them, then adminster another, more precise sting right into their victim's brain. So they suspected that the venom might work by blocking a key chemical messenger.  The results of their latest experiment, published in the  Journal of Experimental Biology 1 , support that theory. The researchers report that the venom works to block a neurotransmitter called octopamine, which is involved in preparations to execute complex behaviours such as walking. Libersat and his team found that they could restore spontaneous walking behaviour in stung cockroaches by giving them a compound that reactivates octopamine receptors in the insects' central nervous system. This, they conclude, means that the wasp venom probably blocks these receptors. What's more, the researchers discovered that injecting unstung cockroaches with a compound that blocks these receptors produced a similar effect to that of the venom. \n                   Evolution news  \n                 \n                   Ecology news  \n                 \n                   Brain and behaviour news \n                 \n                   More on venom  \n                 \n                   Video of wasp attacking cockroach \n                 Reprints and Permissions"},

Brendan Maher talks to him about the diagnosis, and the ghoulish hobby of posthumous study. Scientists have long speculated about the health of the sixteenth American president Abraham Lincoln, whose long, lanky features were reminiscent of the genetic disorder Marfan syndrome, and whose melancholy hinted of depression. Now, John Sotos of Palo Alto, a cardiologist, rare-disease hobbyist (and consultant for the television series House M.D.), has thrown his hat in the ring with a new book 1  and a new diagnosis: a rare, cancer-causing genetic disorder called MEN2B.  \n              Q. So why did this diagnosis take so long to bring to light? \n            The theory that Lincoln had Marfan syndrome was proposed in 1962. It became a white-hot debate for a few years and then it sort of cooled off. It heated up a little bit again when the Marfan gene was discovered in the early 1990s 2 . But what I learned is that all that heat and light was generated on really an amazingly thin examination of the Lincoln historical record.  \n              Q. How did you arrive at this diagnosis? \n            I didn?t really do anything specific about Lincoln until the summer of 2006. Then two things happened. First, a friend of mine told me that a new Marfan-like syndrome had been discovered called Loeys-Dietz syndrome 3 . And Loeys-Dietz had this unusual finding of a bifid uvula [a cleft in the soft palate at the back of the mouth].  That was fine. But about six months later I was reading this random book that had been on my bookshelf for years about the civil war and it mentioned that Lincoln?s fourth son, Tad, had a cleft palate. Cleft palate and bifid uvula are really the same thing. They are just different points on the spectrum of a possible single disorder. So, I did a few weeks of research, and became more and more convinced that Lincoln had Loeys-Dietz syndrome, and then I talked to [Johns Hopkins geneticist Hal] Dietz about it, and became less convinced. So, at this point I thought well, I?m not going to worry about this anymore, I?ve wasted enough time on it. What I?ll do is collect the notes that I have in a little self-published book so that the next guy who tries this won?t have to repeat all the work I did.  So, I just worked on that sort of accumulation of facts for the book, and then one night a light bulb sort of went on. I was reading a different article entirely and it made me think of medullary thyroid carcinoma which is associated with marfanoid habidis [overgrowth of bones resulting in long limbs] in a syndrome known as MEN2B. And I thought, well, maybe I?ll just check out MEN2B in Lincoln and see if that?s a match.  \n              Q. How rare is MEN2B? \n            There have been no numbers that I?ve seen on what the exact prevalence is, but it?s probably about one in a million. I?ve never seen a patient with this disease and most physicians have never seen a patient with this disease.  \n              Q. What symptoms does it cause? \n            Overgrowth of bones. And then there?s overgrowth of neurally derived cells. The benign overgrowth produces neuromas, which are little balls of proliferated nerves that accumulate in mucosal tissues sort of like knots in wood. It turns out that Lincoln had a characteristic sign of this. He had a big lower lip that was asymmetric and bumpy. One of the lumps on Lincoln?s lips is on the five dollar bill. The other place you get neuronal proliferation is in the gut. So people become constipated. They also become flatulent. We don?t know anything about Lincoln?s flatulence, but we do know he was constipated, and a couple of his law partners would apparently talk about this.  \n              Q. It also causes malignant growth. Does that cause a serious type of cancer? \n            The two characteristic cancers of MEN2B are medullary thyroid carcinoma and pheochromocytoma. So, what I think was going on was that Lincoln had medullary thyroid carcinoma for a number of years. Lincoln was 56 when he was shot, which is pretty old for someone with this disease, and that?s the greatest challenge for the diagnosis. There are cases in the literature of people with metastatic medullary thyroid carcinoma where people live for 15, 20, 25 years without treatment. It?s an unusual beast in that regard.  \n              Q. This didn?t turn up in autopsy (though it was pretty clear that it was a bullet that killed him). What?s the evidence that he had cancer? \n            Visitors to the White House frequently spoke of how thin he looked. Then in his last three months his health turned for the worse. He was almost continuously ill in one way or another and my suspicion ? and I won?t go so far as to say my diagnosis ? but it is suspicious that he had three symptoms of pheochromocytoma during this time: headache, orthostatic syncope [he would faint when standing up] and cold, clammy hands and feet, which he complained to a friend about. In fact, this friend saw Lincoln put his feet so close to the fire that they steamed.  \n              Q. Could this diagnosis be checked, theoretically? \n            Yes. 95% of the people who have MEN2B have the same single codon variant and this is something that is routinely tested for today.  \n              Q. Will it be checked? \n            Access to Lincoln's body is impossible. After a grave-robbing attempt years after his death, his son reburied Lincoln in an 8 cubic foot block of concrete encased in iron bars. So nobody is getting to him except with a bomb.  There are all kinds of biological materials floating around though that would have his DNA in it. Those with the best claim to be authentic are a few fragments of his skull that were left over in the autopsy instruments and are now owned by the Department of Defense. There are also a lot of blood stained artifacts around? There?s really no shortage of Lincoln DNA that?s above ground. The trick is getting people to release samples.  \n              Q. Your book,  \n             The Physical Lincoln, \n             is self-published. Why? \n            I sent an article manuscript to some medical journals to publish. It entered into peer review at one medical journal and it was rejected because I didn?t have room enough in the paper to make a case that Lincoln was marfanoid; that is somewhat in dispute in the literature.  And to make the case for MEN2B it was just impossible for me just to condense it down. I realized that to convince people of all the evidence for this theory it would take more space than a journal would permit me to have.  \n              Q. Do you have any interests in trying to diagnose other public figures? \n            That?s a landmine. I do, but I don?t think I want to talk about it. He?s in office and he?s very powerful?

Are there pea-sized objects as heavy as the Moon out there in space? Perhaps so, if quarks, the constituent particles of atoms, are themselves made up of still smaller particles. Fredrik Sandin and Johan Hansson of Lule\u00a3 University of Technology in Sweden say that these hypothetical particles, called preons, might exist in super-dense chunks left over from the beginning of the Universe. Their work predicts that these heavy objects should be detectable with current astronomical techniques 1 . This helps to turn a highly speculative hypothesis into a testable idea. If preon nuggets exist, they might account for a significant proportion of the mysterious dark matter known to make up a big chunk of the tangible mass of the Universe.  \n              Smaller and smaller \n            It?s been long known that matter has a Russian-doll nature. Atoms are made of protons and neutrons (together called hadrons), along with lighter electrons. In turn, hadrons consist of particles called quarks, of which there are six varieties. In addition, there are six varieties of fundamental particles related to the electron, called leptons. In 1974, physicists Jogesh Pati and Abdus Salam speculated that a small family of particles they called preons could explain the proliferation of quarks and leptons. In 1999, Hansson and his coworkers proposed that three types of preons would suffice to build all the known quarks and leptons 2 3 . Then in 2005, Hansson and his student Sandin went on to explore whether some matter could have got stuck at the preon stage, rather than ?condensing? into quarks or hadrons 4 . They predict that it could. Such lumps of preons would be even denser than quark stars or neutron stars. Neutron stars, for comparison, are thought to compact the mass of our Sun into a ball the width of Long Island in New York.  \n              Big bubbles \n            The lumps of preon matter they envisage wouldn't be made from collapsed stars, but would be relics from the Big Bang. As the newborn Universe expanded, the matter it contained gradually thinned out, switching from preon matter to quark matter and eventually to the atoms that now make up stars and interstellar gas. Sandin and Hansson say, however, that some of the preon matter might have got stuck as stable bubbles that never made the switch. They calculate that these bubbles would be less massive than ordinary stars, at no more than 100 times the mass of Earth, and less than a metre across. There?s no lower limit, but Sandin and Hansson have considered preon nuggets down to the size of a pea, which would be a little less massive than the Moon. Such objects, scattered sparsely through space, would be too small to see directly. But the researchers say that there are various ways they might reveal themselves.  \n              Heavy bending \n            Such ultra-dense objects would bend light that passed nearby. This effect is called gravitational lensing: the objects acts as a kind of lens for the light of more distant stars that lie behind it when viewed from Earth. Gravitational lensing is well known for visible light bent by large, dark objects. But Sandin and Hansson say that, because preon nuggets are so small, they would exert their strongest influence on ?-rays, such as those emitted from extremely violent cosmic outbursts called ?-ray bursts. The preon lenses wouldn?t brighten the ?-ray signal, as a normal gravitational lens does, but would produce a characteristic wobble in the spectra.  Another approach could spot two preon nuggets bound in mutual orbit by gravity. Such ?binaries? would emit gravity waves ? ripples in space-time, which could be detected with gravity-wave detectors if the binary is near the Sun. Diminutive preon binaries would excite waves of high frequency, making them detectable by table-top devices rather than the immense gravity-wave detectors currently used to search for such waves from star-sized objects. And tiny preon nuggets that collide with Earth would excite seismic waves that can be identified by seismic detectors. ?They?re so small, they would just drill a hole through the planet?, says Hansson. But they would leave a trail of seismic waves along their path, which, being a straight line, would clearly differ from the rumbles created by the grinding of continents.  \n              Shot in the dark \n            Making preon matter seems to be out of the question: it would involve recreating the conditions of the early Big Bang, before the putative switch to quark matter. That would require energies way beyond the reach even of the Large Hadron Collider, which is now nearing completion at Europe's particle-physics laboratory, CERN, near Geneva in Switzerland.  How do other physicists react to the notion of preon stars ? quite literally a shot in the dark? ?They?re either very enthusiastic, or they think it?s rubbish?, says Hansson. ?There?s not much in between.? But John Charap, a theoretical physicist at Queen Mary College in London, seems to sit in the middle ground. ?It?s not a completely daft idea?, he says. ?And after all, we need some pretty daft ideas to make any progress in understanding dark matter. We?re currently floundering around looking for ways to explain it.

A precise topographical map has been made of one of the flattest places on Earth: the salar de Uyuni, a vast plain of white cemented salt in the mountains of Bolivia. The ground survey, aided by global positioning systems (GPS), shows variations in elevation of less than a metre across an area almost half the size of Wales. Intriguingly, the work reveals bumps in the salt that lie above lumps of dense rock buried several kilometres below, just as water will bulge over a bump on the ocean floor. Knowing exactly where these bumps lie will help researchers to use the flat as a giant calibration device for satellite-based radar and laser altimeters. Adrian Borsa, a geophysicist at the US Geological Survey in Pasadena, California, led the work that is now reporting the most precise GPS characterization yet of the salt flat, accurate to 2.2 centimetres. Borsa and his colleagues began the research in 2002, with a campaign that combined data from fixed GPS stations with ?kinematic GPS? data obtained by crisscrossing the salar in trucks fitted with GPS antennae. ?It?s as if you?re on a white ocean with no waves,? says Borsa. ?You see the horizon, the curvature of Earth. It?s absolutely featureless.? The study was commissioned specifically as a way to calibrate NASA?s ICESat, launched in 2003 to study ice sheets in Antarctica and Greenland. Satellites can calibrate their altimeters by bouncing signals off the ocean surface, the height of which is well established. But because of atmospheric interference, tides and waves, there are uncertainties. Borsa says the salar, now so accurately mapped and with dry, clear skies, is about five times better than the ocean as a reference point. The results have been helpful, says Sinead Farrell, a researcher at the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration who is using ICESat to measure changes in sea ice. ?It?s the first calibration surface that we look at,? she says. ?The information that they provide is useful to all the other teams.? She adds that the salt flat is also being used for Envisat, a European satellite, and could be used to calibrate future orbiters such as Cryosat-2, a planned European ice-monitoring mission.  \n              Not so flat \n            Whereas the Earth-observing community likes the flatness of the salar, geologists are interested in the tiny undulations.  The strength of gravity varies from place to place around Earth ? imperceptibly to humans but in ways that scientists have mapped precisely ? owing to the density of objects nearby. Borsa found that the salt had created faint mounds of some 40 centimetres in height over regions of slightly higher gravity, owing to high-density volcanic rocks kilometres below. ?We found a rare breed of topography,? says Borsa, who says that this is the first time a land surface has been shown to undulate in step with the gravitational field like this. ?Here?s a place where you see the imprint of the gravitational field due to buried mountain ranges.? Borsa has a theory as to how this happened. When the salar floods, as it does every five years or so, salt dissolves and, in solution, flows to regions of higher gravity, he says. This phenomenon is already known to oceanographers: the free-standing ocean surface changes slightly to match the pull of gravity underneath. So there are slight bulges in the ocean in places directly above submarine seamounts. ?We know that ocean surfaces follow the gravitational potential surface: the geoid,? says Farrell, who was not a part of the study. ?It is a new result to show that the salt flat also follows the geoid.?  The next step for those with a geological interest, Borsa says, is to take out the portion of the elevation variations that are due to gravity and see what?s left. So far, he is seeing a strange, regularly patterned checkerboard surface. He doesn?t know what could produce it, but speculates that it could reflect the imprint of periodic pressures due to prevailing winds. Working out the forces that produce this pattern could be useful if similar phenomena are ever spotted on another planet, he says. ?Now we?ve got an analogue on Earth.? \n                   ICESat Website \n                 \n                   Envisat Website \n                 Reprints and Permissions"},

Shinya Yamanaka of Kyoto University in Japan has followed the announcement last week of his startling success in turning human skin cells to embryo-like stem cells, by reporting that he has done the same without the cancer-causing agent used in his original recipe. The work brings scientists perhaps one step closer to the goal of being to use patient-matched stem cells for therapy. Yamanaka first demonstrated his method for ?reprogramming? cells in mice. Last year he showed that he could produce pluripotent cells ? cells that can turn into any of the roughly 220 cell types in the body ? by using retroviruses to carry four genes into mouse skin cells 1 . The four genes reprogrammed the mouse cells to a state similar to those in the early embryo. He named the cells induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells. But one of those genes, c-myc, is known as an oncogene, which can cause cancer. When Yamanaka produced live mice from embryos injected with these pluripotent cells, 20% of them developed tumours. When last week Yamanaka reported similar success using human cells 2 , the announcement was tempered by the fact that such cells, made using c-myc, would pose a danger to transplant recipients. In the further work published by  Nature Biotechnology  today 3 , Yamanaka shows that he can make both human and mouse iPS cells with just three factors, without using c-myc. Last week James Thomson of the University of Wisconsin in Madison and his colleagues also reported a success with four factors that did not include c-myc 4 . But Thomson's result needs further work. He created his pluripotent cells using fetal not adult cells, whereas medical applications will require that adult cells be used. And Thomson's method has not tested in mice, he says. \"We've tested these cells in mice and we know they are safe,\" says Yamanaka. Before any pluripotent cells will be ready for use in human transplant therapies, however, much more work needs to be done. To reduce risks to recipients, the introduced genes may have to be eliminated altogether, perhaps by simulating their function with a small molecule, or the genes will have to be introduced in a way that does not require viral vectors. \n                   Nature reports stem cells  \n                 Reprints and Permissions"},

A particularly cunning seven-year-old chimp named Ayumu has bested university students at a game of memory. He and two other young chimps recalled the placement of numbers flashed onto a computer screen faster and more accurately than humans. ?It?s a very simple fact: chimpanzees are better than us ? at this task,? says Tetsuro Matsuzawa, a primatologist at Kyoto University in Japan who led the study. The work doesn't mean that chimps are 'smarter' than humans, but rather they seem to be better at memorizing a snapshot view of their surroundings ? whether that be numbers on a screen or ripe figs dangling from a tree. Humans may have lost this capacity in exchange for gaining the brainpower to understand language and complex symbols, says Matsuzawa. \n              Quick as a flash \n            Two decades have passed since Matsuzawa?s team first taught a female chimp, Ai, to recognize and order Arabic numerals 1 . Later, he and Nobuyuki Kawai trained her to memorize the location of numbers as they flashed onto a computer screen. The numbers would be quickly covered with white squares, and Ai could then touch those squares in order of the numbers concealed beneath them 2 . After much training, chimps can be remarkably good at this task (see  video , in real time). Matsuzawa and Sana Inoue went on to train three pairs of mother chimps and their infants to recognize and remember numerals, as Ai had done. The kids outmatched their mothers most of the time, and Ai's son Ayumu was head of the class, they report today in  Current Biology . 3 When Ayumu went head-to-head against university students in the game, he made them look like dunces. This was most noticeable when the numbers appeared on the screen for just two tenths of a second - too brief for humans to get a good grip on them. Here, Ayumu correctly ordered the numbers in 80% of trials, while the students scored an average of just 40% (see  video ).  It's unclear how long Ayumu?s memory of the number placement lasts after seeing them flash on the screen. When a sound across the room caught his attention, he paused in the middle of a game for ten seconds before finishing the puzzle (see  video ). Matsuzawa plans to test how much longer chimps can remember the numbers.  \n              Mental trade-off \n            Could the chimps' superiority come from simply having had more practice? Ayumu had been playing the game throughout his seven years of life, and got a treat after each run. But the researchers think this practice wasn't Ayumu's only advantage. ?We trained university students for six months and their accuracy did not reach this level,? says Matsuzawa. He suggests that humans made a mental trade-off as they diverged from their common ancestor with chimps some 5 to 6 million years ago. In gaining brawnier brains that can process language and other complex symbols, we may have dulled our ability to take quick mental snapshots.  To find that chimps are better than humans at some specific tasks is not surprising, says Michael Beran, a psychologist at Georgia State University in Atlanta. Chimps and humans are in some ways very similar, he points out. The key to uncovering a chimpanzee's inner Einstein is to put them to the right kind of test, he says. There are limits, however. ?I work with some pretty smart chimps, but they're not going to do your calculus homework,? says Beran. \n                   Chimpanzee Special \n                 \n                   More chimpanzee videos \n                 Reprints and Permissions"},

A skin cream that can hyperactivate the body's natural DNA repair mechanisms has been shown to protect mice from skin cancer, and to reduce the growth of cancers already present. If the compound does the same for humans, it could one day be added to sunscreen as a cancer-fighting ingredient. The active component of the cream, called CP-31398, works by reactivating disabled forms of a natural tumour-suppressing protein called p53. Nicknamed ?the guardian of the genome?, p53 controls several important cellular functions, including the repair of damaged DNA, cell division and a genetically encoded auto-destruct pathway called apoptosis that kills unhealthy cells. The p53 gene is mutated in over half of all human cancers. For that reason, pharmaceutical companies have been hunting compounds that can protect or restore p53 activity, in the hope that these might prevent or treat cancer. In 1999, researchers at Pfizer showed that CP-31398 restores normal activity to mutated p53 proteins in cell cultures (although how exactly it works is a mystery) 1 . Mohammad Athar, a biochemist at the University of Alabama in Birmingham, went on to test the compound in live animals. Athar and his colleagues slathered the compound onto the skin of hairless mice, and then exposed the mice to ultraviolet (UV) light twice a week for 35 weeks. At the end of the experiment, mice treated with CP-31398 had seven tumours on average; control mice that did not receive the drug had 16.  The tumours that did grow on treated mice were roughly a sixth the size of tumours in control mice. And, Athar and his colleagues found, the compound slowed the growth of preexisting skin tumours. The results are published this week in the  Journal of Clinical Investigation 2 .  \n              Repair cream \n            ?I think the results of this preclinical study look promising,? says Wafik El-Deiry, a cancer biologist at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine in Philadelphia. ?If the compound survives subsequent testing it could be used as an additive to sunscreen.?  CP-31398 is not the first skin treatment that has been shown to repair cellular damage from sun exposure. Lotion containing fragments of DNA can ward off precancerous skin lesions in mice (see  DNA-boosted sunscreen may fight cancer ), and a salve containing a DNA repair protein reduces the number of skin tumours in people with a genetic defect in this DNA repair system. One important next step will be to compare how the cancer-fighting properties of CP-31398 compare not only to these experimental alternatives but also to the UV-blocking properties already in sunscreens, El-Deiry says.  And before CP-31398 can be used in humans, it will have to be tested for safety and efficacy. Athar says that he has not observed negative side effects of the drug in mice, but previous work suggests that too much p53 can cause premature ageing (see  Cancer-proof mice age prematurely ). CP-31398 restores mutant p53 proteins to their normal function, but it is not yet clear whether the drug boosts p53 activity beyond that found in a typical cell. Athar says that so far his lab has found no evidence that CP-31398 enhances p53 activity beyond normal levels.  It is also not clear whether CP-31398 will be active against other forms of cancer. Different cancer-causing agents generate different kinds of mutant p53, Athar notes. Whether CP-31398 can correct more than just damage due to UV light remains to be seen. \n                   Nature Insight: Signalling in Cancer \n                 \n                   Nature Insight: Cell Division and Cancer \n                 \n                   Nature Collection: Cancer Genomics \n                 \n                   Dissect Medicine \n                 \n                   Nature Medicine blog \n                 \n                   National Cancer Institute: Skin cancer \n                 \n                   Comparative Toxicogenomics Database: CP-31398 \n                 \n                   The Journal of Clinical Investigation \n                 Reprints and Permissions"},

In 1981,  Nature  published a review about the possible link between high levels of dietary ?-carotene and reduced rates of cancer. The article came with an unusual message from the editor running along the bottom of the first page. ?Caution,? the note read. ?Unwary readers (if such there are) should not take the accompanying article as a sign that the consumption of large quantities of carrots (or other major dietary sources of ?-carotene) is necessarily protective against cancer.? 1 The review highlighted promising epidemiological studies, but referred repeatedly to the need for clinical trials. In 1994, the results of those trials were in: ?-carotene supplements, given together with vitamin E, did not protect against lung cancer as epidemiological studies had suggested they might. Instead, the supplements may actually have raised risk of developing the disease for male smokers 2 .   That kind of scientific about-turn, so common in nutritional research, is often blamed for spreading dietary confusion. A new study has found that just as the public continues spend millions each year on ?-carotene supplements, some scientists also eschew the clinical-trial data ? which in this case are generally held to be more trustworthy ? and instead continue to perpetuate the original observational findings.  \n              Selective memory \n            These findings were paralleled in two other examples in which observational studies and randomized clinical-trial data clashed: the notion that vitamin E might protect against cardiovascular disease, and that oestrogen might increase the risk of developing Alzheimer?s disease. Some journal articles continued to cite the original studies long after the clinical trials were published.  ?Across all topics, no matter whether you look early or late after the contradiction, there is a section of the scientific literature that continues to pretty strongly support the original claims,? says John Ioannidis, an epidemiologist at the University of Ioannina School of Medicine in Greece, and an author on the study published in the  Journal of the American Medical Association 3 . Epidemiological studies that look for an observed link between nutrition and disease are obviously useful in generating testable hypotheses. But they are also potentially misleading. The studies benefit from easy data collection, but are subject to confounding factors and are generally unable to establish a causative relationship. ?I would not say one should not listen to observational studies. They?re a starting point; they give hints about what to pursue further,? says Ioannidis. ?But I would not take it for granted that they are the truth.?  \n              Hard to let go \n            Ioannidis and his colleagues traced the literature in these three chosen case studies where clinical trials were known to have upset early epidemiology. In all three cases, there was a decline in the number of citations of the early observational work once the contradicting clinical trial data was published. But many authors continued to favour the early observational data. This was most pronounced in ?-carotene studies in which, over a decade after the clinical trial data were published, some authors referenced the observational data without even mentioning the clinical trial results.  In the other two cases, authors who favourably cited the observational data also referenced the clinical-trial data, but then provided reasons for why they discounted the clinical-trial results. In evaluating the link between vitamin E and cardiovascular disease, for example, some challenged the form of vitamin E administered in the trials; others speculated that the trials needed to have run for longer before the benefits would become apparent. Similar arguments were made in some articles about the effects of hormone-replacement therapy on the risk of Alzheimer?s disease.  While some of these criticisms provide valid starting points for future research, others simply don?t hold up, says Edgar Miller, an epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland, and lead author of an analysis of clinical-trial data that found a link between vitamin E supplements and slightly higher death rates. ?Some of these counter-arguments muddy the waters,? he says.  \n              Wishful thinking \n            Why then do some scientists prefer the earlier data? Ioannidis speculates that this is sometimes due to ?wish bias?. ?People have been pursuing a line of research and they just don?t want to believe that they have followed a path that is incorrect,? he says. ?That?s not a nice feeling. It's like defending your baby.? But Jan Vandenbroucke, an epidemiologist at the Leiden University Medical Centre in the Netherlands cautions that it may be too soon to draw conclusions about bias. Ioannidis and his colleagues should enlist the help of experts in each field to determine how much merit there is in arguments that favor observational research, he says. Some delay is to be expected before clinical-trial data percolates through the culture, he adds: \"It takes some time to turn around a scientific community.\" \n                   Dissect Medicine \n                 \n                   Nature Medicine blog \n                 \n                   Journal of the American Medical Association \n                 \n                   John Ioannidis \n                 \n                   National Institutes of Health Vitamin A fact sheet \n                 Reprints and Permissions"},

Deforestation issues must be included in global talks on carbon-emissions control, experts say. European companies seeking to offset their greenhouse-gas emissions under the Kyoto Protocol are pumping billions of dollars into clean-energy projects in the developing world. But the protocol does not include funding initiatives to prevent deforestation, which is responsible for some 20% of global carbon emissions. Eyeing an economic opportunity that could put money in the hands of those who preserve native forests rather than chop them down, tropical countries are now banding together to alter the rules after the Kyoto accord expires in 2012. The first step is to ensure that deforestation is on the agenda at Bali, Indonesia, where international negotiators will gather next week for the latest round of United Nations climate-change talks. ?All of the big countries [with tropical forests] have gotten together to tell the world that they support the same fundamental idea,? says Doug Boucher, who works on the issue for the Union of Concerned Scientists, an environmental watchdog based in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Boucher points out that Indonesia has become an international leader on the issue despite being virtually absent from the debate just six months ago. ?We may look back on this in a couple of years as having been a turning point,? he says. The idea that deforestation must be addressed in any cohesive response to global warming is not new. Although reforestation projects were allowed during the Kyoto deliberations a decade ago, the question of halting deforestation was dropped, largely because of technical questions. How does one verify a decline in deforestation? And how can anyone be sure that the problem hasn't just moved elsewhere? A decade after the Kyoto talks, advocates say the issue is ready to take the stage in Bali. Advances in aerial and satellite monitoring should help in answering the first question, and the tropical nations have developed various policy solutions to the second. Costa Rica and Papua New Guinea led the Coalition for Rainforest Nations in a proposal to revive the question at the climate talks in Montreal in 2005. Recently, Indonesia has joined Brazil and other major countries in the 'Forestry 11' coalition, which includes 11 nations representing some 85% of the world's tropical forests, according to the Union of Concerned Scientists. The proposals vary, but all tend to focus on verified emissions reductions, as opposed to upfront payments on projects intended to achieve certain targets. The Coalition for Rainforest Nations, for instance, proposes that deforestation be tracked on a national level, with carbon credits being sold only after a decrease in national emissions in that sector had been verified. Although these nations have not endorsed a single idea, Boucher says, they are united in their efforts to ensure that deforestation has a clear place on the agenda for post-Kyoto deliberations. ?Deforestation is front and centre,? says Steve Ruddell of Forecon, a consultancy based in New York that works on carbon markets and forestry issues. ?It's still not a done deal, by any means, but I think the time is right.? \n                     UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change \n                   \n                     UN Framework Convention on Climate Change \n                   \n                     Union of Concerned Scientists \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Those were the qualities that the Ray and Maria Stata Center at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) was meant to embody, according to an MIT statement at the time of its dedication in 2004. Now it also embodies a spirit of leakiness. ?When I was an undergraduate visiting the lab, I thought that all the random buckets and X marks on the carpet must be for some high-tech rover experiment,? says student Shuonan Dong. ?When I became a graduate student, I realized that the buckets were just buckets, to collect rain.? In October, MIT sued the building's architect and a contractor over ?design and construction failures? in the building, which houses the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, among other things. The architect involved is no run-of-the-mill designer, but one of the world's most renowned ? Frank Gehry, creator of such monuments as the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao in Spain and the Walt Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles. Gehry is unimpressed with the suit: ?MIT is trying to use it to get a million and a half in insurance money,? he says. ?If there are leaks, I am sure they are fixable. The staff and faculty who use the building love it. They are not complaining.? In fact, some are complaining. But the leaks are not their only, or even their most pressing, complaint. There are scientists who object to the way their new surroundings seek to shape their work and even their ideas. One irritation is the building's internal openness. According to Gil Alterovitz, a researcher affiliate working in bioinformatics: ?It was picked to be a design showcase, but for the researchers, maybe they don't want to be on display. Everyone can see what you're doing, and there is a sign that has been up for a year or two that says 'don't tap on the glass, we feel like fish'.? Although the Stata building is unique in some respects (what other lab has a fa\u00e7ade that resembles ?a party of drunken robots?, in the words of no less a critic than the architect himself), in its enforcement of transparency it is part of a trend among scientific buildings seeking architectural prestige. Openness has become something of an architectural obsession. At London's Natural History Museum, for example, the new Darwin Centre buildings expose curators to visitors through high glass walls. And the response is not uniformly favourable. At the inward-looking aquarium of the James H. Clark Center at Stanford University, researchers put posters up on the glass to get some privacy, says Kenneth Kornberg, who runs an architecture firm in California and Tokyo that specializes in research space. For a new building given to ? or imposed on ? existing faculty, an architectural concept embodying a specific attitude to research can be a problem. But with a new building for a new institution, it can be a way of setting the agenda. Janelia Farm, the new flagship lab for the Howard Hughes Medical Institute outside Washington DC, is ?based on randomness and the opportunity for interactivity?, according to its architect Rafael Vi\u00f1oly. Its labs are glass-walled. The verdant lawns on its flat roofs seem to go on for ever (and the fact that local deer plunged off the edges when the building first opened testifies to the power of the illusion). Bob McGhee, who helped design Janelia Farm, knows that those open, glass-walled labs can turn people off. But this is part of the point. ?The facility helps you decide which kind of people will really work there,? he says. It becomes a way for potential faculty to feel out whether they are ready for the kind of culture the team behind Janelia Farm wants to create. Janelia's communality is built into the design in other ways, too: the site gives pride of place to that great interactive crucible of scientific breakthroughs, a pub. Architecture has always been used to make statements about what science is and how it should be done. Peter Galison, a historian of science at Harvard University, has traced the evolution of physical laboratory space from the temples of learning inhabited by pre-war ?gentlemen physicists? through the factory-like spaces of the Second World War and beyond into today's more eclectic styles. The buildings, he says, reveal how their makers see scientists, and scientists inside the buildings take cues from the buildings when thinking about themselves. These cues are not always imposed from outside. Take the central building at Fermilab in Batavia, Illinois, which the lab's director Robert Wilson wanted to be ?a soaring centralized monument,? says Galison, ?not a bunch of sprawling tin shacks?. Wilson wanted a grandeur to match that of the lab's undertakings in fundamental physics. Fermilab's distinctly flashy Wilson Hall, as it was eventually named, was an exception in the 1970s. But various factors are now at work to promote a greater role in lab architecture for striking designs and the big-name architects who provide them. One is the role of large-scale philanthropy. Private donors are often more excited by the idea of a concrete-and-steel artwork masterminded by a celebrity in wire-framed specs than by cookie-cutter lab space. It speaks to the importance and contemporaneity of the science they are funding. Another factor may be a broader sense of what an academic is. ?Scientists now move in different circles,? says Galison. ?They are all moving back and forth between basic and applied science. They don't see themselves as part of a corps of employees.? And so you start to see buildings with all the extras ? carpets, wooden banisters, art. These buildings ?try to be places where people other than scientists are going to be comfortable, like venture capitalists and people starting companies?, Galison says. And then there are quite specific issues. McGhee explains that, when designing Janelia Farm, he realized how 'dry' lab space ? desks with computers ? is supplanting traditional wet lab space, with its complex plumbing and ventilation requirements. Wet labs are creatures unto themselves, and not all architects are experienced in designing them. Sometimes this problem is solved by splitting up the job ? a famous architect will design the shell and another firm will design the lab space. One such building is the Buck Institute for Age Research in Novato, California (see  page 603 ). I. M. Pei, a comparatively rare example of a big-name architect who has worked on several scientific buildings, including the iconic National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colorado, designed the travertine exterior, with its floating staircases. Kornberg and his company worked on the interiors, an arrangement that in general he is not necessarily sold on. ?That hybrid does not always produce the best buildings,? he says. ?Would you have one architect do the shell and another design the interior of your house?? The move towards greater dry lab space increases the possibilities for involving non-specialist architects in lab building, and for flexibility in the buildings themselves. Gehry thinks that people working in the Stata building who don't like it should alter their environments as they see fit. ?I was trying to give them the body language of a building that wasn't precious, so they could push and kick and nail into it,? he says. Vi\u00f1oly's attitude that ?the building should be like an instrument, like the equipment the scientists use?, also bespeaks flexibility ? as problems and mindsets change, so architecture should be willing to change with them. But there will always be room for disgruntlement ? and delight. Now a graduate student, Dong sings the praises of the Stata. ?I love the open space, and I love the Dr Seuss style. Many of my friends work in practical buildings with a grid-like layout, where it never rains indoors. But my oh my, how boring that must be!?\n Additional reporting by Heidi Ledford and Jennifer Meyer. \n                     Editor in the Field ?

Failure to test patients with tuberculosis for drug-resistant strains may have spurred the development of a deadly antibiotic-resistant outbreak, researchers have found.  The work suggests that if better tuberculosis surveillance programmes had been in place during the past decade in developing countries, antibiotic treatments could have been better tailored to patients, and the emergence of extensively drug-resistant strains of tuberculosis (XDR-TB) could have been delayed. ?The main message to any public health programme anywhere in the world is that you cannot control infectious disease without a surveillance programme,? says Willem Sturm, a doctor and microbiologist at the University of KwaZulu-Natal in South Africa and an author on the study.  XDR-TB is a lethal descendant of the multidrug-resistant strains of tuberculosis that emerged in the 1990s. Whereas multidrug-resistant strains are resistant to the two antibiotics that have traditionally been used as a first line of defence, XDR-TB is resistant to both the first-line antibiotics and at least three of the six remaining second-line drugs. The resulting infection is incredibly hard to treat. XDR-TB was first seen in patients with HIV in KwaZulu-Natal in 2005 (see  Extreme TB strain threatens HIV victims worldwide ). Since then, the strains have been found across the globe, in patients with and without HIV. Almost 10% of cases of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis are now believed to be XDR-TB 1 . Models have predicted that without improved control of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, the XDR-TB outbreak will become an uncontrollable epidemic 2 . ?Between HIV and TB ? not only in Africa but in parts of India and China ? there are going to be so many deaths that it will change the shape of those societies,? says Michael Iseman, a doctor at the University of Colorado School of Medicine in Denver, who was not affiliated with the study.  \n              Cocktail \n            Doctors have tried to suppress the emergence of drug-resistant tuberculosis by treating patients with multiple antibiotics. The use of several drugs is expected to drastically slow the development of resistant strains because simultaneously developing resistance to more than one drug should be a very rare event. But this only works if the infection in question is susceptible to a number of drugs in the treatment cocktail. Now, a survey of drug resistance in tuberculosis cultures taken from infected patients between 1994 and 2005 shows that strains found more than a decade ago in the KwaZulu-Natal province were already resistant to several of the antibiotics being used to treat the disease 3 . ?People were treated with four drugs, but two to three of them didn?t work because the organism was already resistant,? says Sturm. If South African officials had known that, they could have switched the treatment of such patients to a set of four drugs that did work against the dominant strains, says Sturm. Instead, they effectively treated the infections with a single drug, so the local tuberculosis became resistant to that too, generating XDR-TB. The spread of HIV in the region provided an increasing population of particularly susceptible patients, worsening the problem.  \n              Culture test \n            Many countries in the developing world cannot afford to routinely test tuberculosis cultures, and diagnosis is often based solely on microscopic examination of sputum taken from patients. ?They have no laboratory services,? says Iseman. ?If the smear is positive they treat the patient.? South Africa is rich enough and has the labs, says Sturm. ?It was not a matter of resources in South Africa. It was a matter of priorities.?  Sturm says that when he was in charge of laboratory services for KwaZulu-Natal in the early 1990s, he instituted a surveillance programme in two regions of the province. But in 1995, this programme stopped, he says. ?It was considered a waste of money,? says Sturm. ?At that time, we stopped doing any susceptibility testing. We were treating patients with a blindfold on.? With the emergence of XDR-TB, doctors in KwaZulu-Natal now need to perform drug susceptibility tests on all of their patients. ?So we are now financially much worse off then we would have been if we had implemented surveillance in 1995,? says Sturm.  The results have implications for all infectious disease programmes, from malaria to HIV, says Sturm. \"The main point is that we must learn to prioritize surveillance.\" \n                   Nature Tuberculosis Special \n                 \n                   Web Focus: Antimicrobials \n                 \n                   Dissect Medicine \n                 \n                   WHO Tuberculosis Fact Sheet \n                 Reprints and Permissions"},

Drugs that mimics the health-protection effects of a chemical compound in red wine could form the basis of the next generation of treatment for diabetes. An extract of red wine, resveratrol, is known to temper the damage done by fatty diets, helping to extend healthy life and battle fat-related disease. But tests in mice have suggested that gallons of vino or a super-sized pill would be necessary for humans to stand a chance of getting the same benefits. Now scientists have discovered several chemicals that mimic resveratrol but have positive effects at more modest doses. The drugs have already been shown to do as well as another type 2 diabetes treatment in rodent tests of the disease, and will soon be tested in people. The drugs could be an alternative to diabetes treatments such as Avandia (rosiglitazone) that lower blood sugar but have caused heart problems for some (see  Weighing up the evidence ).  \n              Metabolic switch \n            In mice, resveratrol reverses the toll of gluttony, keeping their livers healthy and insulin down. Scientists think this effect is thanks to the compound?s ability to activate a protein that affects metabolism ? called Sirt1. To confirm this, and to search for a more potent pharmaceutical, Christoph Westphal, a biologist and CEO of Sirtris Pharmaceuticals in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and his team went looking for other compounds that rev up Sirt1. After sifting through half a million chemicals, the group found several that activate Sirt1 at much lower doses than resveratrol does. One of the compounds, SRT1720, is about a thousand times more potent in biochemical tests. Westphal?s team gave a small dose of SRT1720 to fattened-up mice, and the rodents? blood sugar fell compared with fat mice not given a drug. The drug matched a proven type 2 diabetes treatment in restoring insulin sensitivity in the obese animals. SRT1720 also lowered blood sugar in two other rodent models used to test diabetes drugs, they report today in  Nature . Resveratrol also fights diabetes by restoring insulin sensitivity, but it took at least five times more of it than SRT1720 to do the job. SRT1720 has few side effects on the mice, perhaps because Sirt1 and its cousins ? called Sirtuins ? are turned on naturally when animals diet, says Westphal. ?When you calorie restrict and exercise your Sirtuin levels go up, and no one's telling you that's unsafe,? he says.  \n              Beyond diabetes \n            Clinical safety trials for SRT1720 as a diabetes drug are set to begin in the first half of 2008. There?s no assurance that it will prove safe and effective in people, says Guilo Pasinetti, a biologist at Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York. ?The acid test is always to move on to humans,\" he says.  Westphal?s team is also eyeing other conditions that it might be useful for. The effects of boosting Sirt1 aren?t limited to diet, says Leonard Guarente, a biologist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, who consults for Sirtris Pharmaceuticals. Activating the protein could help stave off the cellular damage that causes other diseases that come with age, such as cancer, Alzheimer's and heart disease. ?One wants to believe that this target is broader than just metabolic diseases,? he says. ?In the perfect world the target would be all diseases of ageing.? \n                   Sirtris Pharmaceuticals \n                 Reprints and Permissions"},

The power needs of Europe, the Middle Eastand North Africa could be met by an ambitious idea to network renewable energies across the region. The cornerstone of the plan, developed by a group of scientists, economists and businessmen,involves peppering the Sahara Desert with solar thermal power plants, then transmitting the electricity through massive grids. Prince Hassan bin Talal of Jordan was scheduled to present this green-energy idea, dubbed DESERTEC, to members of the European Parliament in Brussels on 28 November. The vision is ambitious: it would require roughly 1,000 100-megawatt power plants, using mirrors to concentrate energy from the Sun's rays, throughout the Middle East and North Africa to meet the region's projected energy needs. A high-efficiency electricity grid, yet to be built, would then ferry the power around and across the Mediterranean Sea and northern Europe. \"The technology for the DESERTEC concept is available and can offer unlimited, cheap and carbon-dioxide-free energy to Europe,\" says Gerhard Knies, a retired physicist based in Hamburg, Germany. Knies is co-founder of the Trans-Mediterranean Renewable Energy Cooperation (TREC), which came up with the DESERTEC idea. The European Union has a binding target to get 20% of its energy from renewable sources by 2020, so the idea is gaining support in some areas. \"It makes a lot of sense to profit from the high amount of solar radiation in the deserts,\" says Robert Pitz-Paal, head of the solar research department at the German aerospace agency DLR. But with a price tag of almost ?400 billion (US$595 billion), it remains to be seen if DESERTEC will be adopted politically. \"Unless it's extremely cheap, it won't stop people using easy-to-get fossil fuels,\" says Jon Gibbins, an energy engineer at Imperial College London. \"We didn't stop using coal in the last century because of oil.\" Nationalistic concerns may also be a stumbling block, with European politicians reluctant to be dependent on Africa. For instance, Hermann Scheer, a member of the German parliament, is in favour of renewable-energy approaches, but is pushing for European energy autonomy through small, decentralized power plants on European soil. The vision of covering the Sahara with solar panels to generate electricity for Europe goes back to Frank Shuman, a Philadelphia-based inventor who built a prototype solar thermal plant in Egypt in 1913. But the idea never took off, and today solar power in the region comes from relatively small solar-cell installations on houses and other individual buildings. In 2003, Knies co-founded TREC and began presenting the idea at conferences. He eventually got the attention of the German environment ministry, which has commissioned three technical studies to evaluate the concept. Germany aims to get 50% of its energy from renewable sources by 2050, and is a leader in developing solar thermal power. \"The ministry was interested in knowing if it's feasible to import solar energy from North Africa and to penetrate the market there,\" says Ralf Christmann, an officer at the ministry. The DESERTEC scenario foresees a mix of renewable energies, from wind to geothermal to biomass power (see  map ). But the core is solar thermal power, which uses solar energy stored in a special heat-retaining fluid to drive a turbine and create power. First demonstrated in 1982 with a 10-megawatt plant in California's Mojave Desert, solar thermal plants can now produce electricity at a cost of about 15-20 eurocents per kilowatt-hour. According to the DLR, further improvements in technology and scale could bring that down to less than 10 eurocents per kilowatt-hour, making it more competitive with coal. Initial solar thermal plants are being planned in Algeria, Egypt and Morocco, with more under construction in Spain and Italy.  Bringing electricity from Africa to Europe presents another challenge. The DLR says that ?45 billion of the overall budget should be invested by 2050 to place high-voltage d.c. transmission cables throughout the region. Such a line already exists between Norway and the Netherlands. The DESERTEC group is asking parliamentarians to set up a ?10-billion fund to finance the development of solar thermal plants over the next 7 years, and to establish a political framework for the idea. But although the project may not take off on the scale its supporters hope for soon, solar thermal power could still pick up elsewhere. \"Right now, 1,000 megawatts of solar thermal energy are being built in California and Nevada deserts, and we are planning an additional 5,000 megawatts,\" says Dan Kammen, director of the Renewable and Appropriate Energy Laboratory at the University of California, Berkeley. \"Exploiting solar energy from deserts is a good idea worldwide.\"  \n                   Energy for a cool planet web focus \n                 \n                   Nature insight into materials for clean energy \n                 \n                   Solar thermal overview \n                 \n                   European Commission-Energy for a Changing World \n                 \n                   Trans-Mediterranean Renewable Energy Cooperation (TREC)  \n                 \n                   International Energy Agency collaborative program SolarPACES  \n                 Reprints and Permissions"},

Heidi Ledford reports on the resurrection of interleukin-1 blockers. In 1977, researchers isolated a novel protein from human blood that had been exposed to a pathogenic bacterium. Some called the protein a pyrogen because it triggered fever; others called it an activating factor for its ability to stimulate white blood cells. It also damaged joints and influenced liver proteins. Many were sceptical that it was just one protein. ?People didn't believe that a single molecule could do all these things,? says Charles Dinarello, an immunologist at the University of Colorado at Denver and one of the first to study the protein, which was eventually called interleukin-1. ?I was ridiculed quite a bit.? Thirty years later these arguments are long settled, but the list of functions for interleukin-1 continues to grow. It is now blamed for destroying insulin-producing cells in diabetics and triggering inflammation in Alzheimer's disease. Inhibitors of interleukin-1 are credited with easing the symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis and gout, and alleviating a serious hereditary inflammatory disease. So it is hardly surprising that the protein is attracting the attention of companies ranging from Swiss pharmaceutical giant Novartis to pharmaceutical antibody developer Xoma, in Berkeley, California, which has just 300 employees. But while the potential market for interleukin-1 blockers now looks bright, many of these companies abandoned previous interleukin-1 programmes years ago. ?The drug companies more or less gave up on interleukin-1,? says J\u00fcrg Tschopp, an immunologist at the University of Lausanne, Switzerland. ?But recently, every drug company I know has reactivated their programme.? That may be because drug firms see a pressing need for additional anti-inflammatory therapies. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as aspirin and COX-2 inhibitors come with unwanted side effects, including gastrointestinal bleeding and, in the case of some COX-2 inhibitors, an increased risk of heart attack and stroke. Another class of anti-inflammatory drugs inhibits the inflammation-inducing protein tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-?). These inhibitors are prescribed to treat chronic inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease. Sales of the top three TNF-? inhibitors reached US$10 billion in 2006. But TNF-? inhibitors also heighten the risk of opportunistic infections, and simply don't work for some patients, including up to 30% of those with rheumatoid arthritis. ?Everybody has focused on TNF-? for the past ten years,? says Raymond Dionne, a pharmacologist at the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) in Bethesda, Maryland. ?A lot of people swear by it, but really wish that something else was available.?  \n                Left on the shelf \n              It was the TNF-? inhibitors that silenced interleukin-1 research programmes nearly a decade ago. Amgen, a biotechnology company headquartered in Thousand Oaks, California, inherited an early formulation of an interleukin-1 inhibitor when it bought a smaller biotech company. Amgen would eventually shape that drug into Kineret (anakinra) ? the only interleukin-1 inhibitor currently on the market. But by the time Amgen turned its attention to Kineret, TNF-? inhibitors were showing promise, says rheumatologist Alan Solinger, who oversaw Amgen's clinical trials for both Kineret and the company's TNF-? blocker Enbrel (etanercept) when he worked for the company. He is now vice-president of clinical immunology at Xoma. ?The predecessor to Kineret sat on the shelves for about four years before Amgen realized it had an asset that could be developed,? says Solinger. ?By then, the TNF agents had already moved ahead.? Kineret is a recombinant form of a protein naturally produced by the body to keep interleukin-1 in check by preventing it binding to its receptor. Clinical trials showed that the drug performed well against rheumatoid arthritis and caused no side effects. But Kineret requires a daily injection and it is not an ideal interleukin-1 blocker. ?This drug is very short lived,? says Tschopp. ?You inject it and it's gone.? Trials showed that TNF-? inhibitors outperformed Kineret in treating rheumatoid arthritis, but some say that this comparison unfairly weakened the general case for interleukin-1 blockers. ?Enbrel and the others were excellent TNF blockers, but Kineret was not as good an interleukin-1 blocker,? says Solinger. ?Everybody moved over to the TNF bandwagon, including Amgen.? The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Kineret in November 2001. A month later, Amgen announced its acquisition of Immunex, the creators of Enbrel. Over time, Amgen shifted money away from marketing Kineret and focused on Enbrel, which generated almost $3 billion in 2006 sales, making it one of Amgen's top three products. Although commercial interest faded, research still pointed to the medical importance of interleukin-1. Its processing into a mature protein requires the activation of a protein complex called the inflammasome. Tschopp and his colleagues found that the inflammasome is activated by the uric acid crystals that accumulate in the joints of patients with gout 1 , and a small clinical trial showed that Kineret provided quick relief to those suffering an acute attack of gout. Other researchers have linked a hereditary inflammatory illness called neonatal-onset multisystem inflammatory disease to the inflammasome. Another small clinical trial showed that Kineret relieved symptoms of this disease, including hearing loss, brain lesions and rashes 2 . More recently, Kineret was shown to partially relieve the symptoms of type 2 diabetes 3 . And animal studies have suggested that type 2 diabetes may respond to interleukin-1 blockade but not to TNF-? inhibitors. Kineret itself has not proved popular, however, despite the promising trials. ?No one cares about Kineret,? says Eric Schmidt, an analyst at investment bankers Cowen and Company, based in New York. ?Maybe that's not reflective of the value of this pathway. Maybe Kineret is constrained by daily dosing. But it's just not competitive.?  \n                Trials race \n              Instead, companies are racing to make new interleukin-1 blockers. Amgen has an anti-interleukin-1 antibody in phase II clinical trials for rheumatoid arthritis. Novartis, which abandoned its first interleukin-1 project in 2000, now has an anti-interleukin-1 antibody in phase III trials for treatment of a rare inflammatory disorder called Muckle?Wells syndrome and phase II trials for rheumatoid arthritis. Previous trials showed remission of Muckle?Wells syndrome for up to six months after a single injection of antibody. Several smaller biotech companies have also entered the fray. Regeneron, based in Tarrytown, New York, submitted a biologics licence application to the FDA in May for its interleukin-1 blocker Rilonacept (IL-1 Trap) for treatment of Muckle?Wells syndrome and another inherited inflammatory disorder. And Xoma is testing an anti-interleukin-1 antibody in phase I studies in patients with type 2 diabetes. For Solinger, bringing a viable interleukin-1 therapy to market would be the culmination of a long scientific odyssey. Thirty years ago, he worked down the hall from the NIH laboratory in which Dinarello first purified the 'activating factor'. ?That's one reason why I'm excited about this,? he says. ?Fairly soon we should know if we have a winner or not.? \n                     Medline Anakinra page \n                   \n                     NCBI CINCA page \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

A 1-kilogram ball of fur, yet to be named, may be the best hope yet for saving the critically endangered South China tiger. That?s assuming that the male cub, born over the weekend on a wild-game reserve in South Africa, will one day be able to adjust to the jungles of China. The birth marks the first time a South China tiger has been born in a semi-natural setting ? an environment that some hope will improve the animal?s chances once released in the wild. The cub will receive some extra attention, including bottle-feeding, but will be allowed to roam the 150-acre park and learn to hunt wild antelope with his mother in a few months.  Chinese 'farms' are adept at rearing big cats: they have raised an estimated 5,000 Siberian tigers. But only 63 South China tigers remain in zoos and they have become so inbred that even captive pandas have better luck breeding. It has been two years since the last South China tiger cub was born in captivity. Fewer than ten animals are thought to exist in the wild. Li Quan, a former fashion executive turned conservationist, is hoping to release this cub, along with any others born to her four adult tigers, into two Chinese nature reserves. Their release may come as soon as next summer, coinciding with the Beijing Olympics. ?The project is to save the South China tiger from extinction,? says Li. ?The birth is a major step forward.?  Most conservationists are not so upbeat about Li?s reintroduction campaign. Some think her US$10 million should have been spent on improving the tigers? natural habitat, rather than on a breeding programme. An alternative project plans to release the almost genetically identical Indochinese tiger into South China, which many think will have a better chance of boosting animal numbers. True pessimists think that reinstating a healthy population of wild tigers in China is a pipe dream. ?They?re pretty much near extinction,? says Liu Yutang, a zoologist at Northeast Forestry University in Harbin. ?It?s already too late to save the South China tigers.?  \n              Pretty picture \n            The birth in Africa follows on the heels of reports of a surprise wild tiger sighting last month in the remote mountain forests of Shaanxi Province. A farmer came forward with a photo, hinting that isolated pockets of wild tigers may still exist, though the population was declared functionally extinct in 2002. The news seemed to stimulate the Chinese government to redouble its efforts to save the tigers. But rumours and accusations immediately flew across the Chinese blogosphere that the photo, and the sighting, were false. Critics argued that the stripes seemed wrong for a South China tiger, or that the vegetation size indicated that the animal in the photo was too small. Evidence surfaced two weeks ago that the tiger in the farmer?s photo bears striking similarities to a popular Chinese New Year poster sold in the area a few years back. \"The photos are considered fake by most of the Chinese public and even some officials,\" says Li. The local government has defended the authenticity of the photo. The government is planning a survey of the region this winter, which may settle the debate.  ?If there are several living tigers out there, that would be marvellous,? says Ron Tilson, director of conservation at the Minnesota Zoo near Minneapolis. ?It would obviously be the place to start a recovery programme,? he says.  \n              Gene swap \n            Tilson is running a different programme, which aims to reintroduce a completely different tiger subspecies: albeit one that?s almost indistinguishable from the South China tiger. The Indochinese tiger comes from South-east Asia, where more than 1,000 are thought to live in the wild.  Muddling of genetic stock might not be such a big problem. Yue Bisong of Sichuan University in Chengdu says that of 45 purported South China tigers he has genetically sampled, only 13 were the real deal. The rest had all been genetically contaminated as a result of poor breeding and management. Tilson aims to introduce 15 tigers into three nature reserves over the next decade; both reintroduction programmes may happen concurrently. Reprints and Permissions"},

Those who are unnerved by creepy crawlies should stop reading now ? a newly discovered two-and-a-half-metre monster arthropod, the largest yet discovered, is being unleashed on the world. Luckily for those of a nervous disposition, the release of this long-extinct relative of sea scorpions is limited to the pages of the journal  Biology Letters . There, Simon Braddy of the University of Bristol, UK, and colleagues report finding a 46-centimetre claw from a  Jaekelopterus rhenaniae ? from which they infer the existence of a giant example of this species 1 . Although called a 'sea' scorpion, the 400-million-year-old beast probably terrorized lakes and rivers, and rarely, if ever, ventured into the oceans.  \"This huge monster lived alongside other sea scorpions and fish,\" says Braddy. \"They would probably lie in wait. When another animal went in front of it, it would lurch forward and capture it. ... These things would tear their prey to shreds and then eat the little pieces.\"  \n              Scaled up \n           The  J. rhenaniae  claw was found near Pr\u00a3m in Germany. To work out the size of the arthropod it belonged to, Braddy and colleagues collected information on other sea scorpions and the ratio between their claw size and body length. This turned out to be relatively constant, leading the researchers to conclude that a creature with a 46-centimetre claw probaby had a body length of between 233 and 259 centimetres, or 333 and 359 centimetres including the claws and arms. \"I was amazed,\" says Braddy. \"Whenever I?ve shown the picture to people they?re equally amazed. ... When you work out how big this beast was you?re staggered by the size of it.\" Unlike some crabs, sea scorpions are not known to grow a single enormous claw, so extrapolation is reasonably straightforward, says Braddy. Greg Edgecombe, a palaeontologist at the Natural History Museum in London, said the researchers were \"on pretty safe grounds\" with their calculations. A previous sea scorpion find had been reported as being 250 centimetres long based on a similar extrapolation from its claw size, Braddy says. But Braddy's new analysis indicates that this beast was actually a puny 210 centimetres long, leaving  J. rhenaniae  the arthropod crown-holder for size. \"It changes our ideas about what is possible,\" says Edgecombe of these creatures. \"It forces us to modify our ideas about how large arthropods can be.\"  \n              Big boys \n            Exactly how or why this animal grew to the size it did is unclear. Giant arthropods, including huge millipedes and dragonflies, are known to have existed on land during the Carboniferous, some 359 million to 299 million years ago. Their existence is sometimes explained by an increase in the levels of atmospheric oxygen at that time. This could have allowed creatures with breathing systems that relied on the diffusion of oxygen into tissues, rather than a full-blown respiratory system, to grow much larger.  But giant aquatic sea scorpions existed before this oxygen boost, notes Braddy.  Another theory holds that the size of these animals is the result of an evolutionary arms race with their prey, which included armoured fish. Braddy speculates that they grew so big because of a lack of competition from vertebrates. When vertebrates arrived, it could have spelled the end for the giant scorpions. \"It?s a case of the vertebrates coming along and spoiling the arthropod party,\" he says. Reprints and Permissions"},

A census of polar bears in Canada?s Hudson Bay has lent some hard numbers to the long-held fear that retreating sea ice is causing some bears to starve or drown. Biologists have predicted that polar bears will struggle to survive as summer comes sooner to the Arctic. Less time spent on icy hunting platforms means the bears are slimming down before winter sets in. And there were anecdotal reports in 2005 of more bears found swimming far out at sea; a few were found floating dead, presumably drowned. But so far no evidence has directly linked the trend of melting sea ice associated with climate change to bear deaths. Now, looking at 20 years of data from bears captured along the coast of Hudson Bay, a team of scientists from the United States and Canada has found that fewer of the youngest and oldest bears survived in years when the ice broke early. ?Survivorship has dropped in the cubs, subadults and very old animals and is directly related to the date of break-up,? says Ian Stirling, a biologist with the Canadian Wildlife Service in Edmonton, Alberta, and an author on the report. Because Hudson Bay is near the southern edge of polar bear habitat, what happens there may foreshadow the fate of more northern populations, the authors say.  \n              Missing cubs \n            Although the timing of ice break-up varies from year to year, the trend has been towards more days of open water. Historically, ice has filled Hudson Bay for eight months each year. Now the ice is clearing nearly three weeks earlier than it did 30 years ago. Since 1984, wildlife managers have captured a few per cent of the bears that spend their summers on the western shore of the bay, releasing them with ear tags and lip tattoos. The marks allow biologists to recognize individual bears, track their fate and estimate how many survive each winter. Over two decades, this population has declined by more than 20%. Eric Regehr of the US Geological Survey in Anchorage, Alaska, and colleagues compared the bear numbers with available data on sea-ice extent. Adult bears in their prime ? those between 5 and 19 years old ? seem unaffected by the changes in ice cover. But many of the cubs, subadults and old bears captured in years when the ice broke the earliest weren?t spotted again.  ?The earlier the break-up, the poorer the survival,? Stirling says. For each additional ice-free week, survival of these most vulnerable ages decreased by 2?5%.  That?s the main reason behind the population decline, Stirling and colleagues report in the November issue of the  Journal of Wildlife Management 1 .  \n              Thin ice, thin bears \n            Biologists were already worried about this population of bears. Back in 1999, before the population started to decline, the same census found that bears became thin in years with less ice 2 . Polar bears fast through their summer by stocking up on weanling ring seals. In early spring, the bears feast on unwary seal pups until the ice breaks up, storing up much of the energy they?ll need to get by. In years when the ice breaks early, the less-able hunters catch fewer seals than they need. Now it seems the hunger is leading to deaths. ?It?s scary,? says Martyn Obbard, who keeps tabs on polar bears at the southern edge of Hudson Bay for the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources in Peterborough, but did not participate in this study. ?The evidence and their conclusions are solid.?  Obbard studies bears farther south than the western population now experiencing a decline in numbers. Because wind and currents sweep ice into this part of the bay, the effect of earlier ice break-up has been less severe here. But Obbard?s group has also seen skinnier bears. In a recently completed study, they found that bears captured in the past five years weighed 15% less than bears of comparable length captured 20 years ago 3 . ?It seems to me that the southern Hudson Bay population is probably on the same trajectory as the western Hudson Bay population was,? Obbard says, ?but there?s a lag.? They haven?t yet counted fewer bears, he says, but ?it looks like we?re headed that way?. The United States is considering listing polar bears as threatened under the Endangered Species Act; a decision on this is expected early next year. \n                   UN: polar bears \n                 Reprints and Permissions"},

Cutting back on calories is a sure way to extend the lifespan of any organism, from yeast to mice. Now it seems that an antidepressant can trick worms' brains into thinking they're on a diet, pushing their fleeting lifespan of three weeks to more than four. Such biochemical tinkering could form the basis for drugs that attempt to prevent the onset of age-related diseases, says Linda Buck, a molecular biologist at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, Washington, who led the work published in  Nature  this week 1 . The drug that has this effect - mianserin (trade name Tolvon) - is an atypical antidepressant, distinct from the more familiar antidepressants such as Prozac, Paxil and Zoloft. Mianserin works by hampering the brain?s response to serotonin, a neurotransmitter that is involved in the regulation of appetite and mood.  \n              Model worm \n            The nematode worm,  Caenorhabditis elegans , has been used as a model of ageing for decades, helping scientists to uncover details about what happens to human bodies as they grow old. Scientists are just starting to find drugs that slow ageing. To speed the search, Buck and colleague Michael Petrascheck tested 88,000 chemicals from a chemical library to see if any of them turned worms into long-lived Methuselahs. Their five-year hunt turned up more than 100 chemicals that boosted the worms? lifespan. But there was little known about how these chemicals react in biological systems. So Petrascheck scoured catalogues of better studied drugs to see if any had a similar structure to the experimental chemicals. He then checked to see if the drug had the same effect as their chemical had on the worms. ?It was a long shot in the dark,? he says. But it worked. Petrascheck chanced on several drugs that resembled a chemical unmemorably named 272N18, which had increased lifespan by a fifth in his first round of tests. One of the drugs, mianserin, lengthened the worms' lives by a third.  \n              All in your mind \n            Mianserin interacts with two brain chemicals involved in hunger: serotonin, which signals the presence of food, and octopamine, which signals starvation. The drug preferentially blocks one kind of serotonin receptor, hindering this receptor from doing its normal job. ?We may tip the balance in the direction of a starvation response,? Buck says. The drug didn?t cause the worms to eat any less, suggesting that it did not slow ageing by actual calorie restriction. ?They don't look like they're starving and they?re quite active,? Buck says. But the researchers do think mianserin works by the same mechanism as calorie restriction. Worms on a strict diet don't get an additional lifespan boost from mianserin, suggesting that whatever benefit is gained by either calorie restriction or the drug gets 'topped out' by that factor. And worms missing some genes known to be involved in the youth-giving effect of calorie restriction get less of a lifespan benefit from mianserin.  \n              Pop a pill \n            Finding drugs that slow ageing in worms is an important first step towards addressing ageing in humans, says David Sinclair, a biologist at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, who is affiliated with a company that is seeking to develop anti-ageing drugs for people. But Buck cautions against taking her team?s preliminary findings to suggest that humans could get the same benefit from mianserin. She plans to test the drug next in mice. Her team will also tackle the 100 or so other chemicals their search turned up to learn more about what causes animals to age - and how to slow the process. \n                   Linda Buck's bio \n                 Reprints and Permissions"},

Australia?s new prime minister Kevin Rudd has wasted little time getting to work on an election pledge to ratify the Kyoto Protocol on greenhouse-gas emissions. Rudd, a 50-year-old former diplomat, led the Labor party to an emphatic victory in Saturday?s election, claiming 83 of the 150 seats in the lower house of the national parliament ? up from 60 at the last election in 2004. The following day, Rudd reiterated his promise to ratify the climate protocol by Christmas. Ousted leader John Howard had steadfastly refused to back the pact throughout his 11-year tenure. \"Australia now has an opportunity to be part of the leadership on the issue of action on climate change,\" says Denise Boyd from the Australian Conservation Foundation in Melbourne. \"Before, they?ve been a laggard.\"  \n              Quick action \n            Rudd held meetings with government officials on Sunday to discuss the administrative details of exactly how to go about ratifying the treaty. His deputy, Julia Gillard, told reporters it was an executive action that did not need parliamentary approval. \"Ratifying Kyoto we can do without the parliament sitting,\" she said. Rudd will be moving forward with it \"very soon\" she added. In his first days in office, Rudd also confirmed that he plans to lead Australia's delegation to the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Bali next week. This meeting will see the United States as the sole developed nation that still shuns the Kyoto process. John Connor, chief executive of the Climate Institute of Australia in Sydney, says the country?s changed stance is already causing ripples in the international climate scene. \"It will be a huge boost to the Bali negotiations to have one of the blockers change into a real supporter,\" he says.  \n              Changing weather \n            Climate change has been a defining issue in the election campaign, which was conducted during what government officials have said is the worst drought in Australia's recorded history. Exit polls conducted on Saturday confirmed its importance, notes Connor. Among 2,500 people surveyed as they left polling stations, the economy and health were the top two issues, with climate change and industrial relations equal in the third spot, he says. ?It is clear that climate change was a top-tier issue in the election,? says Connor. ?Rudd has a responsibility, and we believe an intent, to take a leadership role on climate change.?  On the domestic front, Rudd has vowed to establish interim targets for an emissions-trading regime by mid-2008, and to set a uniform mandatory renewable energy target by the end of next year. But no details have yet been released; and details, says Connor, will determine the success of the effort. Australia had originally negotiated a generous allowance of an 8% increase over 1990 greenhouse emissions by 2012 under the Kyoto Protocol, despite not ratifying the agreement. They have been on track with this target, but Connor says Rudd?s government should aim to have greenhouse emissions actually declining within five years, and ensure that all new electricity coming into the 'baseload' grid is from clean sources. \n                   Climate politics special \n                 \n                   Australian Labor Party \n                 \n                   Liberal Party of Australia \n                 \n                   The Climate Institute \n                 \n                   Australian Conservation Foundation \n                 Reprints and Permissions"},

Salamanders aren?t exactly the animals that spring to mind when it comes to long-distance journeys. But researchers studying their ancient history say that these usually unadventurous animals once relocated some 25,000 kilometres from America to Asia ? and then some of them came back again. The plethodontidae salamander family contains about 380 species, 98% of which live in the Americas. The other 2% live in Europe and Korea, and no one knew how they got there. Distributions like this are common amongst fast-travelling birds and mammals, ?but how salamanders managed something like this has been one of the big biogeographic mysteries of the past hundred years?, says David Vieites, an author of the new study. The mystery started to unravel four years ago when Vieites and his colleagues went to Korea to study the newly-discovered and only-known Asian plethodontid,  Karsenia koreana 1 .  Karsenia  was found to be closely related to a genus called  Hydromantes , found in both California and Europe. But it was different enough to merit a new genus name, and to indicate a long period of independent evolution. The most likely explanation seemed to be that a North American salamander lineage had travelled from America to Asia millions of years ago. Such a journey seemed rather improbable, so Vieites and a team of biologists at the University of California, Berkeley sequenced DNA from three key genes in 43 plethodontid species to work out whether this evolutionary story was correct. They confirm that  Karsenia  is a descendant of North American species 2 . And they add information about its sideways relationships to European species and  Hydromantes  in California, that indicates that the latter two ?sister? lineages both arose originally in Asia. Together these data suggest that salamanders travelled from America to Asia in the late Cretaceous (some 80 million years ago), and then some of them went back again at the Paleocene/Eocene boundary (some 55 million years ago). Such genetic studies are necessary for unpicking the travel history of salamanders because they are rare in the fossil record; their bones are too small and delicate to last. But they aren't conclusive, says evolutionary biologist Jim Hanken of Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts. ?I wouldn?t bet my house that [the] results of this study are definitive,? he says.  \n              Over the bridge \n            Although salamanders are amphibious, they do not swim in salt water, making ocean crossing impossible. This leaves the Bering land bridge, which has periodically connected Alaska and Siberia, as the easiest travelling route for these stubby-legged animals. The bridge has emerged and submerged many times in the past hundred million years and was above sea level when  Karsenia  evolved.  It is, however, odd for temperate-dwelling salamanders to be so far north as the Bering land bridge. ?Global warming was probably behind this intrepid journey,? says David Wake, an author on the study. A warm spell probably forced salamanders to move northwards to remain in comfortable temperatures, he explains, leading them to the bridge. Why they bothered crossing it is unknown.  \"Its hard to be sure of anything,\" says evolutionary biologist Brad Shaffer at the University of California, Davis. \"But the Bering strait hypothesis has lots of merit.\" If another Asian plethodontid is discovered, Hanken adds, a study of its genetics would be the best way to confirm this scenario. Wake and Vieites are now searching for more Asian salamanders. \n                   Discovery of the Asian salamander  \n                 \n                   Global Amphibian Assessment \n                 \n                   Amphibiaweb \n                 Reprints and Permissions"},

An argument has erupted over the environmental health of the area surrounding the Chernobyl nuclear reactor that exploded catastrophically more than two decades ago. Humans are still forbidden to live within 30 kilometres of the site of the 1986 accident, described as the worst environmental disaster of all time. But this evacuation zone is still home to many bird and animal species. Some research has determined that this wildlife is still suffering the effects of the disaster; other ecologists have declared that the area's ecosystem is thriving and that the radiation has had no lasting effect on wildlife. A debate is now simmering in the pages of the journal  Biology Letters  over the specific issue of birds in the area. Researchers who believe that detailed census data show that bird populations have been affected by the radioactivity of the landscape are butting heads with another who thinks that this conclusion is flawed.  \n              Swallows and barns \n            In July this year, Anders M\u00a3ller of the Universit\u00a3 Pierre et Marie Curie in Paris and Timothy Mousseau of the University of South Carolina in Columbia reported 1  that, in regions where radiation remains highest, bird abundance and population density is reduced. But Jim Smith of the University of Portsmouth, UK, now criticizes 2  that research. He argues that the effects could be due to declines in species such as barn swallows ( Hirundo rustica ) that rely on the presence of humans to thrive. More than 330,000 people were evacuated from the exclusion zone, which covers the Chernobyl region of Ukraine, and a large swathe of neighbouring Belarus, where prevailing winds blew much of the radioactive matter. Abandonment of farms by the evacuees could be the real reason why birds such as barn swallows now seem to be suffering, Smith argues. \"I don't think they've proved there's been damage to barn swallows [as a result of radioactivity],\" says Smith. \"It annoys me when I see people casting doubt on [ecosystem recovery] on the basis of a study of barn swallows.\" M\u00a3ller, Mousseau and their colleagues respond in the same issue of the journal 3 , arguing that barn swallows commonly breed in wild sites as well as farms.  \n              Keeping tabs \n            The argument highlights the fact that, M\u00a3ller's team argues, no proper effort has been made to monitor Chernobyl's ecosystems. It claims that international organizations such as the World Health Organization and the International Atomic Energy Agency have relied on \"anecdotal evidence\". \"Why has there been no concerted effort to monitor the long-term effects of Chernobyl on free-living organisms and humans?\" M\u00a3ller and his colleagues write. Although there are no plans to repopulate the exclusion zone, an estimated 5 million people still live on land contaminated by the accident. Smith argues that the biggest impacts of the accident on humans have clearly been \"social and psychological\", as a result of the trauma of evacuation. He admits that published research on ecological impacts, in Western journals at least, is scant. But he points to evidence that rare and threatened species are colonizing the zone (see  Chernobyl ecosystems remarkably healthy ). And he notes that the Belarusian government has declared a large chunk of the zone as a ?state radioecological reserve?.  Smith adds that the Russian-language literature contains many more detailed accounts of the health of Chernobyl's wildlife. Many of these accounts, he says, suggest that wildlife is indeed bouncing back. \"We need to be coming to a consensus about whether this is true or not,\" he says. \"Ecosystems are complicated, and it's very difficult to test hypotheses. It's not an easy thing to do adequately.\" The debate comes just days after the United Nations declared an end to the 'emergency phase' of the disaster. In a resolution adopted last week at its New York headquarters, it declared that efforts should now focus on recovery and sustainable development of those displaced by the evacuation, rather than treating them as victims in need of emergency aid. The report did not address wildlife remaining within the zone. \n                   Ecology news  \n                 \n                   Earth and environment news \n                 \n                   International Atomic Energy Agency Chernobyl focus  \n                 \n                   United Nations Chernobyl website  \n                 Reprints and Permissions"},

A clinical trial of gene therapy in which a woman died this summer is due to recommence, thanks to a decision from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced yesterday. The experimental therapy for rheumatoid arthritis was stopped after one of the participants, 36-year-old Jolee Mohr, died in July. Autopsy findings presented in September showed that Mohr died of a massive fungal infection complicated by major internal bleeding, and that the gene therapy itself may not have been to blame (see  Gene therapy might not have caused patient's death ). Independently of the gene therapy, Mohr was taking several drugs for her arthritis that suppress the immune system, which is a risk factor for this type of infection. Further evidence from tests on Mohr's tissues and blood has since supported this conclusion. The FDA has now lifted their hold on the trial. The FDA decision was announced by Targeted Genetics, the small Seattle-based biotechnology company that makes the gene therapy that was injected into Mohr?s right knee three weeks before she died. The company said that FDA had reached its decision after reviewing safety data from all 127 subjects in the trial.  ?The take-home message [of the FDA?s decision] is that this tragic incident was totally coincidental to her gene therapy, that the gene therapy was not implicated or involved and that this trial should proceed,? says Stewart Parker, the firm?s chief executive officer. The FDA has not made a statement about the rationale underlying its decision. It declined to comment to  Nature  except to confirm that it had lifted the hold on the trial. The full results of an investigation into the cause of Mohr?s death are due to be presented at a public meeting of the Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee (RAC) of the National Institutes of Health on 3 December.  \n              Multiple drugs \n            Robb Mohr, the widower of Jolee Mohr, called the FDA decision ?reckless?. The trial will continue to allow subjects taking immunosuppressive drugs to receive the gene therapy, he notes, and the therapy?s protein product is itself immunosuppressive. ?If they wanted to fire their testing back up and only test patients who are not on immunosuppressive drugs, I think that?s fine. But to test it on patients who are taking [immunosuppressive drugs] Enbrel or Humira; it?s reckless and very, very dangerous.? Parker defends the decision to allow trial subjects to continue taking the immunosuppressive drugs commonly used in rheumatoid arthritis. ?There is no scientific basis for changing [the protocol] based on the extensive preclinical data and the clinical data to date,? she says. She adds that patients who have a fever ? as Mohr did ? will not be allowed gene therapy until the fever passes.  Thomas Murray, a bioethicist and president of the Hastings Center in Garrison, New York, says that the FDA decision is particularly important in light of the bad publicity that has attended the gene-therapy field in recent years. For instance, several boys in France developed leukaemia in the early 2000s after receiving gene therapy for a rare immunodeficiency disease that is fatal if not treated. ?Another really terrible outcome of a gene-therapy trial would have been a significant blow to the field,? says Murray. ?This is as close to a full acquittal as the field could have hoped for.?  \n              Normal levels \n            The therapy in the Targeted Genetics? trial delivers a gene for an anti-inflammatory protein, TNFR:Fc, which eases the inflammation of rheumatoid arthritis. The gene is delivered using a virus as a vector. Parker says that final molecular tests, the results of which were presented at an American College of Rheumatology meeting earlier this month, found only trace amounts of the virus in tissues outside Mohr's joints. And levels of the relevant anti-inflammatory proteins were well within expected limits, given that Mohr was also taking Humira (adalimumab), an injected drug that works in the same way as the gene therapy.  Chris Evans, a gene therapist and arthritis expert at Harvard Medical School, who is preparing to launch his own gene-therapy trial in patients with osteoarthritis, said that he had spent this autumn worrying that regulators were going to put a moratorium on gene-therapy trials in arthritis. Yesterday?s news brought ?relief because there?s not going to be a moratorium?, he said. ?And we can all move forward.? Still, he expects that recruiting patients into gene-therapy trials is going to get more difficult. ?Once FDA says: ?It wasn?t the gene therapy after all?, the pendulum swings back, but not all the way.

You might scoff at doting parents who proudly tell you that their youngster, even though still in diapers, takes an instant liking to kind-hearted people and shows disdain for less savoury characters. But a new experiment shows that such claims could be more than parental pride. Babies, it seems, have a lot more social savvy than we credit them with. Research led by Kiley Hamlin, a graduate student at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut, shows that babies less than a year old can judge the niceness or nastiness of others, even when watching events that don't directly affect them. The researchers made the discovery using nothing more high-tech than a simple puppet show. After watching the show, the babies, aged either six months or ten months, instinctively preferred 'nice' characters over less helpful ones. This kind of skill may be useful in helping them learn the right values as their social awareness develops later in childhood. \"We knew that babies were socially skilled, but we weren't aware that they were so skilled that they could track people by their behavioural tendencies; how they might treat someone else,\" says Hamlin.  \n              Evil puppets \n           Hamlin and her colleagues showed the babies a puppet show in which the central character, a brightly coloured round wooden block complete with googly eyes, tried in vain to scale a steep hill. The puppet was then either given a friendly shove up the hill by a 'good Samaritan' puppet, or thwarted by an evil puppet who pushed the climber back down. After the show, the babies were encouraged to reach out for either the helper or the hinderer puppet. Almost all favoured the helper, Hamlin and her colleagues report in this week's  Nature 1 . \"This suggests to us that at least they're able to tell them apart, and also that they have some tendency towards the positive helper,\" Hamlin says. \"We were shocked by the strength of the responses. We thought infants would be sensitive to the behaviour of others, but didn't anticipate the extent of this.\" What's more, the effect was not so marked when the puppets' googly eyes were removed, showing that the babies identify with the puppets as characters and make their choice on the basis of the characters' actions, even though the babies were not personally affected by the show's events. In a second experiment, the babies were again shown the puppet show, and then saw the climber subsequently appear to 'make friends' with either helper or hinderer. The older babies spent longer looking at it when the climber approached the hinderer, suggesting that they found this event more surprising. The result shows that the older babies, although not the younger ones, can draw fairly sophisticated conclusions about the social attitudes and motives of others, say the researchers.  \n              Parental pride \n            \"You get a lot of parents saying their babies have these reactions to different kinds of people,\" says Hamlin. \"It's been said anecdotally but never tested experimentally before.\" The fact that babies can make choices like this at such an early age suggests that the ability to choose between nice and nasty may even be innate, Hamlin says. This may even form the bedrock of a child's social development, she suggests ? by favouring helpful over unhelpful people, a growing child may sow the seeds for strong social ties with others in later life. \"Just by spending more time with positive people, they might get a different set of learning inputs than if they spent time with negative people, and over time you can see that could have a real influence on their development,\" Hamlin says. \n                   More on babies  \n                 \n                   Language \n                 \n                   Yale University psychology department \n                 Reprints and Permissions"},

Alarm is growing among anthropologists in the United States over a plan that could empty institutions of about 120,000 human skeletons currently stored for research purposes. Under a new proposal, the bones at museums, universities and federal facilities across the nation could be given to Native American tribes now living in the area from which the remains were excavated, even if the skeletons are not culturally identifiable to the tribes. In October, the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA) programme, the agency that oversees the handling of American Indian remains, opened a 90-day comment period on the proposal. It would affect ancient skeletons similar to the Kennewick Man specimen from Washington state. Scientists won a long court battle to keep that 9,000-year-old skeleton for study after attempts to give it to tribes for likely disposal. Under current guidelines, bones that can be matched with a living tribe by using cultural evidence may be returned to them, but what to do with remains that are so old that they can't be associated with today's surviving tribes has been hotly debated for a decade. Setting up a system to dispose of these 'culturally unidentifiable' specimens is a natural progression from NAGPRA, which became federal law in 1990 after extensive negotiations between scientists and tribes, says Sherry Hutt who manages the NAGPRA programme. ?This is a proposal for disposition [in situations] such as when a new highway runs through an old graveyard,? says Hutt, an attorney and economist from Arizona. But major scientific organizations strongly dispute this view, calling the move ?illegal? because it goes beyond the Congressional law, and a ?divisive? manoeuvre that may shatter decades of working relationships between scientists and tribes. ?The rules would be disastrous,? says Phillip Walker, an anthroplogist at the University of California, Santa Barbara. A former member of NAGPRA's seven-person review committee, Walker helped prepare the American Association of Physical Anthropologists (AAPA) comments. The AAPA says that the proposal would allow the return of almost any skeleton, even those used in medical schools, would greatly hinder anatomical teaching, and would eliminate comparative material for studies. Many of the specimens are among the oldest, offering data on the continent's first humans.

A British resident who is under surveillance for suspected terrorist activities is being prohibited from taking secondary-school-level science courses by the government,  Nature  has learned. The man, referred to as A.E., is contesting the decision in court, in what is believed to be the first case of its kind. The preliminary hearing over whether A.E. should be allowed to take AS-level courses in human biology and chemistry took place on 16 November at London's High Court. The UK Home Office, which has an order restricting A.E.'s actions and affiliations, argues that such coursework could be turned towards terrorism. His solicitors counter that the knowledge is public, and that the furthering of A.E.'s education poses no threat. At the heart of the case is a simple question: should basic courses in science be treated as potential tools for terror when in the wrong hands? To protect the suspect, A.E.'s name and much of his personal information have been withheld from the public. What is known is that he is an unemployed Iraqi national in his mid-thirties who studied medicine at university in his home country. The government suspects him of terrorist affiliations, and he is the subject of a 'control order' ? a special legal instrument that places limits on his freedoms. Control orders were introduced by the UK government under the 2005 Prevention of Terrorism Act as a way of restricting the activities of suspected terrorists when prosecution would mean ?revealing sensitive and dangerous intelligence?. Among other things, control orders can be used to impose curfews, travel bans and limits on a person's access to mobile phones and the Internet. Nationally, 14 individuals are currently subject to control orders. Critics have lambasted the orders as a blatant infringement of civil liberties. Because the orders depend on classified information, subjects rarely know what evidence is being brought against them. Furthermore, the subjects are never charged with a crime. That makes control orders virtually impossible to rebut, according to Gareth Crossman, director for policy at Liberty, a London-based civil-rights organization. ?The whole system is totally unfair,? he says. Since 2006, A.E. has been under a control order that has limited his movements and affiliations, according to his lawyer, Mohammed Ayub of Chambers Solicitors in Bradford, UK. The order has made it impossible for A.E. to find work, says Ayub. So he instead sought to further his education. English-language courses went unopposed, but when in September A.E. applied to take the two science courses, the government told him he could not enrol. A Home Office spokeswoman was unable to comment because of the ongoing court case, but Ayub says the government fears that A.E. could turn his coursework towards terrorist ends. Scientists contacted by  Nature  say that AS-level coursework would be unlikely to help a terrorist. The human-biology material includes basic theories of disease transmission, according to Neil Roscoe, head of education and training at the Institute of Biology in London. But there's no information on how to intentionally spread pathogens. ?I'd say that there's very little in the chemistry course that would help a terrorist act,? adds Colin Osborne, who heads education at the Royal Society of Chemistry. Still, both Osborne and Roscoe say the courses would include some information that might be useful to someone interested in committing a terrorist act. The human-biology course includes a detailed examination of neurotoxins, for example. And chemistry labs would contain some dangerous compounds and teach basic techniques such as distillation. ?If the government wants to be cautious, there are aspects that could be considered as aiding the cause,? says Roscoe. On issues of science and security, he adds, ?there's never going to be an easy answer?. But other scientists remain unconvinced. Peter Atkins, emeritus professor of physical chemistry at the University of Oxford, says the techniques taught in the course are simple: ?Anybody with an interest in cooking could do them.? Ayub maintains that A.E.'s only interest in the classes is to return to university and continue his medical education. Ayub, himself a former oncologist, points out that A.E.'s level of knowledge is already well beyond an AS-level course. ?It's absurd,? he says.

The United Kingdom has abruptly announced its intention to withdraw from the Gemini Observatory, potentially leaving hundreds of British astronomers without a major telescope in the Northern Hemisphere. The Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC) said on 15 November that it would pull out of the international observatory, with its twin 8-metre telescopes in Chile and Hawaii. The STFC, one of seven UK national research councils, pays for major physics and astronomy projects. It has nearly a quarter stake in Gemini and pays annual subscription fees of \u00a34 million (US$8.2 million). The British astronomical community has reacted with shock and dismay. ?It's a mistake,? says Royal Astronomical Society president Michael Rowan-Robinson. ?I think it damages our ability to do multi-wavelength astronomy.? UK astronomers were not consulted before the decision, says Roger Davies, an astrophysicist at the University of Oxford and former Gemini board chair. ?I was shocked,? he adds. ?Gemini is a world-ranked facility ? it's our only access to the Northern Hemisphere.? Astronomers in the United Kingdom can still use the Southern Hemisphere telescopes of the European Southern Observatory in Chile. Rowan-Robinson wants the STFC to negotiate a partial partnership with Gemini that would allow them to retain observation time in Hawaii. The Gemini observatories opened in 1999 (north) and 2001 (south), with capabilities in both the optical and infrared wavelength ranges. The infrared allows astronomers to peer deep into the ancient corners of the Universe. As part of the Gemini Deep Deep Survey, astronomers discovered that young galaxies, forming 3 billion to 6 billion years after the Big Bang, were bigger and more mature than previously thought (K. Glazebrook  et al .  Nature   430 , 181?184; 2004). Other Gemini member countries include the United States, Canada, Australia, Argentina, Brazil and Chile. The STFC announced its intention at the Gemini board meeting in La Serena, Chile. On 21 November, it must inform its own governing council on how it plans to save \u00a380 million in the next three years. ?In this financial climate, we are staring very hard at our programmes,? says spokesman Peter Barratt. The STFC paid \u00a330 million between 1994 and 2001 towards Gemini's construction. By leaving the observatory, the council would pay a penalty of \u00a38 million. UK astronomers would immediately forfeit their observation time, which was 23% of the available time on each telescope, or about 70 nights of the year. The Gemini board issued a statement on 16 November saying it was confident that it could resolve the funding without interrupting operations. Wayne Van Citters, a Gemini board member from the National Science Foundation, the US funding body, noted that the STFC had not yet formally given notice. There could still be room to negotiate, he says.\n \n                     Gemini Observatory \n                   \n                     Science and Technology Facilities Council website \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Small mammals have a habit of avoiding paved roads and being hesitant to cross them. But ecologists have not been able to agree whether the problem lies with the road itself or with the cars roaring by. A new study hints that it's the open space, rather than the noise or pollution of traffic, that puts small animals off. Roads carve up forests and isolate animal populations. This can be a pressing concern for fragmented populations of endangered small mammals, such as Vancouver marmot, Preble's meadow jumping mouse and Nelson's antelope squirrel, which to breed widely to maintain genetic diversity in their dwindling numbers. Conservationists have various options for encouraging migration of animals. They can shut down roads, control traffic or build corridors underneath the highways. But to make the best decision they need to know why roads are problematic in the first place.  \n              Catch and release \n            To investigate, a team of biologists at Carleton University in Ottawa captured Eastern chipmunks ( Tamias striatus ) and white-footed mice ( Peromyscus leucopus ) and tagged their ears so that their movements could be tracked. They relocated 159 chipmunks and 244 mice with varying numbers of roads standing between them and their homes. The team then looked to see whether the number of roads, or the frequency of traffic on those roads, was linked to how many animals made it home. Some roads were practically deserted; others carried more than 15,000 vehicles a day. They report in  The Journal of Applied Ecology  that 51% of the mammals that were relocated across one road returned home, compared with 77% of those moved a similar distance but with no roads to cross. In relocations in which multiple roads needed to be crossed, the probability of returning was reduced by about 50% for each additional road. Perhaps surprisingly, traffic levels made no difference to these numbers. Additionally, the team noted that areas adjacent to roads were just as populated with small mammals as were sites farther away from roads. This also suggests that noise and traffic aren't a major issue for these animals.  ?They are avoiding paved roads, but don?t seem to mind being near them,? says Lenore Fahrig, an author on the study.  \n              No single solution \n            Previous research with amphibians and reptiles have shown worryingly high death rates owing to traffic, says Fahrig. But the situation with small mammals is clearly different ? they seem to be able to dodge the cars better. That's good news for the mammals, but it complicates the problem of how to protect all wildlife. \"This is a strong signal that aside from ripping out roads completely, we do not yet have a single solution that is going to work for all species,\" says Fahrig. Likewise, large animals seem to react differently to roads. Extensive work has shown that traffic volume does put off elk, deer and moose, for example. ?Many assume that patterns demonstrated by animal 'A' will apply to animal 'B', yet this rigorous study shows that isn?t true,\" says ecologist Joel Berger at the Wildlife Conservation Society in New York. But at least as far as chipmunks are concerned, the study hints that animal-friendly tunnels might be a good solution.  In Canada, notes Berger, ecologists are developing multi-million dollar roadway overpasses for large animals like grizzly bears. \"It would be great if this study could get the people involved in huge projects like these to think about the little guys too,\" says Berger. \n                   Road Ecology Center At University of California, Davis \n                 \n                   Wildlife Conservation Society \n                 Reprints and Permissions"},

The Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) and the World Health Organization (WHO) released new statistics on the global prevalence of HIV and AIDS on 20 November. Their new report estimates that 33.2 million people worldwide are infected with HIV; in 2006 the estimate was 39.5 million.  According to the report, the 16% reduction in the estimate is the result of better data and better epidemiological interpretation of those data, particularly in India.  The revision is a kind of vindication for those in the AIDS research community who have long maintained that UNAIDS numbers were too high. James Chin, an epidemiologist at the University of California Berkeley School of Public Health, has for years argued this, suggesting that the programme perhaps liked the numbers high to perpetuate a sense of escalating crisis. ?The problem that I see is that UNAIDS basically painted themselves into a corner by not paying closer attention to the numbers until now because they were happy with them,? he says. ?They were happy with the idea that it was ever-increasing and always ready to jump into the general population. I think they finally could not continue that when the numbers from these surveys came in.? Geoffrey Garnett, an epidemiologist at Imperial College London, UK, who has been involved in the work on the UN estimates for the past seven years, disagrees. When asked if there were political goals behind the numbers, he replied: \"Not at all. I think there genuinely has been a big improvement in our estimates.\" \"Even with the adjusted rates the extent of the epidemic is still huge; the UN did not need to inflate the rates for that,\" says Leontine Alkema, a statistician at the University of Washington, Seattle, who has worked on HIV prevalence estimates and projections.  \n              Clinic and field \n            Different types of information gathering give different results for HIV prevalence. In general, costly population-based surveys, in which subjects are chosen at random and tested, give lower, more accurate estimates of infection rates. But most data on HIV prevalence come from 'sentinel' surveys, where women who turn up at antenatal clinics are tested for HIV. The new lower estimate reflects an increase in the number of population-based surveys and a different way of handling sentinel surveys. In the new report, sentinel survey results are assumed to overestimate infection rates, so these numbers are multiplied by 0.8 to estimate the true figures. Previously, this adjustment was only made for rural populations. \"The difference between antenatal clinic prevalence and results from population-based surveys is much bigger than expected,\" says Alkema. In 2006 the estimate was that between 34.1 and 47.1 million people were infected worldwide; the new estimate for 2007 is 30.6?36.1 million.  \n              Longer life \n            In addition, the report contains a new estimate of how long an untreated person will live after being infected with HIV. This was previously held to be nine years, but is now assumed to be 11 years (except where one subtype of the virus, called 'E', is dominant, where 9 years remains the estimate). Alongside estimates of the number of people infected at any given time, this longer lifespan reduces estimates of annual new infections. Adjusted estimates show that new infections peaked at more than 3 million a year in the late 1990s, and have fallen to 2.5 million in 2007. ?We?ve now got a much, much clearer idea of what is happening with the global HIV pandemic,? says Garnett. The increased knowledge also helps with prevention efforts, he adds. ?We know much better where to intervene ? in particular in southern Africa and in high-risk groups in Asia.?  \n              Cause for concern \n            But Garnett is concerned that the public will interpret the lower estimates as a signal that the epidemic is no longer worth worrying about. That's clearly not true. However, he adds, it is worth noting that there have been some real reductions in HIV infections. \"In some places we are seeing real declines in prevalence related to changes in behaviour,\" he says. Chin agrees with Garnett that HIV is still an urgent and ongoing problem, particularly in Africa and Asia. The revision means that a greater, but still unacceptably low percentage of the population are getting treatment. ?We still have a long ways to go.? \n                   Nature Collections AIDS \n                 \n                   Improved Diagnostic Technologies for the Developing World \n                 \n                   AIDS Special \n                 \n                   UNAIDS \n                 \n                   UNAIDS 2007 AIDS epidemic update \n                 \n                   The AIDS Pandemic, by Jim Chin \n                 Reprints and Permissions"},

But its operators face major obstacles, as Tatum Anderson reports. On the outskirts of Kampala, and rather at odds with the dusty, low-rise buildings around it, stands a state-of-the-art, glass-fronted pharmaceutical plant. Opened with great fanfare last month by Yoweri Museveni, the president of Uganda, the factory will manufacture drugs to treat HIV/AIDS and malaria for markedly less than the cost of imported drugs. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that in Uganda, fewer than 38% of the patients with HIV/AIDS that need antiretroviral drugs receive them. But although Africa carries the largest burden of HIV/AIDS and malaria in the world, it produces only 1% of the world's drugs, according to the World Bank. ?We want local solutions to local problems and this is the first step to say we can do it ourselves,? says Fred Kitaka, finance director of Quality Chemicals, the Ugandan company that co-runs the plant. Previously a drug importer, Quality Chemicals put up two-thirds of the US$30-million it cost to build facility, which can produce 6 million tablets per day. Cipla, a drug manufacturer based in Mumbai, India, has provided the remaining US$8.5 million, as well as consulting services. The Indian firm also holds 50% of the shares in Quality Chemical Industries, the company that runs the new plant. The factory will start by producing some of Cipla's most widely used fixed-dose combination drugs, including an antiretroviral called Triomune, which contains lamivudine, stavudine and nevirapine. It will also produce Lumartem, an antimalarial combination therapy that is made by Novartis under the brand name of Coartem. The plant will start manufacturing early next year and will initially sell antiretroviral drugs at two-thirds of the cost of imported products. As production volumes rise, the factory claims that it will reduce prices further. Kitaka says that the company can produce cheaper drugs by taking advantage of the staggered timetable for compliance with Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS), a global agreement under which companies can enforce patents on their products and prevent copycat producers from selling them. At the moment, many of the drugs used by Ugandans are manufactured in India. But changes to India's patent law in 2005 to bring it in line with TRIPS mean that newer drugs are more likely to be patented, and therefore more expensive, says Kitaka. As one of the world's least-developed countries, Uganda does not need to pass TRIPS-compliant laws until 2016. It can therefore manufacture drugs that would be patented elsewhere until that time. (As it happens, Uganda is planning to revise its patents laws earlier than that.) Figures from the WHO indicate that by 2005, 37 African countries had pharmaceutical industries, albeit on a small scale. There is strong political will in Africa to boost these facilities. But a 2005 World Bank study has shown that local manufacturing often does not make economic sense for poor countries. Production costs rise considerably because African countries often lack reliable supplies of electricity and water, as well as the engineers, chemists and other skilled staff needed to run drug factories. Raw materials for the drugs, as well and plastics and other packaging materials, may also have to be shipped in from elsewhere.  \n                Viable markets \n              Sandeep Juneja, HIV project head at the Indian manufacturer Ranbaxy Laboratories says he doubts that many plants will be viable in Africa. An export market that consists purely of other low-income countries would be too small, he says. And under TRIPS, companies that set up factories that are exempt from licensing payments in low-income countries are extremely limited in the drugs they can export to slightly wealthier countries with tighter patent rules, such as Nigeria, Kenya or South Africa. Additionally, plants in India and elsewhere that manufacture low-margin antiretrovirals often share overheads with lucrative, high-margin drugs. An African plant, however, ?would have to recover all costs, including salaries, exclusively from the antiretrovirals, which may make it unviable?, Juneja says. The effect of TRIPS exemptions on countries such as Uganda are also limited by the fact that so many of the drugs imported from India are off-patent anyway, observers say. And even though Africa is home to some highly reputable manufacturers, such as South Africa's Aspen Pharmacare, which makes drugs licensed by GlaxoSmithKline, many health-care officials have doubts about the quality control of drugs produced in other African facilities. Factories must reach international manufacturing standards before aid agencies will buy their drugs or other countries will import them. But the WHO, which certifies factories as having reached such standards, says that not many African manufacturers have even applied for inspections. Industry observers say that with few inspectors to certify plants, factories wait perilously long for inspections. ?We are finding high-quality local producers who are going out of business because the certification process is not resourced to do the job,? says Philippa Saunders of Oxfam's Essential Drugs Project, based in London. Despite the odds, Uganda's government, manufacturers and Cipla are determined to surmount these obstacles at the Kampala factory. The government ? which helped to broker the deal between Cipla and Quality Chemicals ? plans to expand Uganda's processing of active ingredients so that raw materials do not have to be imported. And in a technology-transfer arrangement, Cipla has overseen the design and building of the Quality Chemicals factory so that it meets international standards and can export to other African countries. It is also providing 40 staff to train Ugandan workers to run the factory over the next couple of years. So Kitaka is confident of a return on investment in six or seven years, although he acknowledges that the firm's success will depend on a great many factors. And the stakes are more than financial. ?We're not just making money,? he says, ?we are helping the communities we live in.? \n                     Ugandan government report \n                   \n                     Cipla \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

A part-time palaeontologist who programs computers as a day job has uncovered a new dinosaur species ? not buried in the ground but hidden in the bowels of the Natural History Museum in London, UK. After 113 years lying unloved and unstudied in the museum's vaults, the fossil's importance was finally realized by Mike Taylor, who was trawling the museum's collections as part of his part-time study for a PhD at the University of Portsmouth. He stumbled across the new species ? represented by a single bone from the dinosaur's spine ? and realized that it was unique. \"It leapt out at me as being different,\" says Taylor, who specializes in sauropods, the group of long-necked, plant-eating dinosaurs that includes the famous  Diplodocus. The newly described dinosaur is not just a new species but belongs to a completely new genus, christened  Xenoposeidon.  'Xeno', which translates as 'alien', reflects the fact that it is quite different to its known relatives. 'Poseidon' comes from the Greek for 'Earth shaker'.  \n              Relatively small \n            The biggest sauropods could reach a staggering 70 tonnes ? the size of today's biggest whales. But  Xenoposeidon  was probably more modestly proportioned, coming in at about the size of an elephant. It probably lived around 140 million years ago, say Taylor and his Portsmouth colleague Darren Naish, who describe the specimen in the journal  Palaeontology 1 . The creature's remains are represented by just the single 30-centimetre bone uncovered by Taylor at the museum. The museum's records show that the specimen was dug up in the early 1890s near Hastings, in southern England, by the fossil-hunter Philip James Rufford. When it was deposited in the museum, it was briefly reviewed by palaeontologist Richard Lydekker, before beginning its long wait to achieve its due recognition. Although 113 years is not much when you've been dead for 140 thousand millennia, it nevertheless seems remarkable that a new dinosaur genus could go unnoticed for so long in the museum's collection. But with such a huge archive, noteworthy items can indeed escape recognition, says Paul Barrett, a palaeontologist at the museum. \"We have thousands of dinosaur specimens in our collection,\" he says. \"Our collections still offer us lots of surprises.\"  \n              Bones of contention \n            Taylor adds that the fact that this dinosaur is represented by a solitary bone probably contributed to its elusiveness. \"If it's only a single bone it is so much easier to 'lose down the back of the sofa',\" he says.  Vertebrae are among the most readily preserved elements of sauropod skeletons ? in contrast with their relatively small skulls, which do not fossilize as easily, says Taylor. But because their body plans are fairly well-studied, a single bone from the spine can reveal lots about a sauropod's overall shape and size. Taylor, who hopes to complete his part-time doctoral studies in the next two to four years, says he is \"extremely confident\" that more new species will be found buried in museum collections. But the computer programmer says he's not tempted to trade in his high-tech job to become a full-time fossil hunter. \"Pretty much all I know is sauropods ? in fact pretty much all I know is sauropod mid-dorsal vertebrae,\" he says.

So are we doomed or is there a more mundane explanation? The Sun is no longer the largest object in the Solar System: that honour has fallen temporarily to a previously innocuous comet. The comet, called 17P Holmes, shot to prominence in late October when its brightness suddenly  increased roughly a million-fold  . Since then, both its size and its profile have grown ? earlier this month astronomers at the University of Hawaii Institute for Astronomy declared that its diameter had outstripped that of our Sun. Many ancient cultures interpreted comets as portents of doom.  Nature News  asks if we should be worried.  \n              Aren't comets supposed to be small? \n            It seems ridiculous that the titanic Sun could be dwarfed by a comet. Comets are typically referred to as 'dirty snowballs' tumbling through space, and for good reason. Most comets that swing by Earth are from the Oort Cloud ? a distant band of dust and ice at the limit of the Solar System ? and so are composed of ice and dry ice (frozen carbon dioxide) bound up with dust and small chunks of rubble. They are usually just a few kilometres wide, and zoom past planets on their travels.  The rocky core of 17P Holmes, called its nucleus, is thought to be only 3.6 kilometres across ? although because it is 240 million kilometres away, not even the Hubble Space Telescope can see it in enough detail to measure this accurately.  \n              So in what way is 17P Holmes bigger than the Sun? \n            Though its core is small, this comet has a huge 'coma' ? a spherical cloud of icy particles surrounding it. Estimates by Rachel Stevenson and her colleagues at the Hawaii observatory now estimate the diameter of the coma to be 1.4 million kilometres ? just edging past the Sun, with a diameter of 1.39 million kilometres.  \n              How did that happen? \n            The answer may well be linked to the comet's mysterious boost in brightness, suggests comet expert Paul Roche of Cardiff University, UK. Many comets are coated with a sooty layer of carbon, which absorbs light. But in Holmes's case, this may have fractured and split, releasing the highly reflective ice inside. This release of ice would have boosted both the comet's brightness and its size, as the icy particles float out from the rocky nucleus.  \n              Why hasn't the Solar System's gravity gone crazy? \n            Relax, the Sun is still by far the most massive body in the Solar System (it contains more than 99.8% of all the system's mass). Although huge in diameter, 17P Holmes's gravitational field is negligible in comparison. \"It?s just a few snowflakes per cubic metre,\" Roche says ? a far cry from the super-dense, raging nuclear inferno of the Sun.  \n              So how is this comet holding together? \n            It isn't really. The ice is falling away from the comet's core, and as the coma gets bigger it also gets more dispersed. Eventually it will get so big and spread out that it won't even be discernible as belonging to the comet anymore.  \n              Is 17P Holmes dominating the sky? \n            Not exactly dominating, although it is visible as a fuzzy 'star' in the northeastern skies, and should continue to be large and bright for weeks, if not months.  \n              Has this sort of thing happened before? \n            Yes, but generally only with the largest comets, such as Hale-Bopp, which grew even bigger than 17P Holmes when it passed close to the Sun in 1997. According to the European Southern Observatory, it reached more than 2 million kilometres across. Comet Halley also broke the 1.3-million-kilometre mark in 1988, they say. Holmes Comet itself has been seen to burst in brightness before. In November 1892 and January 1893 it displayed a 'double burst' ? although the Hawaii astronomers describe the current ongoing burst as \"unprecedented\".  \n              Why is Holmes doing this now? \n            It's very difficult to say what triggered this outburst, Roche admits. \"Comets are tumbling through space, flexing and rolling,\" he says. \"They're undergoing lots of stresses and strains, and they're very porous ? they're more like Swiss cheese than a solid ice cube, so bits can easily crack and flake off.\" It is also possible that an interaction with the Sun's 'weather' ? a stream of radiation flowing from the Sun ? could have triggered the comet to bloom in brightness. And it is now showing signs of developing a tail, as many comets do when their comas begin to be buffeted backwards by the Sun's rays.  \n              How long will it last? \n            Also difficult to say. The Hawaii team estimates that it's still expanding at a staggering 0.5 kilometres every second. But Roche points out that, the more it grows, the more its mass dwindles as its ice drifts off into space or gets left behind. \"It's shedding mass all the time,\" he says. \"It may just fade away and become a normal, unspectacular comet again.\" Some porous, rocky bodies in the Solar System are thought to be the rocky corpses of comets that have lost all their mass. Others, such as Shoemaker-Levy 9, are ripped apart when they stray too close to other huge bodies such as Jupiter. And some comets just die a mundane death, Roche says: \"Every now and then they just fall apart, almost as if they're dying of old age.\" \n                   More on comets  \n                 \n                   Space and astronomy \n                 \n                   More on Comet 17P Holmes  \n                 Reprints and Permissions"},

A native Hawaiian bird has surprised researchers with its ability to survive malaria, apparently thanks to a number of resistant populations that have spread throughout the Hawaiian forest. The discovery hints that genes for natural resistance to the avian disease may lurk inside the genomes of many of Hawaii?s endangered birds. It has long been thought that avian malaria would spell the end for the remaining native birds on Hawaii, which have faced multiple onslaughts.  First there were the Hawaiians themselves, who arrived more than 1,000 years ago and, through hunting, sent most of the ground-dwelling species the way of the dodo. Then there were the rats, cats and mongooses, brought by Europeans, that ate birds and their eggs. Diseases such as avian pox followed. Avian malaria, which arrived some 60 years ago, is one in a long line of plagues. ?We really thought that malaria would be the final nail in the coffin,? says Jeffrey Foster of Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, an author on the new study. Two years ago, researchers reported that one species, the amakihi ( Hemignathus virens ), was making a miraculous recovery in the most heavily malaria-infested forests. Now a genetic study showing how these common songbirds have managed this gives some hope for other birds.  \n              High and dry \n            More than 20 Hawaiian bird species are shielded from the disease because they live at high elevation near the tops of volcanoes, where it is too cold for the malaria parasite and the mosquitoes that carry it to survive. The amakihi is one of only a few species that has populations at both high elevation and in lowland forests. When researchers discovered that the amakihi were recovering, they thought that, after being wiped out in the forests, amakihi from the higher elevations on the volcanoes were dispersing downslope into the forests to take advantage of the empty space.  A team led by Robert Fleischer of the Smithsonian Institution in Washington DC has shown that this is not the case.  The researchers analysed the genetics of 283 amakihi individuals found in the forests between 2001 and 2003, and report in  Molecular Ecology 1  that these lowland birds are genetically very different from the volcano dwellers. ?This important study clearly shows that source populations at high altitude were not involved in the recovery, but rather that the new lowland amakihi represent the remnants of the old population that was almost wiped out,? says ecologist Eric VanderWerf of Pacific Rim Conservation, an environmental consultancy based in Honolulu.  \n              Inside solution \n            The research also shows that the forest amakihi are sufficiently different from one another to suggest that the resistance is not due to just one resistant individual that spread its genes, but rather that there were several isolated amakihi populations with resistant individuals that have thrived and spread. This, says Fleischer, suggests that the needed gene or genes were already present, if at low frequency, in the amakihi genome, rather than being the result of a new mutation. That's good news. All of the native Hawaiian birds share a common ancestor of a finch that landed on the Hawaiian isles some five million years ago. So if the amakihi genome contains genes for malaria resistance, other modern species should, too. ?We really hope that we can find the gene or genes responsible for the resistance in the amakihi and then track down these genes in other species,? says Fleischer. As a last-ditch resort in saving the birds, selective breeding could be used to boost the frequency of these genes in other populations. But the birds must still face other challenges. As global temperatures rise, malaria-bearing mosquitoes are climbing up the volcanoes. And feral cats and rats, as well as habitat destruction, are still rife. Getting those under control, says Foster, is the first and most important step to conservation. \n                   The Hawaii Ecosystems at Risk project \n                 \n                   USGS: Pacific Island Ecosystems Research Center  \n                 Reprints and Permissions"},

How, exactly, does a bat shoot sonar beams out of its nose? Rolf M\u00a3ller, a computational physicist at Shandong University in Jinan, China, has combed the caves of Southeast Asia to find out. \u201cWe are looking at different species to understand their physical tricks,\u201d says M\u00a3ller, who models the way that bat noses act like antenna, and how their ears work as dishes to collect sound.  The work matters not just to biophysicists who want to understand how animals evolve complex systems, but also to roboticists trying to find new ways of navigating in situations in which light sensors don?t work so well, including at night or underwater. Few biophysical studies of bat noses have been done. One researcher bent back a bat?s noseleaf ? the complex structure surrounding its nostrils ? to see what would happen; another scientist smeared the delicate structures with petroleum jelly. Both procedures messed up the bats? navigation. To get a better picture of what?s going on in a bat nose, M\u00a3ller took X-ray scans of the face of a Rufous horseshoe bat ( Rhinolophus rouxii ), compiling scans to build a three-dimensional computer model of the nose cavities. He then shot sound waves of differing frequencies through the modelled nose to see where they resonated, and how they were emitted from the noseleaf. High frequency sounds, M\u00a3ller found, resonated in a structure in the middle-back of the nose called the sella, and were emitted from the noseleaf as a narrowly focused beam. Low-frequency sounds resonated in a cavity called the lancet, at the top of the noseleaf. Furrows in the lancet created four secondary sound sources, so that sonar was emitted from a total of six sources, rather than just the two nostril holes. ?It widens the beam ? you have a wider array and you can splash the sound around better,? says M\u00a3ller. The study was published in  Physical Review E . The wide beam might be useful for general navigation, M\u00a3ller says. A tighter shot of sonar would be better for chasing prey or avoiding specific objects, for instance.  \n              Robo nose \n            Sonar has long been used as a basic navigational tool in robots. Making a noise and listening for its reflection with a microphone can help to determine distances to objects and their locations.  Sonar is generally slower to interpret and less precise than computer vision or laser sensors. But that?s a problem that bats have managed to work around, says Herbert Peremans, a roboticist at the University of Antwerp in Belgium. ?They clearly don?t suffer from this problem. They fly in fairly complicated environments, and they have targets that try to escape from them.? Peremans has already incorporated the other half of M\u00a3ller?s work ? modelling bat ears ? into his robots. He has fixed two nylon plastic ears, inspired by the bat work, several centimetres apart on a robot?s head. He?s trying to show that, with the proper software, he can use these ears to locate objects precisely. The next step would be to refine the sonar source with a design based on M\u00a3ller?s model noseleafs.  Peremans says that there are plenty of possible applications in ultrasound diagnostics or for mobile robots in unusual conditions. So there should be demand for M\u00a3ller?s catalogue of ears and noses. M\u00a3ller says that there are thousands of bat species that he?s hoping to analyse one by one.  Getting the bats can be the easy part, he adds. He was recently at a restaurant in Cambodia that was serving fruit-bat soup; he bought a carcass and returned to China with the ears. He was worried about explaining his cargo to customs officials, but after he showed them the ears, he says, they told him not to bother them with something so trivial. Reprints and Permissions"},

Prehistoric purveyors of jade spread their trade from a single Taiwanese source throughout a huge area of Southeast Asia, possibly bringing Austronesian languages with them. From as early as 3000 BC people from Southeast Asia used jade to make tools and ornaments. This later included ear pendants, such as a three-pointed jade ornament called a lingling-o. These ornaments have been found in southeastern Taiwan, and also all the way out to the Philippines, eastern Malaysia, southern Vietnam, central and southern Thailand, and parts of Cambodia. Hsiao-Chun Hung, at the Australian National University in Canberra, and her colleagues took a close look at lingling-o and other pendants found in archaeological digs across Southeast Asia, to find out where they came from. Rather than focus on the style and patterning on the ornaments, Hung used an electron probe microscope, which can work out the elemental composition of each sample without causing any damage. This is the first time that the technique has been used to look at jade, says Hung.  Her work shows that 116 of 144 jade ornaments from across the 3,000-kilometre-wide region came from the Fengtian jade deposit in eastern Taiwan. The Fengtian samples included incomplete ornaments and cast-off pieces of jade thought to come from the manufacturing process, which leads Hung to suggest that the jade was transported as a raw material. ?This of course implies movement of people and technology,? says Hung. Her findings are published in  Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. 1   \n              Roaming craftsmen \n            Hung suggests that the raw jade was carried by a few highly proficient, but itinerant, jade workers, who would set up camp and carve it into the lingling-o shapes preferred by the locals.  Finished ornaments were more commonly dated from 500 BC to 500 AD, when there was a flurry in trading activity in the region, and so more chance for a skilled jade worker to travel.  It was already known that obsidian was traded widely across Southeast Asia. Hung suggests that this trading carried language with it. Today, Austronesian languages are spoken by about 350 million people in Southeast Asia and Oceania. The languages are thought to have started spreading as a people migrated from Taiwan to the Philippines 4,000 years ago. And the distribution of these languages closely mirrors the distribution of Fengtian jade, says Hung.  Fengtian jade and the Austronesian Cham language are both found in southern Vietnam, for example, but not in northern Vietnam ? even though northern Vietnam is closer to the Fengtian source. Nicole Boivin, from the Leverhulme Centre for Human Evolutionary Studies at the University of Cambridge, UK, says that although trade was already widespread in this region at the time in question, using systematic scientific techniques, such as the electron probe microscope, has allowed Hung and her team to get a more detailed picture of what is happening.  ?It?s great using scientific methodology to look at this methodically,? says Boivin, ?They have really shown in great detail that something is going on.? \n                   Ecology and Evolution news \n                 Reprints and Permissions"},

The world?s most critically endangered marine mammal ? a porpoise that lives off the western coast of Mexico ? is closer to extinction than previously believed, says a new study. Only an estimated 150 individuals of the species, called a vaquita, survive in its sole habitat in the upper Gulf of California, according to an article 1  published online this week in  Conservation Biology . Researchers and environmental groups are launching a multinational drive to save the remaining animals. ?This is the best political opportunity we have ever had to try to save them,? says co-author Lorenzo Rojas-Bracho, a marine mammalogist in Ensenada, Mexico. ?If it doesn?t work, the vaquita will go extinct.? There is roughly a two-year window in which to save the animal, the team estimates. The vaquita ( Phocoena sinus ) frequently becomes entangled in the nets of fishing boats. In 1999, researchers estimated 2  there were 567 vaquitas left in the northern Gulf of California. Mexican biologist Armando Jaramillo-Legorreta, lead author of the new report, says that the rising number of fishing boats is killing the porpoises at a rate of at least 40 a year. A population of about 100 must be saved for sufficient genetic diversity, the team says. Previous attempts to create no-fishing zones and buy out fishermen in the vaquita's habitat have failed. But now the environmental groups WWF, Nature Conservancy and Conservation International have joined forces in a $10 million pledge. In the short term they will use the funds to buy up boats and nets that kill the vaquita, while also seeking to develop more sustainable fishing practices. The Mexican government has also allocated about $4 million this year for the vaquita, including developing alternative economic opportunities for local fishermen. Mexico's president, Felipe Calder\u00a3n Hinojosa, has joined the push to save the animal. But fishing industry advocates sometimes speak openly of wiping it out.  The vaquita's plight echoes that of other marine mammals. Last year, for instance, an international team of researchers declared the Chinese river dolphin, the baiji ( Lipotes vexillifer ), extinct in the Yangtze River, after a belated effort to save it. But the vaquita rescue is different, researchers say, because the upper Gulf of California remains a relatively healthy ecosystem ? unlike the polluted and heavily trafficked Yangtze. ?The problem is known, and a remedy is available,? says Barbara Taylor, a co-author on the article who is a mammalogist at the US Southwest Fisheries Science Center in La Jolla, California. ?The question is whether there is the political will to make it happen.?  Earlier programmes to alter fishing practices in the region have proven difficult to implement; last year, $1 million from the government that ostensibly paid regional fishermen not to fish instead went to buy new boats and motors, scientists say. This year, the Mexican government is allocating about $1 million to help enforce the no-fishing regulations. Conservation agencies are also supporting the effort.  For the long term, economic researchers at the Mexican National Ecological Institute in Mexico City, and the Sustainable Fisheries Group at the University of California at Santa Barbara, are studying how to provide alternative opportunities for the fishermen. ?We want to introduce incentive-based fishing management,? says biologist Susan Anderson, director of the Nature Conservancy?s northern Mexico programme.  Whether that is enough to save the vaquita remains to be seen. \n                   Vaquita.org \n                 \n                   The extinct baiji \n                 Reprints and Permissions"},

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) ? the United Nations body that last month won the Nobel Prize for its efforts to boost understanding of climate change ? has raised the tone of urgency with its latest report. Its new synthesis report, which aims to give policy-makers a concise summary of the findings of all three of its detailed research summaries released earlier this year, is notable for containing more pressing language relative to earlier output. Featured in the report is a discussion of \"dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system\" ? a phrase that was absent from previous IPCC publications because of objections from some political delegates to the panel's conferences. \"Delayed emission reductions significantly constrain the opportunities? and increase the risk of more severe climate change impacts,\" the report says. (See  'Five messages from the IPCC' ) Although the IPCC declares that its job is merely to describe the science of climate change, and not to advocate policies aimed at tackling it, the new report is likely to be viewed as a call to arms ahead of important negotiations on a potential successor to the Kyoto Protocol.  Signatories to the Kyoto treaty are meeting next month in Bali, Indonesia, to discuss a follow-up pact to the carbon-cutting agreement, which remains the most comprehensive existing plan for fighting climate change.  \n              Going up \n            The new report condenses the findings of the three longer reports, and is published as the IPCC's Fourth Assessment Report, entitled 'Climate Change 2007'. Broadly, the three publications discuss the scale of climate change, its likely effects on the world, and the ways and means in which it can be tackled. The new report, released in Valencia, Spain, by UN secretary-general Ban Ki-moon, confirms again that it is at least 90% certain that rising temperatures are caused by mankind's activities. It lays out possible strategies for avoiding world temperature rises. Successfully limiting the impact of such climate change will involve 'mitigation' strategies, such as emissions trading, and 'adaptation', such as installing improved flood defences, the report says.  \n              Worst case scenario \n            Although the report is limited only to material within the three previous publications, the tone has toughened, perhaps because research published in the interim has suggested that world greenhouse emissions are matching or even exceeding the gloomiest predictions of the IPCC's previous output. Recent research, for example, shows that the 'carbon intensity' of the global economy ? the amount of greenhouse gas emitted per unit of economic productivity ? is climbing, mostly as a result of the coal-dependence of China and other emerging nations (see  Greenhouse-gas levels accelerating ). Previously, economic analysts had not expected such a trend. \"The predictions for any given emissions scenario are likely to be underestimates ? the most benign view ? of future change,\" says Bob Spicer, an earth scientist at the UK's Open University. \"Those areas undergoing most rapid change now (the Arctic and continental interiors) are likely to be where the biggest errors in the predictions lie.\" Hans Verolme, head of the conservation group WWF's Global Climate Change programme in Washington DC, points to the existence of a section within the synthesis report called 'reasons for concern', which he says acknowledges the risk of both abrupt climatic shifts and irreversible impacts. Although there is \"a little hedging and qualifying going on\", he says, the fact that such a statement is in the report is notable.  ?The good news is the report also says we have a small window of opportunity to take decisive action,? Verolme says, suggesting that politicians now have all of the evidence and analysis they need to pursue cuts in greenhouse-gas emissions in Bali next month. ?The IPCC shows us that those cuts need to be not small, but deep.? \n                   More on climate change  \n                 \n                   More on the IPCC  \n                 \n                   Draft Synthesis Report  \n                 \n                   Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change  \n                 \n                   WWF Climate Change Program \n                 Reprints and Permissions"},

Can the pharmaceutical industry be trusted to fund doctors' compulsory education without introducing bias? The issue is dividing Congress, academics and drugs companies. Now, preliminary data have emerged suggesting that industry-sponsored courses skew training material in favour of commercial interests. Pharmaceutical firms spend over US$1 billion a year to fund more than half of the continuing medical education (CME) courses that qualified physicians are required to take in the United States. Although drug firms say that they are scrupulous about separating their CME involvement from promotional activities, some may be influencing doctors, intentionally or not, and may even be putting patients' health at risk (see ' Smokescreens '). Drug companies deny this, insisting that the independent educational firms they pay to produce CME activities always operate outside industry influence. Government standards specify that commercial promotion must be kept separate from education. Now, two small studies have attempted the first objective measurements of bias in doctors' education. Neither is large enough to settle the issue (and neither has yet been published), but their data suggest that industry sponsorship is distorting medical education. Psychiatrist Jatinder Takhar, head of the CME office at the University of Western Ontario in London, Canada, first became interested in industry bias after attending a CME presentation on antipsychotic drugs that she had audited and approved previously. She was surprised to find that it did not match her recollection. \"The data were slanted and the presentation was more promotional and less educational,\" she alleges. Takhar and her colleagues went on to develop a standardized checklist of potential problems to be used for measuring bias in CME, which they published in June (J. Takhar  et al .  J. Cont. Educ. Health Prof.   27 , 118-123; 2007). The team then applied its checklist to 17 company-sponsored CME events. Nine of these were found to be biased and should not have been approved, Takhar says. Some focused only on the sponsors' product and ignored rival treatments. In others, information on side effects associated with the sponsors' drugs was reduced to small print. Another study, by Daniel Carlat, a psychiatrist at Tufts University School of Medicine in Somerville, Massachusetts, looked at printed CME material \u2014 typically, medical articles followed by a written test. Carlat asked his colleagues to remove information about the sponsor from exercises sent to his office during 2005 and 2006. He then calculated the ratio of positive to negative statements made about every drug mentioned in the exercises. In 14 of the 15 exercises he looked at, the drug that received the highest ratio turned out to have been made by the firm sponsoring that exercise. He is preparing his paper for submission to the  American Journal of Psychiatry . Carlat publishes a CME newsletter that operates independently of industry funding, presenting a conflict of interest to his study. Researchers shown the findings of the two studies by  Nature  add that the samples Carlat looked at might not be representative of all written CME exercises. They also note that, unlike Takhar, Carlat has not validated his method for estimating bias. Drug companies also point out that firms tend to sponsor material about disorders for which they sell the best treatment, so it is right that those exercises focus on the sponsors' drugs. Yet interviews with physicians involved in the exercises that Carlat evaluated reveal that, at least in some cases, the focus is not simply the result of sponsors' drugs outperforming those of their rivals. One exercise Carlat looked at was based on talks on bipolar disorder given at the 2005 US Psychiatric and Mental Health Congress. Anton Porsteinsson of the University of Rochester Medical Center in New York gave one of the presentations. Porsteinsson alleges that he mentioned problems with a sponsor's drug \u2014 Depakote (divalproex), manufactured by Abbott Laboratories in Illinois \u2014 in his talk, but that these were missing from the exercise. Yet he claims that positive results about the drug that were not mentioned during the talk were included. In his opinion, \"the big issue is that the article is selective\". Abbott denies claims that the presentation was distorted. A spokeswoman says that the firm had reviewed the material and found it to be in line with current thinking on bipolar disorder. When asked about Carlat and Takhar's findings, Jennifer Page, communications director at the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America in Washington DC, said only that drug companies do adhere to her organization's CME guidelines. Those standards require a firewall between pharmaceutical firms and medical-education companies. Drug companies can recommend speakers for events, for example, but CME providers select the physicians best suited for the job and are not obliged to follow a sponsor's suggestions.   But the firewall is not working, some argue. As other forms of promotion are scaled back, marketing is increasingly disguised as education, says Jerome Kassirer, a former editor of the  New England Journal of Medicine , now at Tufts University in Medford, Massachusetts. \"It's a reallocation of marketing money,\" he says. One physician who was employed by a drug company to check the accuracy of promotional material, and who asked to remain anonymous, claims that CME material is still viewed by drug companies as part of marketing campaigns. He adds that the provider-sponsor firewall is easy to subvert, because CME providers do not need to be explicitly told to produce biased programmes. \"They know that if they don't provide what the company wants then they're never going to be hired again,\" he claims.  The Accreditation Council for Continuing Medical Education (ACCME), based in Chicago, Illinois, which approves CME providers, acknowledges that more could be done to protect against bias. Murray Kopelow, the council's chief executive, says that next year the ACCME will launch a trial in which reviewers will check CME material and report back on problems they encounter. The council will also consider whether drug companies could be asked to pool CME funds for distribution by an independent body in a bid to reduce the influence that any one firm has over an educational exercise. \n                   Danny Carlat's blog \n                 \n                   Accreditation Council for Continuing Medical Education  \n                 \n                   Report on CME by the Senate finance committee \n                 Reprints and Permissions"},

Scientists have designed tiny robots that can mingle with a social group of cockroaches and influence their behaviour. They say that similar robots will help them to unpick the decision-making processes in other gregarious species that carry out 'collective behaviours' such as deciding where to rest or selecting food sources. The researchers report their studies in today?s  Science 1 . Unlike ants and bees, cockroaches do not have a sophisticated social structure, but they do take notice of what their fellows are doing. Last year Jos\u00a3 Halloy, a theoretical biologist at the Free University of Brussels, Belgium, reported that when cockroaches have a choice of two or more shelters under which to settle, their decision is influenced by the number of cockroaches already there 2 . In that study, the researchers placed up to a hundred cockroaches in an arena and found they were more likely to stop at one shelter if another cockroach was already there ? and highly likely to stop if several were there. This accelerating pace of social gathering stopped sharply when the shelter became full ? the cockroaches sensed the overcrowding and scurried elsewhere (similar to how tourists might behave when selecting which restaurant to eat at on a busy street). The scientists deduced the straightforward, but non-linear, mathematical relationship influencing an individual cockroach?s decision to follow or deviate from its general inclination to shelter in the dark.  \n              Lured inside \n            For the new study, Halloy commissioned colleagues at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne, Switzerland, to make cockroach-size robots based on this algorithm. His team built a simple one-metre diameter plastic arena containing two 155-centimetre diameter shelters, like beach umbrellas, for a series of trials on a community of four robots and 12 cockroaches. One shelter was darker than the other. First they had to make the robots ? which the cockroaches initially ignored or avoided ? accepted members of the cockroach community. Because the insects recognize each other through the pheromones they release, the scientists collected the odorous chemicals from males and wrapped the robots in blotting paper containing a drop equivalent to the scent of one cockroach. So treated, they were accepted as fellow insects. Cockroaches are nocturnal and so always prefer to rest in the dark, a tactic that keeps them out the way of predators such as humans. When the robots were programmed to have the same preference for darker corners, the real insects congregated in the dark shelter in three-quarters of the trials.  But when the robots were programmed to prefer light places, the insects congregated in the lighter shelter in about 60% of trials. The presence of just a few robots with contrary 'instincts' was enough to override the natural preferences of cockroaches, notes Halloy.  He adds that the robots were also occasionally led by the real insects: about 40% of the time they found themselves in a place they were programmed not to like the light conditions of, since they too were inclined to join popular shelters. \"The robots and the cockroaches were influencing each other,\" Halloy says (see  video ).  \n              Social studies \n            ?We are starting to realise how much social interaction there is among insects and this study shows that robotics can help us understand them better,? comments Roland Strauss, an insect biologist from the University of Mainz in Germany, who has developed robot fruitflies for his research on neuronal control of movement. But before anyone gets ideas that group behaviour of troublesome insects such as swarming locusts might be diverted by a few judiciously designed robo-insects, Halloy cautions that robotic technologies are not advanced enough to make such real-world applications possible in the foreseeable future. Even using cockroach-scented decoys to lure insects into a trap wouldn't work, since live insects would notice if the other insects inside a shelter were dead. Halloy has nothing ? much ? against cockroaches. \"They are very kind, not aggressive and they don?t bite. They are just a bit disgusting,\" he says.  He is nevertheless moving on to work on chickens, another gregarious species that displays collective behaviours. The robotics required for this more complex species will have to be more sophisticated, he admits. He plans to get his future robo-chickens accepted by the brood by exploiting maternal imprinting, a phenomenon whereby a newly hatched chick will follow the first moving object it sees. Usually that is its mother, but it will settle for a robot if that's all that circumstances allow. \n                   Halloy home page \n                 Reprints and Permissions"},

The textbook rule that says activated human genes almost always express both of their copies ? the one inherited from mum and that inherited from dad ? seems not to be true. Instead, a good chunk of our genome could prefer the 'single life', according to new research. Whether the maternal or paternal copy gets switched on in such cases seems to be random. But the result could have a big impact on disease susceptibility and other biological traits. It had been thought that there are only a handful of situations in which just one of a pair of gene copies is used. But a new screen of 4,000 human genes has uncovered 371 that sometimes play favourites, suggesting that this phenomenon is far more pervasive than had been thought. ?What we?ve shown violates general rules about what we think about genes: if a gene is turned on you express both the maternal and paternal copy,? says Andrew Chess, a biologist at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, who led the study along with colleague Alexander Gimelbrant. This kind of selective gene expression could create an extra source of variation between people, even when some of their genes are identical. ?I like the idea that we're all mosaics, and this might contribute to differences,? says Steve Henikoff, a biologist at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, Washington.  \n              Coalition of the expressed \n            Researchers have long known that some cells express just one version of certain genes, but this is for a specific purpose. Females have two X chromosomes but always shut down one copy, for example, to prevent making a double dose of some gene products. Immune cells designed to recognize the fingerprint of a specific disease turn off one set of immunoglobulin genes to optimize their specialist behaviour. And during development, embryos chemically flag one parent?s version of a set of known genes for silencing. This handful of instances accounts for hundreds of genes known to turn off a copy in a controlled way. To hunt for more genes that behave similarly, Chess and Gimelbrant planted single human immune cells in dishes, and let the cells multiply. They analysed the millions of cell copies using a gene chip to distinguish between the maternal and paternal version of messenger RNA (mRNA) produced by 3,939 genes. They found that about 9% of the genes sometimes turned on just one copy. They publish their findings today in  Science 1 . Even though the cells were all genetically identical, some turned on maternal versions, some paternal, and others activated both. \"Even identical twins would make different choices,\" says Gimelbrant. The team noticed a similar pattern in a much smaller subset of genes that they examined from specimens of donated human placenta and white blood cells. ?This is not something weird that happens only in cell culture,? says Chess. Nor does it happen only in immune cells, although the researchers' further work on other cell types has not yet been published.  \n              Sloppy genome \n            These differences could potentially help an organism to regulate gene expression and affect disease risk. Higher expression of a gene called  APP  is linked to early onset of Alzheimer?s disease, for example. And Chess?s team found that cells in which just one copy of  APP  was turned on made about half as much mRNA as the cells with both copies turned on. At this point, the connection to Alzheimer?s remains speculative, he says. The random gene inactivation that Chess's team has found could be a spillover from more controlled forms of silencing, such as shutting down an X chromosome, says Huntington Willard, a geneticist at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina. \"I tend not to think of it as some grand evolutionary plan, but simply as the sloppiness of gene regulation.\"  Chess doesn?t know just when cells switch off a gene copy, but he suspects it happens during development. Unanswered, too, is how the cells turn off one copy while keeping the second copy active. Chess?s lab is now digging into this question. The team next plans to survey the rest of humanity's 20,000 genes for signs of similar deactivation. If his team?s sample is representative of the whole genome, more than 1,000 genes should sometimes go it alone. \n                   Chess Lab \n                 Reprints and Permissions"},

Research on slumbering rats has shed light on how the brain processes its recent experiences into long-term memories. The experiment suggests that the brain creates such memories by 'playing back' the day's events several times faster than they actually happened. The study, carried out by neuroscientists at the University of Arizona in Tucson, boosts the theory that the brain region responsible for organizing long-term recall, known as the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), consolidates memory by playing back events during sleep. It also shows that the brain is quicker at re-running these events than it is at actually performing them. The researchers, led by Bruce McNaughton, trained two rats to run to a series of different locations within an area during 50-minute activity sessions. After the task, they allowed the rats to sleep for up to an hour. During the experiment, the researchers monitored the activity of selected brain cells in the rats' mPFC. While performing the task, the cells showed a characteristic pattern of activity. During the subsequent sleep, the same cells showed the same patterns, but at a higher speed. During sleep, the rats' brain replayed this characteristic activity at roughly six or seven times the original speed, McNaughton and his colleagues report in this week's  Science 1 .  \n              Fast-forward \n            The observed playback is consistent with the role of the mPFC in long-term memory storage. Very recent experiences are recalled with the help of a brain structure called the hippocampus, and neuroscientists think that, during sleep, memories are 'transferred' from short-term hippocampal storage to the longer-term repository in the mPFC. Accelerated playback has been seen in other brain regions linked to memory, including the hippocampus. But this is the first time it has been seen in the prefrontal cortex, says Matthew Wilson, a neurobiologist at Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge. \"It puts the prefrontal cortex firmly into the picture of coordinated memory processing during sleep,\" he says. It's not clear why the brain replays events faster than they actually happened, McNaughton and his colleauges admit. They suggest that the pathways made up by connections between brain cells may have an intrinsic speed that results from the movement of electrical signals through them and that the brain has to 'slow down' when working under the constraints of having to perform actual behaviours. \"I think that's a very compelling idea,\" agrees Wilson. The observed bursts of replay in the rat brains lasted just a few hundred milliseconds each, suggesting that the rodents' brains were playing back tiny chunks of their experience and processing them into small packages of memory.  \n              While you were sleeping \n            Similar processes almost certainly occur in the human brain during sleep, says Wilson, and may even be linked to dreaming. \"I believe these phenomena are directly correlated with dream-like states that humans report,\" he adds. It is not usually possible to investigate the sleeping human brain in as much detail as in rats, because of ethical considerations. But Wilson expects that, as both rat brain studies and human sleep research improve, the gap between the two will be closed.  \"In human sleep studies it's difficult to see what is going on, but it's possible to see the consequences of sleep-related activities,\" Wilson says. But he thinks that \"there is an overlap - I see there being convergence, and I see there being consistency\" between what goes on inside human and rat brains as they slumber. \n                   Brain and behaviour \n                 \n                   University of Arizona neuroscience \n                 \n                   MIT Brain and Cognitive Sciences \n                 Reprints and Permissions"},

Two much-anticipated scientific firsts announced this week bring the dream of regenerative medicine a step closer. The production of cloned primate embryonic stem cells and the reprogramming of adult human cells both represent important milestones in the quest to produce 'pluripotent' cells, which can develop into almost any of the body's roughly 200 cell types. Human embryonic stem cells have this property, and those used in research are usually extracted from leftover embryos created during  in vitro  fertilization. But researchers want to create pluripotent cells that are genetically matched to individual patients. Such cells could then be transplanted to treat disorders such as Parkinson's disease and diabetes, or be used by researchers to model disease progression. Cloning offers one way to create these cells. This week, a team led by Shoukhrat Mitalipov of Oregon Health & Science University in Beaverton report the first creation of embryonic stem cells from cloned monkey embryos (see page 497). Until now, cloned embryonic stem cells had been created only in mice. The accomplishment in primates is \"like breaking the sound barrier\", says Robert Lanza, of Los Angeles-based biotech company Advanced Cell Technology. The creation in 1996 of the first cloned animal, Dolly the sheep, led to a rapid succession of clones. But continued failure to achieve cloned human or monkey embryos resulted in pessimism.  In 2003, primate-cloning researcher Gerald Schatten said: \"With current approaches, NT [nuclear transfer, a cloning technique] to produce embryonic stem cells in nonhuman primates may prove difficult ? and reproductive cloning unachievable 1 .\" This was after his study involving 716 monkey eggs failed to produce a single clone. Then, in February 2004, Woo Suk Hwang, then of Seoul National University in Korea, announced that he had created cloned human embryonic stem cells 2 . But, in January 2006, those results were shown to have been faked, and some suspected that Schatten was right. Mitalipov's group had been trying for almost a decade to achieve reproductive cloning in monkeys, and used some 15,000 eggs in the process. After Hwang's results turned out to be fraudulent, the researchers decided to switch from reproductive cloning to trying to establish a cloned embryonic stem-cell line. They took skin cells from Semos, a nine-year-old rhesus macaque, and inserted the cells' nuclei into eggs that had had their own genetic material removed. By January 2007, they had a cell line that retained its embryonic pluripotency ? and, a couple of months later, another. Mitalipov credits their success to a US$19,000 imaging machine, named Oosight, which allows the structures in the egg that hold the DNA to be clearly seen, enabling easy extraction ? the first step in nuclear transfer. Previously, researchers used a dye named Hoechst combined with ultraviolet light to locate and remove an egg's DNA. But Mitalipov's group found that this method damaged the egg. Mitalipov says that his group's technique should work in human cells: \"There's nothing specific here. But you must use this kind of imaging system,\" he says.  Reproductive cloning in monkeys, though, still looks to be a long way off. In April, after creating the two cell lines, Mitalipov's team tried transferring 77 embryos created into about a dozen surrogates. All failed to create pregnancies. In the aftermath of the Hwang fraud,  Nature  has taken the unusual step of having these results independently verified by a team at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia 3 . \"The scientific community has a need to have some certainty in the outcomes of nucleartransfer experiments given the recent unfortunate experience with human somatic-cell nuclear transfer. We have total confidence in these conclusions,\" says Alan Trounson, a member of the Monash team. Many scientists are hesitant to apply the technique in humans because it requires women to undergo an uncomfortable procedure that involves significant health risks. Altogether, Mitalipov's team used 304 eggs to produce the two primate embryonic stemcell lines. The researchers still have little idea of what separates the majority failures from the rare successes, so a similar number of eggs would probably be required to establish human lines.  \n              Avoiding controversy \n            \"The basic science of this is important,\" says John Gearhart, director of the Stem Cell Program at Johns Hopkins Medicine in Baltimore, Maryland. \"But the low frequency of success here is troubling ? particularly when considering human work.\"  But there is another promising route to creating pluripotent cells that does not require eggs or the controversial destruction of embryos. On Tuesday, Shinya Yamanaka of the University of Kyoto in Japan reported that his team had created pluripotent cells from human skin cells 4  and, on the same day, a team of researchers led by James Thomson at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, reported the same 5 . Yamanaka's work builds on his exciting discovery last year that introducing four transcription factors into mouse skin cells 'reprogrammed' the cells into an embryo-like state. Early this summer, Yamanaka and two other groups reported using the same four factors to create cells that seemed to be indistinguishable from embryonic stem cells 6 . Because of the basic differences between human and mouse cells, Yamanaka was surprised to find that these four factors produced the same result in humans. The team generated 10 pluripotent lines from a culture of some 50,000 facial skin cells that had been subjected to the four factors. The skin sample, provided by a company in the United States, had been taken from a 36-year-old Caucasian woman. Yamanaka repeated the exercise with cells from synovial (joint) fluid from a 69-yearold man with similar results. During culture, the pluripotent cells take on the flat shape of embryonic stem cells. Why so few cells successfully form such 'induced' pluripotent stem (iPS) cells is a mystery that Yamanaka is still trying to resolve. But because he uses such a cheap resource ? cells that can be attained in their millions from a single skin biopsy ? the low yield is not a problem, he says. In comparison to human embryonic stem cells ? after much political wrangling and laborious effort, there are only three cell lines in Japan ? his technique is prolific, Yamanaka says. \"In a little dish you can get ten cell lines quickly. Practically speaking it's a very high success rate.\" Like the mouse iPS cells, Yamanaka's human iPS cells passed all the basic tests for embryonic stem cells, including the ability to form tumours expressing the three primary germ layers when injected under the skin of a mouse engineered to have no immune system. But are they truly pluripotent? The most stringent tests, carried out in mice, are to see whether a whole individual can be created from iPS cells or whether iPS cells mixed with an embryo's are expressed in all of the resulting chimaeric mouse's tissues. Neither test can be done with human cells. \"In humans, there's no answer to the question,\" says Yamanaka. But, he adds, if the cells are for use in therapy or research on a disease affecting a particular tissue, it doesn't matter. Yamanaka's cells, for example, were able to form neurons, and cardiac muscle cells that ? after differentiating for 12 days ? started beating. But iPS cells do have drawbacks. Introduction of the four 'Yamanaka factors' requires genetic manipulation using viral vectors that health agencies would be unlikely to approve for clinical use. And one of the factors, c-myc, is thought to be responsible for tumours in mice. Thomson, who was the first to isolate and maintain human embryonic stem cells in culture, has gone part way towards solving these problems. He also used four factors, introduced by viral vectors, to reprogramme human foreskin cells. But only two of the four are the same, and he does not use c-myc. What is more, the discovery that a different recipe resulted in successful reprogramming suggests that scientists might have a greater degree of flexibility in finding clinically acceptable variations on Yamanaka's selection.  \n              Onto the home strait \n            With researchers crowding into the field, Gearhart and others anticipate rapid advancement. \"The iPS strategy is a major paradigm shift in reprogramming cells, and if proved effective and safe with human cells ? most likely coming very very soon ? it will diminish the role of somatic-cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) for deriving patient-specific pluripotent cells,\" says Gearhart.  The case for iPS-cell research and against using cloning was highlighted this weekend when the University of Edinburgh's Iam Wilmut, one of Dolly's creators, announced that he planned to turn his back on the field he pioneered in favour of research using Yamanaka's reprogramming technique. Mitalipov maintains that the egg is the only \"perfect reprogramming machine\", and is confident that cloned cells will be the first to show therapeutic value. He says he has already more than doubled the efficiency of his cloning technique. And he is preparing for the clinic. Plans are underway to create cloned embryonic cell lines from Semos and some ten other monkeys, to induce diseases such as diabetes in them, and then see if the cloned embryonic stem cells can be used to treat them. Furthermore, in a move likely to raise fresh controversy, Mitalipov this week began a collaboration with Alison Murdoch and Mary Herbert of Newcastle University, UK. Murdoch's group has a licence to work with human embryos. \"I can't just keep modelling,\" Mitalipov says. \"If we show medical progress, society will accept the technology.\" \n                   Woo Suk Hwang special \n                 \n                   Nature Reports Stem Cells \n                 \n                   Stem Cell Information: Glossary \n                 Reprints and Permissions"},

Three years after it pulled its blockbuster painkiller Vioxx from the market, Merck has agreed to pay $4.85 billion to settle nearly 27,000 lawsuits that claim the arthritis drug caused heart attacks and strokes. The settlement, although specifying that Merck \"does not admit causation or fault\", is in effect the legal expression of an admission by the company of a medical problem when it withdrew the $2.5-billion-a-year drug in September 2004 after five years on the market. It was prompted to do so when patients taking Vioxx in a Merck-sponsored clinical trial showed a doubled risk of heart attack and stroke (R. Bresalier  et al .  N. Engl. J. Med.  352, 1092-1102; 2005). At the time, the company promised to fight in court every lawsuit brought against it. The settlement agreed on 9 November is a qualified positive for Merck. The New Jersey company's Vioxx liability was initially pegged by Wall Street at tens of billions of dollars. What's more, the deal will go ahead if only 85% of eligible claimants agree to it, lowering the risk that thousands of cases will continue to drag on in court. Both sides claim victory. Plaintiffs' attorney Mark Lanier of the Lanier Law Firm in Houston, Texas, applauded the deal as \"a huge opportunity for those who have been hurt by the drug to receive a fair settlement\" and said he would counsel the 1,006 plaintiffs he represents to accept it.  Bruce Kuhlik, Merck's general counsel, called the settlement \"a product of the success that we've had in the litigation so far\". Despite a stunning $253-million judgment against Merck in the first Vioxx trial (see  Nature  436, 1070; 2005) ? later reduced to around $26 million under Texas damage law - Merck has won 11 Vioxx cases so far, whereas plaintiffs have prevailed in only 5.  Those numbers reflect the difficulty of proving causation in individual cases, regardless of the soundness of aggregate findings from large randomized clinical trials, when a drug's adverse effects ? and the risk factors that can lead to them ? are broadly and independently prevalent in the population. That helped defence lawyers persuade juries that Vioxx wasn't at fault in the heart attacks suffered by plaintiffs such as Elaine Doherty, an overweight 68-year-old with diabetes and high blood pressure.  \"What was so clever about the defence strategy is that they argued it at the individual level. It certainly drove down the estimates of how much this was going to cost them,\" says Garret FitzGerald, chair of pharmacology at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, whose mechanistic studies in humans and mice first pointed to the cardiovascular risks of Vioxx and other drugs in its class.  The Vioxx cases are in stark contrast to the lawsuits brought by people who took Fen-Phen, a popular diet-drug combination withdrawn in 1997. The signature, and relatively uncommon, heart-valve damage caused in those cases left drug-maker Wyeth liable for damages of more than $21 billion. Indeed, for scientists and clinicians, the main message of the settlement may be that reliable, personalized lawsuit victories remain as elusive as personalized medicine itself, and for many similar reasons. \n                   Cardiovascular Medicine \n                 \n                   Merck news release detailing Vioxx settlement \n                 \n                   Lanier Law firm news release on Vioxx settlement \n                 \n                   Garret FitzGerald, Chair, Department of Pharmacology, University of Pennsylvania \n                 Reprints and Permissions"},

Three-quarters of bear species are threatened with extinction according to the World Conservation Union (IUCN), a global consortium of environmental groups and government agencies. Thousands of scientists are working with the IUCN to map the threats to all land-mammal populations around the globe. Today the group released reports on seven of the world's eight bear species, to highlight the plight faced by these large mammals. Only two of these ? the Brown bear ( Ursus arctos ) and American Black bear ( Ursus americanus ) ? are relatively healthy, they say. The rest are either vulnerable or endangered (see  Box: Bear status ). Polar bears ( Ursus maritimus ) ? classed as marine mammals ? were classified as vulnerable last year. Added to the vulnerable list this year is the Sun bear ( Helarctos malayanus ), a species of small bear that lives throughout Southeast Asia. The panel estimates that Sun bear populations have fallen by nearly one-third over the past three decades. There are no hard numbers, but estimates put the population at something over 10,000. Hunting and human encroachment are the main reasons behind the declines, says Simon Stuart, a senior adviser with the Union. Bears' gall-bladders are used as a fever remedy in Chinese medicine, and their popularity has led to rampant poaching. Meanwhile, as human populations in Asia surge, bears are finding themselves confined to ever-shrinking habitats. \"At the end of the day, these species need space,\" Stuart says.  In China this week, the habitat problem is taking centre stage, as conservationists warned that Panda bears in the Sichuan province may soon face a food shortage. An unusually high number of bamboo plants in the region are flowering, which happens just before the plants die. Normally, pandas would move to a different part of the bamboo forest to supplement their diet when local forests die back. But their movement has been blocked by human activities, authorities say. A similar bamboo die-off in the 1980s led to the deaths of hundreds of pandas. \n                   The World Conservation Union \n                 Reprints and Permissions"},

The nastiest strains of  Staphyloccocus aureus deliver molecular bombs that kill immune cells, researchers have found. The protein bombs are one of the features that distinguish the more vicious strains of drug-resistant  S. aureus  that are now tearing through communities from those that have plagued hospitals for decades. The proteins ? called phenol-soluble modulins, or PSMs ? are just one of many tricks up the sleeve of drug-resistant  S. aureus.  Targeting the proteins with an anti-serum at the same time as bashing the microbes with antibiotics that still have some effect, such as vancomycin, might help to beat back the tide of rising infections.  S. aureus  has a nasty habit of being resistant to the drugs used to treat it, often with deadly results. Methicillin resistant  S. aureus (MRSA), which is also resistant to many other commonly-used drugs, causes more than 18,000 deaths in the United States every year ? eclipsing the approximately 16,000 deaths from HIV/AIDS in 2005. 1  And infections are also on the rise: in 1974, MRSA was responsible for 2% of  Staphylococcus  infections, but by 2003 that proportion had risen to 64%. Symptoms range from pimples to puss-oozing boils to pneumonia. There are different types of MRSA. Community-associated MRSA is resistant to fewer antibiotics than hospital strains are, but is more ferocious, able to fell people within days.  \n              First defence \n            Michael Otto, a microbiologist at the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Disease in Hamilton, Montana, and his colleagues were looking at the ways that MRSA can be so nasty when they discovered the PSMs: proteins 20?40 amino acids long and related to PSMs found in a species of Staph that coats our skin To determine how these molecules inflict their damage, Otto?s team made several of them in the lab and rained them onto a type of human immune cell called a neutrophil. These cells are the body?s first line of defence against  Staphylococcus  and they are key to battling infection. Within minutes these immune cells started to flatten (a sign of stress), and after an hour many were destroyed. ?This is how we think  S. aureus gets rid of its main enemies,? says Otto. Otto?s team examined a collection of hospital and community strains that had been isolated from patients, and found that several of the community strains produce lots of PSMs, while most hospital varieties made none. They concluded that this might be one of the reasons that community-based MRSA is so bad.  A second experiment confirmed this idea. Removing the genes encoding for PSMs lessened the community-based bacteria?s ability to kill lab mice, and left smaller abscesses on the skin of infected mice than usual, the group reports in  Nature Medicine 2 .  \n              Multi-pronged attack \n            Though PSMs seem to be important in understanding community-associated strains, they are one piece of a larger puzzle, says Henry Chambers, a microbiologist and physician at the University of California in San Francisco. ?It is unlikely and in fact na\u00a3ve to suspect that there's a one size fits all virulence determinant in  Staphylococcus, because they have so many,? he says. Researchers have identified other proteins and toxins produced by community-based strains that boost their infectivity (see  Research highlights nastier form of MRSA ). Otto's team is now making PSM antisera to test in mice infected with community-associated MRSA. \n                   MRSA patient information \n                 \n                   More on MRSA \n                 Reprints and Permissions"},

The parties to the London Convention, an international treaty that governs ocean pollution, have agreed that large-scale ocean ?fertilization? isn't yet justified, given gaps in scientific knowledge. The convention, which regulates activities such as the dumping of garbage at sea, had not previously taken a stand on the notion of throwing nutrients into the ocean with the intention of promoting plankton growth. Such projects have been proposed to help increase ocean productivity and thereby boost the uptake of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, combating climate change. But critics warn that little is known about the ecological effect of dumping large quantities of nutrients into the sea. At its meeting in London last week, the convention endorsed concerns issued in June by its scientific advisory group about the possible effects of large-scale fertilization activities. Representatives from 35 countries agreed that all forms of ocean fertilization should fall under the convention?s oversight. They agreed to study the issue further and create rules to govern such procedures, next year at the earliest. The rules would be binding to countries signed up to the treaty. Until then, they have urged national marine authorities to use the ?utmost caution? when considering proposals for large-scale ocean fertilization operations. Environmental groups have applauded the move. ?We certainly welcome the outcome,? says David Santillo of Greenpeace's science unit in Exeter, UK. ?This intention to regulate ocean fertilization has a lot of political weight, and the view that such operations should not proceed at this time is just the sort of clear message we had hoped for.?  \n              Blooming experiments \n            In the past, scientific experiments have created algae blooms by dumping iron or other nutrients into patches of ocean. But their findings about the rate of carbon sequestration and the effects on marine ecosystems were ambiguous. The methods have not yet been applied on a large or commercial scale. Several private companies, including Planktos, based in Foster City, California, plan to fertilize patches of the ocean with iron, with a view to generating verifiable carbon credits that could be sold on evolving global greenhouse-gas-emissions markets. The Australian company Ocean Nourishment Corporation in New South Wales is also planning to test the idea, this time using urea as a nitrogen-based fertilizer. The firm wants to dump 500 tonnes of dissolved urea in the Sulu Sea between Borneo and the Philippines.  ?We do not have a fixed date for this experiment to take place,? says John Ridley, managing director of the corporation. ?It is part of our ongoing R&D programme in demonstrating the feasibility of ocean nourishment.?

But environmentalists maintained calls for a voluntary, nation-by-nation moratorium on all fertilization operations until international regulations are in place. Many also urge other international bodies to set up rules for other acts that interfere on a large scale with the ?global commons? of air and water. ?We urge governments meeting at the United Nation?s Framework Convention on Climate Change in Bali next month to follow the London Convention?s lead and begin an international process to put all geoengineering technologies under international oversight,? says Jim Thomas of ETC, an environmental group based in Ottawa, Canada. \n                   London Convention \n                 \n                   Ocean Nourishment Corporation \n                 Reprints and Permissions"},

Biomedical research in the United States has suffered substantial adverse effects from a rule on patient privacy introduced in 2003, according to concerned scientists who conducted a survey on the subject. \"We discovered delays, excess cost, and possible lack of undertaking some research projects,\" says Roberta Ness, chair of the Department of Epidemiology at the University of Pittsburgh in Pennsylvania, and lead researcher behind the survey. \"Overall, the progress of science involving human subjects is being slowed.\" Ness told  Nature News  that she believes the public will suffer unless the rule is changed. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) privacy rule is designed to protect patients by ensuring that groups such as hospitals, pharmacies and health-insurance companies don't have total access to information, and must take steps to ensure the privacy of their records. Crucially for researchers, it allows disclosure of records for research only if the researcher in question has obtained authorization from each patient or obtained a waiver from an institutional review board. While researchers applaud the goal of protecting privacy, they say the paperwork involved with the HIPAA rule is slowing and impeding research, while not necessarily protecting patients. As an example, Ness highlights a study of preeclampsia ? a condition of hypertension occurring in pregnancy. Before HIPAA, the study was recruiting 12.4 women per week, as researchers looked through medical records to find out which women would be appropriate to ask to join in. After HIPAA, researchers were restricted to looking at the records of women who had signed a research registry, and recruitment fell to 2.5 women per week. When they obtained a waiver they could look at more records ? but needed to get permission from health providers before approaching potential subjects. Recruitment rose slightly to 5.7 women per week 1 . Other studies have also found a chilling effect on research 2 .  \n              Survey says \n            Ness got 13 epidemiological societies to email their active members, asking them to complete a web-based survey. Of 2,805 people accessing the website, 1,527 had submitted applications for research involving human subjects since HIPAA came into force. In the survey, published in the latest  Journal of the American Medical Association,  68% of epidemiologists agreed with the statement that research has been made more difficult by HIPAA; 2% said it had made research easier. Only 26% of 1,527 respondents agreed with the statement that the act has enhanced confidentiality 3 . The respondents represent as many as one in eight US epidemiologists, according to Ness, who conducted the research for the Societies of Epidemiology and was funded by the National Academy of Sciences' Institute of Medicine. Some researchers and bioethicists don't think that HIPAA's rule is quite so bad. George Annas, chair of the health law, bioethics and human rights department at Boston University School of Public Health in Massachusetts, says: \"Most researchers are overreacting. It probably does make their research a little more difficult, but not much.\"  \n              Red tape \n            A committee of the Institute of Medicine is currently discussing possible changes to HIPAA; Ness is acting as a consultant. Ness said it would be \"jumping the gun\" to be specific about possible modifications in advance of their decision. An editorial running alongside Ness?s work cites the HIPAA issue as yet another example of the \"increasingly dysfunctional\" regulatory system for human-subject research in the United States 4 .  \"While many critics assert that research participants are inadequately protected, there are increasing concerns that the system is over regulated, with more time and expense devoted to activities of marginal utility in protecting human research participants,\" write Norman Fost and Robert Levine, director of the program in medical ethics at the University of Wisconsin in Madison and clinical professor of laboratory medicine at Yale University School of Medicine in New Haven, Connecticut, respectively. \"In some cases these activities actually appear to be reducing protections for participants in research, by diverting energy that could be spent on more fruitful tasks.\" \n                   The road to research is paved with restrictions \n                 \n                   Genetic(al) correctness \n                 Reprints and Permissions"},

A computer at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) in California has once again been hailed as the world?s fastest computer.

The LLNL supercomputer, which uses an improved version of IBM's BlueGene/L system, now computes at 478.2 teraflops per second (1 teraflop is 1 trillion calculations), nearly three times as fast the second-place finisher, a supercomputer at the J\u00a3lich Research Centre in Germany that clocks in at 167.3 teraflops and won?t officially be open for business until early next year.

Jeff Tollefson reports. Lovers may adore platinum's silvery sheen in their favourite jewellery \u2014 but at least they can switch to gold or silver if the price isn't right. Chemical engineers wish they had the same option. Thanks to their role in catalytic converters, platinum, palladium and rhodium have all become crucial bulwarks in the fight against air pollution. Platinum and palladium can catalyse reactions that convert hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide into carbon dioxide and water vapour. Rhodium catalyses another reaction, converting nitrogen oxides into nitrogen and oxygen. These reactions are at the heart of the three-way catalytic converters now fitted on almost all cars in the developed world and on an increasing share of those in India, China and elsewhere. Although materials such as gold and nickel can perform similar tricks at lower temperatures, only these platinum-group metals can do the job at the high pressures and temperatures of 900 \u00b0C or more that are found in vehicle exhaust systems. With demand from the global automobile industry pushing prices ever higher and no alternative catalysts on the immediate horizon, car manufacturers are now locked in a race to make each ingot go a little bit further. \u201cFrom a scientific standpoint, the three-way catalytic converter is really a done deal. It's now an engineering feat to bring the volume of metals down,\u201d says Johannes Schwank, a chemical engineer at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. Chemical engineers are working on the problem at the molecular level, trying to make the catalyst layers even thinner and diluting them with cheaper alloys. Equally important is the design of the underlying structure to which the catalysts are applied \u2014 although the location of the catalytic converter and engine design can also play parts. The competition is taking place largely beyond the academic eye in industrial labs around the world. Catalytic converters were first put into use in the 1970s after the world's first regulations on car emissions came into effect in California. Automobile firms in the United States developed the technology based on advances in surface chemistry made during the previous decade. General Motors, Ford and Chrysler were all involved in the development of the catalytic converter, which Schwank regards as one of the greatest achievements in the history of chemical engineering. He compares the hydrocarbon, carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxide molecules in the converters to helicopters trying to land on the roof of a hospital; the electrochemical properties of platinum, palladium and rhodium provide an ideal landing pad. Other elements might not allow them to land at all, or might \u201chold them hostage\u201d after their arrival, he says. \u201cThe strength of the bonds is just about right to carry out the reactions, but not so strong that the reaction agents won't have a chance to leave.\u201d At first, car makers relied on platinum for this function, but eventually switched to its sister metal, palladium, at one-third of the price. When palladium prices spiked in 2000, they went back to platinum, but the cycle has now repeated itself. Platinum prices are approaching US$1,500 per troy ounce (this historic measure of precious metals is the equivalent of about 31 grams); palladium costs less than $400. The recent march of car makers back to palladium has helped to moderate the price of platinum, as has slower demand from jewellers, according to Johnson Matthey, a leading catalyst-making firm based in London. However, platinum performs better than palladium in diesel exhaust systems. Global platinum supplies stood at more than 7.6 million troy ounces in 2006, 66% of which was used in autocatalysts, according to Johnson Matthey. Those figures include the recovery of 855,000 troy ounces of platinum from recycled autocatalysts, which provided 11% of overall global demand. South Africa supplied 78% of the world's new platinum in 2006 and is home to the only mines in which platinum is a primary product. For the decade ending in 2006, platinum production increased by more than one-third \u2014 but demand for autocatalysts more than doubled. Platinum and palladium can play off each other, but manufacturers have to pay whatever the market demands for rhodium, for which there is no alternative. Posted at around $6,500 per troy ounce \u2014 almost eight times the price of gold \u2014 rhodium is one of the most expensive elements on Earth. A staggering 87% of the world supply goes into autocatalysts. Jeremy Coombes, an analyst for Johnson Matthey, says that the amounts of the metals used in each catalyst depend on the size of the car, the kind of fuel being used and the local air regulations, and can range from 1\u20132 grams for a small car in a lightly regulated environment to 12\u201315 grams for a big truck in the United States. That translates to anywhere from $25 to a few hundred dollars per vehicle, he says: a significant amount for the likes of Toyota, which sold 2.5 million vehicles last year. Autocatalysts often use honeycomb-like structures to create vast surface areas \u2014 equivalent to perhaps a couple of football pitches in each converter \u2014 in which reactions can take place. The catalysts are layered as thinly as possible, often by dipping a ceramic structure into a solution of the metal. The gradual agglomeration of metal particles under intense heat, eventually reducing the surface area and catalyst efficiency, is one of catalyst designers' main challenges. Nissan announced in August that it has deployed a new fabrication method that uses nanotechnology to reduce agglomeration. The company claimed the technique would halve the use of precious metals in its catalytic converters. Mazda said last month that it can now embed nanoparticles made of platinum-group metals into ceramic spheres, cutting use \u201cby 70\u201390% with the same level of purifying efficiency\u201d. But no public data are available to verify these claims. Although few see prospects for replacing platinum-group metals in catalytic converters, researchers are searching hard for alternatives in applications that use low-temperature catalysis. Designers of fuel cells, which catalyse hydrogen and oxygen to produce electricity and water vapour, are eagerly seeking cheaper alternatives to platinum. And Schwank says that nickel has shown promise as a catalyst for onboard fuel reforming, a technique for generating hydrogen from fossil fuels for use in fuel cells. And although advances in catalyst design are likely to further reduce the amount of platinum, palladium or rhodium needed in each vehicle, those gains might not be enough. Global automobile production has risen from 56 million vehicles in 2000 to more than 66 million last year and it shows no signs of slowing, according to the consulting firm Global Insight in Waltham, Massachusetts. \u201cThere is simply not enough platinum and rhodium going round on this planet to satisfy the collective demand of automotive emission-control systems and all of these other areas,\u201d Schwank says. Supply is sure to follow demand upwards in years to come, but few analysts expect it to get out in front, and pull prices down. That will leave new technologies that need the platinum-group metals, such as fuel cells, paying a heavy price for autocatalysts' insatiable appetite for them. \n                     Johnson Matthey's website for platinum-group metals \n                   \n                     Minerals, Critical Minerals, and the US Economy \n                   \n                     Managing Materials for a 21st Century Military \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

A prescription for wormholes that transmit light invisibly between remote regions has been devised by a team of researchers. These 'electromagnetic wormholes' are the light-based equivalent of space-time wormholes, the staples of science fiction that permit time travel and create short cuts across intergalactic space. They could one day be used in three-dimensional (3D) video-display units wired up with invisible light-carrying cables. In the electromagnetic wormholes described by Allan Greenleaf of the University of Rochester in New York state and his colleagues, light would disappear in one place and reappear in another, conveyed along channels that cannot be seen from the outside 1 . They remain theoretical at this stage, but the technologies for making them already exist. They draw on the same ideas and methods as those used recently to make invisibility shields 2 . Greenleaf's team envisages a slew of possible applications for their wormholes, in areas ranging from information technology to biomedicine (see  'What to do with a wormhole' ).They would, for example, provide perfectly insulated 'optical cables' that totally shield the world outside from the electromagnetic field of the light within. You don't see that two parts of space are connected by the wormhole until you look through it. ,  \"It's a cool idea,\" says physicist Ulf Leonhardt at the University of St Andrews in Scotland, who specializes in this kind of manipulation of light. The implication, he says, is that \"you don't see that two parts of space are connected by the wormhole until you look through it\" \u2014 rather like looking into your coffee cup and seeing the street outside. The wormholes would be made from 'metamaterials', structures engineered to interact with light in odd ways. The building blocks of metamaterials \u2014 the equivalent of atoms in normal materials \u2014 are little electrical circuits, typically made from loops and coils of wire on circuit boards. These interact with the electromagnetic field of a light beam to create unusual optical effects, such as a negative refractive index \u2014 the light is bent the 'wrong' way as it passes through. Last year, Leonhardt and a team led by David Smith of Duke University in Durham, North Carolina, independently proposed that metamaterials might be used to make an invisibility shield that bends light smoothly around an object placed inside it 3 ,   4 . Smith's group subsequently made such a shield that works at microwave frequencies 2 . The shielding in that case wasn't perfect, and worked only within a flat plane and for a very narrow frequency range. Moreover, making an invisibility shield for visible light is harder, because the components of the metamaterial have to be much smaller. Greenleaf and his colleagues say that such a shield can be regarded as 'blowing up a point': expanding an infinitely small \u2014 and thus invisible \u2014 point in space while 'moulding' the way light interacts with it so as to sustain the invisibility. Their wormholes, in contrast, are like 'blowing up a line' \u2014 in essence, rather like making a tubular shield. They have worked out a prescription for the properties a metamaterial tube would need to have in order for light from outside to bend around it while light inside bounces along the channel as if along an optical fibre. In this way, light entering one end of the wormhole would be visible at the other end \u2014 albeit with some odd distortions. If the wormhole is very short, it acts rather like a fisheye lens, they say. The researchers believe that it should be possible to make such devices with the same microwave metamaterials as those used by Smith's team. But Leonhardt cautions that this remains \"very far in the future\". Making a 3D invisibility shield is already a big challenge, he says, and a wormhole would be harder still. Smith is optimistic, however. \"A version of these wormholes at microwave frequencies could definitely be feasible, although over a very narrow frequency range,\" he says. \"I'm hoping to demonstrate lots of interesting optical structures using metamaterials in the near future, and we may add this one to the list.\"  \n               See also:  \n               \n                 Trapped rainbow \n               \n             \n                     Physical Review Letters paper \n                   \n                     David Smith's site on metamaterials and invisibility cloaks \n                   \n                     Allan Greenleaf's home page \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Researchers have for the first time created cloned primate embryos and used them to make embryonic stem-cell lines. The achievement has led to speculation about when similar success in humans might open up the door for therapeutic cloning. Embryonic stem cells can differentiate into almost any cell in the body and so have tremendous potential for therapy. If they are taken from an embryo cloned from a patient, as they were here from monkeys, they would be genetically matched and thus avoid immune rejection. The research community had once thought that cloned embryonic stem cells had been created from humans: in February 2004, Woo Suk Hwang, then at Seoul National University in South Korea, claimed to have created stem-cell lines from cloned human embryos. But Hwang?s results were later found to have been faked. The only other animal in which cloned embryonic stem cells have been created is mice. The accomplishment in primates is \"like breaking the sound barrier\", says Robert Lanza, with Advanced Cell Technology in Los Angeles, California. Although the rapid succession of clones after Dolly the Sheep was announced in 1997 gave confidence to the field of cloning, continued failure to clone human or monkey embryos led to some pessimism. Primate-cloning researcher Gerald Schatten stated in 2003, after his study of 716 monkey eggs that failed to produce a clone, that it might be impossible to do so. \"With current approaches, NT [nuclear transfer, a cloning technique] to produce embryonic stem cells in non-human primates may prove difficult ? and reproductive cloning unachievable.\" In 2004, Schatten said that he had made some ground with primate embryos, but he did not produce a stem-cell line or any successful pregnancies (see  Biologists come close to cloning primates ).  \n              From failure to success \n            A team led by Shoukhrat Mitalipov at Oregon Health and Science University in Portland, had been trying for nearly a decade to achieve reproductive cloning in primates, and had used some 15,000 eggs in the process. After Hwang's results turned out to be fraudulent, the group decided to move from reproductive cloning to try to establish a cloned embryonic stem-cell line instead ? theoretically, a more achievable goal. Last autumn, the researchers had a false start when a cloned embryo, created by inserting a monkey skin cell into a monkey egg that had had its DNA removed, produced what seemed to be viable embryonic stem cells. After a week, they watched in dismay as the cells started to differentiate uncontrollably, losing their nature as embryonic stem cells. But by January 2007, they had another line that retained its embryonic stem-cell properties, and a couple of months later, they had created yet another. These results are outlined in  Nature . David Cram, a researcher from Monash University in Victoria, Australia, and his colleagues have independently confirmed the results. Mitalipov credits their use of a machine called Oosight, which allows them to see the structures in the egg that carry DNA, thereby easing its extraction ? the first step in nuclear transfer. Conventionally, researchers have used a dye called Hoechst and ultraviolet light to locate and remove an egg's DNA. But Mitalipov's group found that both the light and the dye damaged the egg.  \n              Hundreds of eggs \n            Schatten calls the work \"a highly significant achievement\". But he warns that \"the rate of success still is very low\". Mitalipov?s team produced just 2 embryonic stem-cell lines from 304 eggs. The researchers still have little idea of what separates the successes from the failures.  Repeating the results in humans might be theoretically possible, but it would probably require a similar number of eggs. Lanza says that this is unlikely to be feasible with the current regulations in places such as California and Massachusetts, which do not allow any compensation to the prospective donors.  Lanza says that he had run \"a hundred ads in newspapers and magazines over the past year and only got one donor\" for his own research. He hopes that the success in primates might convince regulators that they should change their rules. \"Yes, we have it working in primates. Now let us go into humans,\" says Lanza.  \n              Clones a long way off \n            Mitalipov says that it is still too early to hope for success in reproductive cloning in monkeys, let alone humans; the community is generally against reproductive cloning in people. So far, the recipe Mitalipov used for his embryonic stem-cell lines has not worked for reproductive cloning. This April, the team tried to transfer 77 embryos into about a dozen surrogates. The embryos ranged in their stage of development: some were 2 days old, some were 5-day-old blastocysts. \"But no pregnancy made it even to day 25,\" says Mitalipov.  Mitalipov says that primates seem to be harder to clone reproductively than other species because the cycle of the cloned embryo has to be perfectly synchronized with the cycle of the mother that will act as surrogate. \"We have 30 to 40 animals. That's a relatively large colony, but we have to screen for weeks and the chance that they'll be in the right stages is low.\" \n                   Woo Suk Hwang special \n                 \n                   video of semos \n                 \n                   Oregon University press release \n                 Reprints and Permissions"},

Scientists and students in Pakistan have joined countrywide protests against the state of emergency, the suspension of the country's constitution and the sacking of its judiciary announced by the president, General Pervez Musharraf, on 3 November. Thousands of staff and students are continuing to demonstrate at some of the country's top universities, among them the University of the Punjab, Lahore University of Management Sciences and the GIK Institute of Engineering Sciences and Technology in Topi. There are also daily protests at the country's flagship Quaid-i-Azam University in Islamabad. On Tuesday, police tried to arrest some 500 protesting students and faculty at the university. But, according to news reports, vice-chancellor Qasim Jan stepped in and insisted that the protest continued. This is the first time the scientific community has opposed military rule in such large numbers, says Pervez Hoodbhoy, chair of physics at Quaid-i-Azam University. ?This is an unexpectedly big number, because for 20 years, since student unions were banned by General Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq [the last military ruler], Pakistani universities have been quite indifferent to national politics.? Since taking power in a coup in 1999, General Musharraf has assumed the twin roles of head of state and head of the army. But he has also carved a reputation as an economic and social liberal, and a bulwark against the al-Qaeda terrorist network. He has allowed independent media organizations to publish and broadcast. And Internet access has expanded from 40 cities in 1999 to 2,000 in 2006, with one in two Pakistanis having a mobile phone. Musharraf also presided over a massive university building programme, and introduced a tenure-track system for university professors. The numbers of PhDs emerging from universities has more than doubled to 700 annually, with plans for a further doubling in the next four years. But like all of Pakistan's previous military dictators (Musharraf is the fourth), he is having trouble letting go of the reins of power. With elections set for January, some analysts are predicting that he may agree to a power-sharing alliance with opposition leader Benazir Bhutto in which he remains head of state but gives up his role as head of the army, with Bhutto assuming the role of prime minister (for the third time). Such a scenario could have uncertain consequences for science and education. Bhutto's previous stint as prime minister (1993?96) was characterized by low investment in research and higher education. She was also much criticized by the scientific community for failing to appoint a minister for science. Leaders of Pakistan's scientific community are meeting this week at the Academy of Sciences for the Developing World in Trieste, Italy, for a seminar originally designed to showcase the country's progress in science, technology and higher education. Much of the meeting is now likely to be devoted to speculation on what will happen after the election. Among the speakers will be Atta-ur-Rahman, chair of Pakistan's Higher Education Commission and a professor of chemistry at the University of Karachi. He told  Nature  that an incoming government had a responsibility not to throw away the past: ?I hope the new government will continue on the present path.

The Mother Superior in the  Sound of Music asked: \"how do you hold a moonbeam in your hand?\" The answer to this immortal question is probably still \"you can?t\"; but physicists may have solved the equally ponderable conundrum of how to hold a rainbow. In research published in  Nature,  Ortwin Hess at the University of Surrey, Guildford, UK, and his colleagues have combined two fairly whacky physics research areas to come up with a material that, theoretically, should be able to slow light to a standstill. The material would halt each frequency of light, and hence colour, at slightly different places, to make what Hess calls a \"trapped rainbow\". The work combines knowledge about how to slow and halt light, with work on 'metamaterials' ? materials made from repeated structures of a similar size to the wavelength of incoming radiation, such as light. Metamaterials can produce some strange effects, the most exciting of which, so far, has been an invisibility cloak. Light, made of photons, is hard to tame. Photons have no charge and therefore cannot deflected by magnetic fields. So slowing them down and manipulating them like we do electrons is tricky: ?Photons are very elusive,? says Hess. So far, to get light to slow down has required the use of very cold gases, in cumbersome cryogenic experiments. And if stopped, the photons can be kept from wriggling away for only a few microseconds.  If light could ever be stopped entirely, new possibilities would open up for data storage. At the moment, processing data with optical signals is limited by how quickly the signal can be interpreted. If the signal could be slowed, more information could be processed without overloading the system.  \n              Guide that wave \n            Hess modelled how light would be affected if it travelled through a waveguide made from a material that had a core with a negative refractive index, which was sandwiched between two materials with normal, positive, refractive indices. A material with a negative refractive index bends an incoming wave in the opposite direction as would be expected in a normal material. And a waveguide, as the name suggests, is a structure that shepherds a wave in a particular direction, a simple example being an optical fibre. Hess looked at one particular 'mode' of light, and examined the 'group velocity' of the light, which is essentially the speed of the wave as it travels down the waveguide. The result of his calculations showed that the group velocity depends on the thickness of the waveguide. The reason for this correlation wasn?t obvious to Hess: \"I didn?t understand it at first,\" he says. But after a thorough crunch through the maths he quickly became convinced.  If true, the effect means that it should be possible to control the group velocity, of light simply by changing the thickness of the waveguide. At some point the thickness reaches a critical point that makes the group velocity zero, and so the wave comes to a halt.  This critical thickness differs depending on the wavelength of the light. But a wedge-shaped waveguide should stop them all. The shortest wavelength, blue, will be trapped by the thicker part of the guide, and red by the thinner part: a device that would trap a visible rainbow would be a wedge about 55 micrometres long and 0.8 to 1.4 micrometres thick.  \n              The impossible dream \n            Such a material might sound like science fiction. But other odd metamaterial inventions have been born from similar theoretical beginnings. When the possibility that a metamaterial could make something invisible was first mooted, experimentalists quickly took up the challenge, and within six months made the theory a reality.  Hess hopes that the same will happen for his trapped rainbow, although he thinks that the first practical devices are likely to be for longer wavelength waves ? infrared or microwaves ? because these require larger devices that are easier to build. As far as applications go, Hess thinks that if the speed of light can be altered at will, optical data will be much easier to handle. ?There will be applications in storing information long enough to do something with it,? he says. At the moment, says Hess, the huge broadband advantage of light is lost when it is used to transfer data simply as an on or off signal. The trapped rainbow effect opens up possibilities to transfer more data in a more complex way. \n                   Nature Photonics \n                 Reprints and Permissions"},

Bathing in the still-warm glow of receiving the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize, the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is meeting in Valencia, Spain, this week to negotiate the summation of its report on global warming. The IPCC has issued three scientific reports in the past year, and its fourth 'synthesis report' is scheduled for release on Saturday. The report aims to condense the three volumes ? nearly 2,800 pages ? into roughly 100 pages for policy-makers and government delegates who will be gathering in Bali, Indonesia, next month for the latest round of global-warming treaty talks (see  page 319 ). Scientists began arriving in Valencia last week to work out a consensus draft before the arrival of the government delegations. Stephen Schneider, a climatologist at Stanford University in California, says that the most-recent draft received 2,000 comments from governments. That compares to 5,000 comments from individual scientists on the previous draft. Given that the report will contain no new science, the challenge will be to get the scientific community and international governments to agree, paragraph by paragraph, on concise language that lays out the facts without downplaying or overstating the problem at hand. Many have criticized the process as being too political. The conservation group WWF is already warning that ?politically inspired trimming? could unnecessarily dilute the main body of science. ?Some governments will propose emphasizing the more dangerous aspects of the findings. Some will emphasize the uncertainties,? says Schneider, who is one of those working on the final draft. ?It's our job not to let either one of them go too far.? There will be much after-hours debate over what should be included in the summary, and what can be omitted. The report must also overcome legitimate divides between the three working groups, each of which approached the science from a different perspective. For instance, the first working group, which based its forecasts on climate models, was necessarily cautious about sea-level rise, saying that sea levels could rise between 18 and 59 centimetres during the twenty-first century. The second working group, however, had to look at the possibility that accelerated warming could cause sea levels to rise much faster than expected. After a year of negotiations, the two groups agreed to a statement that ?risks of metres of sea-level rise in centuries cannot be excluded,? Schneider says. ?That is weaker than working group II wants, stronger than working group I, but it's a synthesis of the reports.? The question now, he adds, is whether such language will be accepted by the government delegations. \n                     Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

A measurement has been made on a quantum system at the greatest precision theoretically possible, according to a paper published today in  Nature 1 . The team, led by Geoff Pryde of Griffith University in Brisbane, Australia, has managed to measure the interference between two light waves as they beat slightly out of step, with a precision that is limited only by Heisenberg?s uncertainty principle, the most fundamental and unavoidable source of ?fuzziness? in the quantum world. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle comes out of the mathematics describing the quantum world, in which particles exist in a 'superposition' of several states simultaneously, and have both a particle and a wave nature. It quantifies the fact that it is impossible to measure some pairs of properties of a quantum particle simultaneously as precisely as we like ? for example, position and momentum.  \n              Eliminating imprecision \n            In the real world, there are usually additional sources of imprecision in making measurements, and physicists would like to eliminate these as far as possible.  One case where that is important is in devices called interferometers, which measure changes of synchronization between two light beams. This allows ultra-accurate distance measurements, because small changes in the distances travelled by two light beams can make their wavy oscillations become out of step. Interferometry is being used, for example, to look for the tiny effects of putative gravitational waves on light from distant stars. Usually, a quantum effect called ?shot noise? adds extra imprecision to these measurements, above that due to the Heisenberg uncertainty limit.  Schemes for eliminating this imprecision have tended to depend on using quantum states that are hard to create. In an interferometer where the two beams being compared are split and sent along separate channels before being recombined, one such approach involves using ?entangled? photons and ensuring that a bunch of many photons goes down just one arm or the other, with the other arm being empty.  A large group of photons moving together like this effectively behaves like a single photon with a shorter wavelength, which helps to reduce shot noise.  \n              Single photons \n            But Pryde and his coworkers in Australia have demonstrated a way of reaching the Heisenberg limit of measurement precision without needing these elusive states: by looking at photons traversing an interferometer's arms one at a time. The key is to avoid making measurements that determine which arm the photon is in, until the beams are recombined at the end. This allows the shot noise to be more or less smoothed away.  Their system is much easier to arrange than making a bunch of many entangled photons. It produces a much weaker light signal that would be hard to measure ? but the Australian team boosts it by looping the photons through the device many times while preserving their quantum state.  \"It is really surprising that using only single photons, they can achieve the Heisenberg limit,\" says ?aslav Brukner, a quantum optics expert at the University of Vienna.  Jonathan Dowling,a physicist at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge confesses that he was very skeptical that it could be made to work when the team announced their plans at a conference at the start of the year. \"I am now forced to eat my hat,\" Dowling says.  \"This work could lead to significant improvements in high precision interferometry,\" says Brukner. It cannot yet handle the kind of light-beam intensities needed in gravity-wave detectors, but might find applications soon in high-sensitivity optical sensors and imaging technologies. \n                   Paper \n                 \n                   Pryde lab \n                 \n                   Kofler's web site \n                 Reprints and Permissions"},

Neuroscientists have fitted pigeons with recorders that pick up brain activity as the birds fly. The devices confirm that the birds really do use features from a landscape to find their way home. And researchers hope that they will be able to use the caps to unpick how birds use other types of navigational signals at different points in a journey. Scientists are pretty sure from tracking experiments that pigeons use the Sun, Earth?s magnetic field and possibly smells as guiding cues when navigating. In 2004, Hans-Peter Lipp, a behavioural neuroscientist from the University of Z\u00a3rich in Switzerland, showed that pigeons probably also use visual information. He noted that the birds tend to turn when they hit obvious landmarks like a highway exit.  These tracking experiments collected good information about the birds' location, by fitting modern global positioning system (GPS) loggers to the pigeons? backs. But no-one has been able to measure directly what information the pigeon are using to navigate ? no one has accessed the pigeons' thoughts in flight. \"If we see a bird continuing along its path after crossing a bump in the magnetic field that would normally cause it to change direction ? is this because it failed to sense the information or had a good reason to ignore it?\" asks Lipp. \"What?s going on in their minds?\"  \n              What are you thinking? \n            To find out, Lipp teamed up with Alexei Vyssotski, a biological engineer, to develop tiny electroencephalogram (EEG) recorders that can pick up electrical signals from the brain, and coupled them to GPS loggers. They fitted devices on the heads of anaesthetized pigeons that lived in a loft inland of the Italian coast, near Rome (see map). Tiny screws kept the instrument in place on the birds skulls, and served as EEG electrodes.  Then they sailed the pigeons across the Mediterranean and released them some 50 kilometres from home. When they analysed the simultaneous GPS positions and the EEG-recorded brain waves, the team found only low and high frequency waves as the birds flew over the featureless sea ? probably a sign of normal brain activity. But fluctuating levels of mid-frequency waves emerged as soon as the birds began to fly over the land. The mid-frequency waves they saw (of 12?60 Hertz) are the same as those seen in mammals when they start to pay attention to something. To be sure that these frequencies really were relevant to the navigational task, the team did another series of experiments closer to home. The researchers released the birds 5 kilometres away from their loft, requiring them to fly over a highway exit that Lipp knew, from his 2004 study, the birds used as a major landmark. The intensity of the mid-frequency band increased when the pigeons approached and crossed this highway exit.  \n              Invisible lines \n            The group presented their work yesterday at the Society for Neuroscience meeting in San Diego, California.  The methodology, says Lipp, is proof of principle that the little device can monitor brain activity related to navigation. \"What we really want to use it for is to search for changes in brain activity when the pigeons cross sites that contain navigational information invisible to humans, such as electromagnetic sources, for example,\" he says. The team would also expect to see a flurry of activity in mid-frequency waves at that point. The team just hopes that their instrument-laden birds, which look a little like science fiction, don't land in St Peter's Square in Vatican City and frighten anyone. So far they have only flown over this famous landmark. \"At least they didn?t land among the tourists,?

When the spring rains soak the western United States, two types of spadefoot toads surface from their underground burrows and converge on ponds and puddles to find a suitable mate. Male toads fill the night air with a lusty cacophony of croaks and females use the songs to zero in on a good partner. With only one mating season a year, the girls need to be picky. But surprisingly, researchers have found that under some conditions the females will chose a partner of another species from the puddle of possible mates. Karen Pfennig, a biologist at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, has discovered that they take this extreme mating measure to ensure that their offspring have the best chance of survival ? even if it means that those offspring will themselves have a lower chance of reproducing successfully. The two spadefoot toad species involved,  Spea bombifrons  and  S. multiplicata,  look much the same to the untrained eye. But  S. bombifrons  has more of a pug nose and a bump between its eyes, whereas  S. multiplicata  lacks the bump and has a nose \"more like Kermit the frog\" says Pfennig.  Generally, when cross-species mating occurs, fertile offspring are not produced. When these two toads get together, they yield males that are sometimes sterile, and female offspring that produce about half the number of eggs as a purebred. That's enough for scientists to label them as different species, and for the two to usually avoid interbreeding. However, Pfennig had previously noticed that there are some circumstances in which  S. bombifrons  females will take a chance and seek out a male partner from the other species.  \n              Fancy that \n            To investigate this further, Pfennig played recordings of songs from the males of each species: the baritone croak of  S. multiplicata  ( video ) from one speaker and the tenor quack of  S. bombifrons  from another ( video ). She then recorded which speaker the female  S. bombifrons  approached.  Female  S. bombifrons  were more likely to approach the call of an  S. multiplicata  male when in shallow waters, she found.  This suggests that  S. bombifrons  might benefit in some way from cross-species hybridization when waters are shallow. One possibility is that the toads need their offspring to develop more quickly when water is in short supply, so that the tadpoles turn to toads before the shallow puddles run dry.  S. bombifrons  are slower to develop;  S. multiplicata  and hybrids are both faster. Field tests confirmed that hybrid tadpoles were more likely to survive through metamorphosis in rapidly drying pools. The results are published this week in  Science .  \n              Driven to another species \n            Other animals have been shown to vary their mate preferences according to their surroundings, but this is the first time that harsh environmental conditions have been shown to drive an animal across the species barrier. ?It?s quite spectacular,? comments Maurice Sabelis of the University of Amsterdam in the Netherlands. ?You have an example of one species relying on another to produce viable offspring.?  This type of dependence on another species could have implications for researchers trying to preserve toads, notes Sabelis. Researchers should take heed that things may be more complicated than they have assumed, he says. ?It?s a warning. Such complexities might play a crucial role for species conservation.? Pfennig says that the results emphasize that mate selection isn?t just a matter of sizing up male ornamentation. ?Females are probably assessing a lot more out there than just how long the male?s tail is,? she says. ?They are probably more sensitive to their own condition and environment when choosing a male.? \n                   Karin Pfennig \n                 \n                   Maurice Sabelis \n                 \n                   Science magazine \n                 Reprints and Permissions"},

But does that mean the pill is dangerous? Heidi Ledford takes a look at why it?s so hard to get a straight answer. \n              So what are they saying about the pill? \n            Researchers have found that plaque accumulation in the arteries is greater in women who use birth-control pills than in those who never have. Plaque is the hardened fat and cholesterol that can clog arteries and lead to heart disease and stroke. Researchers at Ghent University in Belgium studied more than 1,000 women who had taken oral contraceptives for a period of time and then stopped. They found a 20-30% increase in the amount of plaque for every decade the woman was on the pill. The results were presented this week at the American Heart Association meeting in Orlando, Florida, but have not yet been published.  Meanwhile, another study published this week in  The Lancet  confirms previous findings that the risk of cervical cancer is higher in women who are on the pill 1 . That risk drops back down to normal levels within ten years of quitting the pill, they found.  \n              Does this mean women on the pill should panic? \n            No. The overall risk of cervical cancer associated with birth control is nothing new. And although the findings on artery-clogging plaque are novel, they are also preliminary, cautions Sharonne Hayes, director of the Women?s Heart Clinic at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota.  ?We know that when you are taking oral contraceptives there is an increased cardiovascular risk,? says Hayes. But several previous studies have shown that the risk declines after women stop taking the pill, she adds. Furthermore, the women in the plaque study had taken an older generation of birth control pills that contained higher doses of hormones.  ?It?s an interesting finding and we should look more at this,? says Hayes. ?But we shouldn?t read too much into it.?  \n              If the cervical cancer findings aren't new, what else do we know about the birth-control pill and health risks? \n            Studies have shown that the pill can increase the risk of stroke, cervical cancer, cardiovascular disease and breast cancer. But other studies have also shown that it protects against ovarian cancer, endometrial cancer, acne ... and breast cancer.  \n              Wait, why is breast cancer on both of those lists? \n            The jury is still out on breast cancer. This disease is known to be linked to hormone levels, so it makes sense to look for a link to the pill. An analysis of more than 150,000 women worldwide found a slightly increased incidence of breast cancer in women on the pill 2 . But other studies have found no effect of oral contraceptives on breast-cancer risk. And a study published last month found that use of the pill did not affect the likelihood of death from breast cancer in more than 4,000 women diagnosed with the disease 3 .  Different birth-control pills contain different amounts of different hormones; some pill formulations may actually reduce the risk of breast cancer, says Hayes.  \n              How do other risks and benefits stack up against each other? \n           A recent study of around 46,000 women found a slight reduction in total cancer risk in women who used birth control (the reduced risk of ovarian and endometrial cancer is generally thought to outweigh the increased risk of cervical cancer and breast cancer) 4 . But most of the women in that study were white and from the United Kingdom; the results may not hold true in other populations in other parts of the world. Some risk factors, such as how many children a woman has and how old she is when she has them, vary between women and between cultures.  \"If using the pill allowed you to have fewer children and have the first child later in life, that alone would reduce the risk of cervical cancer,\" says Jane Green, a cancer epidemiologist at the University of Oxford, UK, and an author on the recent cervical-cancer study. The risk of stroke during a full pregnancy and the post-partum period is twice as high as the risk from birth control, Green adds.  \n              Can someone please just tell me if the pill is good or bad? \n            ?It?s very, very hard to give an overall 'the pill is good, the pill is bad' assessment,? says Green.  \n              Why is it so hard to get a straight answer? \n            In addition to differences between populations of women, study results can be muddied by differences in the composition and concentration of hormones in the many different birth-control pills on the market, says Hayes. ?You can?t lump all oral contraceptives together.?  Many studies were begun years or decades ago, when birth-control pills contained higher overall levels of hormones and the hormones were derived from different sources. ?The drugs we?re using now are very different,? says Hayes.  ?This is one of the problems we often face in medicine. We start a study only to have the treatment evolve radically between the beginning of the study and its end. You can get good results, but they?re not necessarily clinically relevant.? And, Hayes notes, study designs are often less than ideal. ?It would be very hard to randomize an oral-contraceptive trial,? she says. \n                   Nature Outlook: Fertility \n                 \n                   Dissect Medicine \n                 \n                   Spoonful of Medicine blog \n                 \n                   National Cancer Institute: Oral Contraceptives and Cancer Q&A \n                 \n                   Medline Oral Contraceptives Page \n                 \n                   American Heart Association Orlando Meeting \n                 Reprints and Permissions"},

It has been called one of the greatest discoveries in modern cosmology, and most astronomers believe that it makes up more than two-thirds of the stuff in the Universe. Now one theorist is suggesting that dark energy might be little more than a mirage. Subir Sarkar, a theoretical physicist at Oxford University, UK, has written a treatise that suggests that dark energy, a mysterious force that seems to be pushing the Universe apart, might actually be the result of an enormous bubble of empty space around our galaxy. The paper is available on the physics preprint server ArXiv 1 . Sarkar says he has floated the idea to encourage astronomers to make more careful measurements of the rate of expansion of our Universe using tools already available, before being so certain of the existence of dark energy. \"I'm simply concerned that people are not doing mundane checks they ought to be doing before making these claims,\" he says. \"People seem to be more concerned about planning mega-projects for the future,\" he says.  \n              Dark force \n            Dark energy was first measured in 1998, when two teams of astronomers discovered that certain kinds of supernovae appeared dimmer than they should. If these supernovae were as far away as they should be based on calculations of the acceleration of the Universe, then they ought to have looked brighter. Instead they seemed to be farther away than theory would allow. The findings could be explained if dark energy was pushing the Universe apart.  In combination with evidence from the cosmic microwave background ? the faint afterglow of the Big Bang ? theorists have estimated that this energy must make up roughly 70% of the stuff in the Universe. But Sarkar says that the astronomical community has been too quick to accept dark energy, which has continued to defy astronomer's attempts to characterize it (see  A constant problem ). As an alternative hypothesis, he suggests that our Galaxy might lie in a huge bubble of comparatively empty space. The denser area of space outside this bubble would then pull material towards it. To an observer inside the bubble, it would seem as though a dark-energy-like force was pulling the Universe apart.  \n              Hubble bubble \n            Small bubbles of low density are known to exist in the Universe, and researchers have previously considered that a local 'Hubble bubble' around the Milky Way might explain the supernovae results, says Adam Riess, an astronomer at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland. But measurements have shown that a small, local bubble would not have much of an effect on dark energy's strength, he says. \"We put in the void, took the void out, and it doesn't change the answer,\" he says. Sarkar is proposing a much, much bigger void ? about 800 million light years in radius. A void of that size would be extremely unusual. But Sarkar notes that astronomers earlier this year found what could be a 450-million-light-year radius bubble about 6 billion light years away 2 . That's still smaller than what Sarkar proposes, but it's the right order of magnitude. \"Maybe the Universe is not really as smooth as people believe,\" he says.  \n              Double check \n            Sarkar says that his theory could be easily checked by making more extensive measurements of the Hubble constant, which describes the rate of expansion of the Universe. If we are in a low-density bubble, this 'constant' should be unusually large in our vacinity, and have a smaller value farther away from us. Current measurements of the Hubble constant are variable from one place in the sky to another. But researchers cannot tell if this variation is due to error in the measurements, or is something real. Riess takes issue with a number of Sarkar's interpretations of data, and says such a huge bubble is very unlikely. Both agree that better measurements are called for. \"We should do the easiest things first that inform the cosmology the most,\" Riess agrees. He says his team is now making measurements to help reduce the Hubble constant's uncertainty. \n                   Sarkar's Paper \n                 \n                   Reiss's homepage \n                 \n                   More on the Hubble constant \n                 Reprints and Permissions"},

Antioxidants are all the rage, with research suggesting that they may help to prevent cancer, strokes and heart disease. Now a study highlights how these oxygen-mopping compounds affect more than just cellular health: they also seem to effect behaviour. Male three-spined stickleback fish ( Gasterosteus aculeatus)  fed on a high-antioxidant diet spend more time and energy fanning oxygen-rich water onto the eggs in their nest, researchers have found. The results aren?t entirely surprising, as an indirect link between diet, well-being and behaviour makes sense. ?I would expect to see some behavioural changes from antioxidants through effects on body condition or immunocompetence,? says Ulrika Candolin, an ecologist at the University of Helsinki in Finland. ?But this study suggests a direct pathway, which is interesting.? A lack of antioxidants seems to make the fish?s muscles tire more readily.  Candolin says she thinks it is likely that behavioural changes would be seen in other animals deprived of antioxidants. But whether these changes are the result of fatigue or deteriorating health would require further study.  \n              Red bellies \n            Stickleback fish feed on fungi and algae that produce organic pigments called carotenoids. These pigments come in reds, oranges and yellows and serve many purposes, but key among them is their importance in sexual display. They give zebra finches their orange beaks, blue tits their yellow feathers and sticklebacks their red bellies. All these characteristics are used to attract mates. Without carotenoids, the animals lose their colour and so will fail to impress potential partners. When it was discovered that carotenoids also function as antioxidants, Tom Pike at the University of Glasgow, UK, and a team of researchers became interested in how fish would respond to a diet low in the colourful compounds. Pike and his colleagues placed 40 male sticklebacks in individual aquaria and fed them fish food containing either 10 or 200 micrograms of carotenoids per gram of fish food ? within the normal range that they would get in the wild ? over six months. The researchers then placed gravid females in with the males, allowed them to spawn, and then removed them again. The males initiated their standard behaviour of fanning their eggs with their pectoral fins, an activity that oxygenates the eggs and improves offspring survival, particularly in hypoxic waters.  \n              The spring in your step \n            They then watched how fish on different diets responded when oxygen levels in the water were reduced to 30% of normal. They report in  Behavioural Ecology 1  that sticklebacks on high-antioxidant diets increased their fanning from 49% of the time to 82% of the time, whereas sticklebacks fed low-antioxidant diets did not increase their fanning activities. ?What really surprised us was that there was a behavioural response to a lack of carotenoids,? says Pike. ?The fish were otherwise completely healthy, so we think the absence of carotenoid antioxidants caused muscle fatigue in the fish from strenuous exercise.? As for humans, despite the large volumes of work being done on the effects of antioxidants on our bodies, Pike points out that there has been very little research on antioxidants and behaviour. But he guesses it might have a similar effect: ?While I don?t think consuming lots of antioxidants is necessarily going to add a spring to your step, not getting enough could take your spring away,? he says. \n                   National Cancer Institute: Antioxidants \n                 \n                   National Instututes of Health, Medline Plus: Antioxidants  \n                 Reprints and Permissions"},

Does breast-feeding a child boost its brain development and raise its intelligence? Only if the child carries a version of a gene that can harness the goodness of breast-milk, say researchers. The results add to the ?nature versus nurture? debate over intelligence, by showing how the two effects can interact. The question of whether people are born intelligent or made intelligent by their environment has been debated for decades. Research with identical twins separated at birth has shown that both genetics and rearing conditions are important in determining intelligence. One of the important environmental effects seems to be breast-feeding. Children who are breast-fed generally perform better in IQ tests than do those fed on other types of milk. Researchers think that this might be because specific fatty acids found in human milk, but not in cow?s milk or infant formulas, improve brain development. Avshalom Caspi and Terrie Moffitt, psychologists at King?s College, London, and their colleagues looked at the relationship between breast-feeding and intelligence to explore the possibility that in this case nature and nurture might be intimately linked. The group first looked for genes that metabolize fatty acids, which in turn are important for the growth of neurons. Differences in such genes, they hypothesized, might moderate the intellectual advantage associated with breast-feeding. They searched the literature and gene databases and found a good candidate: a gene called  FADS2 .  \n              Class test \n            The team then looked at more than 1,000 children in New Zealand who were born in 1972 and IQ tested at ages 7, 9, 11, and 13; a record was kept of which children had been breast-fed. The study was repeated with about 2,200 children in Britain who were born in 1994?95 and IQ tested at age 5. DNA tests were used to look at a specific spot in their  FADS2  genes, to see which version or ?allele? of the gene they carried.  In children who carried at least one copy of a ?C? allele for  FASD2 , those who were breast-fed generally had a higher IQ than those who were not: by an average of 6.4 IQ points in the New Zealand study, and by 7.0 IQ points in the British one. By contrast, children carrying two ?G? alleles had roughly the same IQ irrespective of their diet. About 10% of the population is thought to be ?GG?. ?We had a very strong hypothesis, but it could easily have turned out wrong, so we were pleased when the data fit the hypothesis in New Zealand, and then really delighted when it was confirmed in Britain,? says Moffitt. The team reports their findings in the  Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 1 . Why and how this genetic difference came into being is unclear. ?It is almost as though the G allele evolved as a protective genotype for children who might not get enough breast-milk,? says developmental psychologist Linda Gottfredson at the University of Delaware in Newark.  \n              Mother care \n            The result will help to settle the debate over whether breast-feeding is linked to intelligence because of the nutritional quality of the milk, or because mothers who breast-feed are the sorts of mothers who encourage child learning. ?I think this research will settle that debate, or at the very least bring it near a close,? says epidemiologist Jean Golding at the University of Bristol, UK.  It might also serve as a guide for researchers aiming to find the genetic factors that affect other complex developmental factors, such as height. Such studies are usually approached by scanning thousands of people in search for different alleles associated with the trait of interest. ?This research is suggesting that simply looking at huge samples may be missing the point,? says psychologist and geneticist Matt McGue of the University of Minnesota in Twin Cities. He notes that using specific context clues, as was done in this study, is a more efficient way to look for a gene.  And the finding contributes to the growing feeling that scientists shouldn?t think of nature or nurture acting in isolation from each other. ?Our team has reported gene?environment interactions involved in depression, violence and psychosis ... with these new data, many of us are starting to think that ?nature via nurture? might be a better catch phrase,? says Caspi. \n                   CDC information on breastfeeding \n                 Reprints and Permissions"},

From its roof garden to its forests, fish, penguins and bats, the new headquarters of the California Academy of Sciences will be teeming with life when it opens to the public late next year. But the museum won?t just preach about saving Earth?s gems. It will live by its own philosophy, thanks to 'green architecture' that makes the building itself healthier than its predecessor for people and the planet. Today, the academy receives the keys to its new building, which will replace its old headquarters in San Francisco?s Golden Gate Park. The headquarters have housed the academy?s collections since 1916, but when the building was damaged during the 1989 Loma Prieta Earthquake, the academy decided to commission renowned architect Renzo Piano to design the $484-million new headquarters on the site of its old home.  \n              Green jeans and more \n            The steel and rubble from the old headquarters were recycled into other buildings and new roads. And the new headquarters has so many Earth-friendly design features that it beats the energy-use standards set by the US Department of Energy by 30%.  It is also expected to be the first museum to earn the highest stamp of approval from the US Green Building Council?s Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Green Building Rating System ? a nationally accepted set of benchmarks for green design.  The new building?s insulation is made from recycled blue jeans rather than new materials. Its 'living roof' of native plants and wildflowers, which don't require much water, will help to cool the building. And the people who work inside can open and close the windows manually, cutting the need for building-wide air-conditioning and heating systems that are so essential in parts of the world without such a consistent year-round temperature. The exhibits themselves will also have Earth-friendly features. A salt-water coral-reef tank, for instance, will be exposed to the Sun along one side, lessening the amount of artificial heat needed to warm it to tropical temperatures. And the academy has preserved and re-used some of the old walls of one exhibit, the African Hall, which was one of the old building?s most popular attractions.  All these features mean that the new building will look nothing like the fusty, dusty natural history museums of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, says Greg Farrington, executive director of the academy.  \"The topic of our museum is all life and sustainability ? it's about how we got here and how we can find a way to stay,\" Farrington says. \"So we knew we needed to think about the museum as a teaching exhibit to address sustainability and what it's going to take to live on Earth this way.\" \n                   Science in culture: London's gherkin \n                 \n                   Nature Network Boston: Cambridge goes green \n                 \n                   LEED Web site \n                 \n                   California Academy of Sciences \n                 Reprints and Permissions"},

Researchers have found a drug that can reduce aggressive behaviour in feral rats that have been trained to be violent. Although the find may not lead directly to a cure for pathological violence in humans, it does unpick a mechanism behind such violence, the researchers say, which could open the door to future treatments. Sietse de Boer and his colleagues from the University of Groningen in the Netherlands, who have developed the first animal model of pathological aggression, reported these findings at the Society for Neuroscience meeting in San Diego yesterday.  Although violence is a serious societal problem, until now scientists have only been able to study 'normal' or 'appropriate' aggression in animals ? such as fighting over limited resources of food or mates. Such studies are usually done using normal laboratory rodents, which have been bred over the decades to be docile and easier for researchers to handle.  So the researchers decided to work with feral rats instead. Although a male rat will fight other males, it won?t attack females, preferring instead to court their sexual favours. It will also not fight with an anaesthetised 'intruder', recognising that it poses no threat. But de Boer was able to change this, training the rats to be gratuitously violent.  \n              Angry rats \n            The team engendered violent characteristics by introducing feeble intruder rats that were bound to lose battles, each day for two or three weeks. After repeated victories over other rats, the test animals began to behave in a more pathologically violent manner, fighting all-comers more brutally ? including weak females and senseless males which presented no threat to them.  Then de Boer looked at levels of the neurotransmitter serotonin in the rats? brains. Low levels of serotonin are linked very strongly to aggressive behaviour, and pathologically violent people have been found to have lower levels of serotonin metabolites in their spinal fluid. Additionally, some antidepressants that increase serotonin levels have been seen to reduce violent behaviour in some people. Although brain levels of serotonin don?t change in rats as a result of normal, 'appropriate' acts of aggression, de Boer found that these levels did sink in his pathologically aggressive rats.  \n              Aggressive streak \n            The researchers also found that they could alter the aggressive behaviour of their rats by manipulating the serotonin system. They gave the rats S-15535, a compound that binds exclusively to a neuron 'autoreceptor' that acts to dampen the serotonin system. This autoreceptor is called 5-HT1a. Binding to it seems to bring serotonin levels in the rats back to normal. When even very low doses of S-15535 were used to bind to the receptors, de Boer found that both the serotonin and the violence of the pathologically aggressive rats returned to normal levels. The much more limited violence of naturally low-aggression rats could also be brought back to normal by the compound ? but only by using higher doses. The compound seems to work by ?fixing? the serotonin breaking system, which becomes dysfunctional in the super-aggressive rats, says de Boer.  Unlike a tranquilizer, S-15535 didn?t make the rats lethargic or ?spaced out?, it reduced their aggressiveness without affecting other behaviour.  \n              No magic bullet \n            It is unknown whether S-15535 is a good drug candidate for pathologically violent people. \"I can?t imagine that we can pin such a complex behaviour as pathological violence in humans on one single receptor,\" says de Boer.  But the study does prove that the serotonin system plays an important role in abnormally violent behaviour. And understanding the system is the first step to being able to control it, he points out. Researchers at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory at Monterotondo in Italy have independently confirmed the importance of the 5-HT1a autoreceptor in aggression. At the same meeting, Enrica Audero and her colleagues reported results from experiments using their genetically modified mice, which can be made to overexpress the gene for this autoreceptor at any time. The group found that when they switched on this overexpression, the mice became more aggressive. When they switched it off again, the mice went back to normal behaviour. \"The two studies are pointing in the same direction,\" says Audero. \n                   Society for Neuroscience blog  \n                 \n                   Society for Neuroscience meeting  \n                 \n                   Previous work by De Boer  \n                 Reprints and Permissions"},

It?s a common situation: you?re embroiled in an argument over a fact and you know for certain that you have the right answer. But when someone rushes to their laptop to google the correct answer, you discover that you were wrong.  Whether in a fight with a spouse or giving testimony on the witness stand, it is clear that our memories are not always trustworthy. Now, researchers have found that although those vivid false memories may seem indistinguishable from true memories to you, but they are sometimes processed by different parts of the brain 1 . The results could one day be used to devise an early test for Alzheimer?s disease, or to assess the accuracy of witness testimony, says study author Roberto Cabeza, a neuroscientist at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina. Cabeza and Hongkeun Kim of Daegu University in South Korea asked 11 people to read lists of words that fall into a certain category, such as ?farm animals?. The subjects were later asked whether specific words had occurred on the original lists, while functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to measure the changes in blood flow to different areas of their brains. The participants were also asked to say how confident they were in their answers. The researchers found that when study participants had confidence in their answer and they were correct, blood flow increased to the medial temporal lobes located near the dividing line between halves of the brain. This region of the brain contains the hippocampus, and is important for memory.  But when subjects had confidence in their answer but were wrong (which happened up to 20% of the time depending on the circumstances), the frontoparietal region lit up. Those regions are associated with what Cabeza calls a sense of ?familiarity?.  \n              Don?t I know you? \n            Familiarity is a general feeling that an event has happened in the past, even though you can?t recall the specific details, such as when you are sure you have seen someone before, but can?t remember her name or how you know her. ?It?s basically an empty feeling,? says Cabeza. ?In the case of true memories, you have real details to retrieve.?  Previous work with brain injury patients has shown that familiarity and recollection are separate things, which can be affected independently. True recollection declines as we age, while the capacity for remembering familiarity remains intact.  But this pattern does not hold true in Alzheimer?s patients, notes Cabeza. ?In Alzheimer?s patients, we see a deficit in both kinds of memory,? says Cabeza. So he suggests that measures of brain activity connected to familiarity could be used as an early diagnosis for the disease.  \n              Accuracy and confidence \n            Such brain scans may one day help to distinguish real memories from false ones on the witness stand, Cabeza says. Brain scans like these have previously been suggested for use in distinguishing people who know they are lying from those who know they are telling the truth. It could also help to distinguish accidental lies from the truth, this study suggests.  But the scans aren?t as clear cut as one might hope them to be. Another kind of memory, called ?phantom recollection?, occurs when your brain provides you with false details appropriated from other memories: for example, if you saw a woman and not only felt certain that you had met her before, but also mistakenly ?knew? that her name is Sheila and she went to college with you. Phantom recollections occur less frequently than false memories, but they can activate the medial temporal lobe just as true memories do, says Cabeza. For Valerie Reyna, a cognitive neuroscientist at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, the results underscore the fact that judges and juries should not use a witness?s confidence in their own answers as a signal that the answers are more likely to be true. ?It is really surprising, but there is a very weak relation between accuracy and confidence,? she says. \n                   Plasticity and neuronal computation Insight \n                 \n                   Nature Aging supplement \n                 \n                   Nature Neuroscience blog \n                 \n                   Cabeza Lab \n                 \n                   Valerie Reyna \n                 \n                   Journal of Neuroscience \n                 Reprints and Permissions"},

The body's circadian rhythm ? the internal 'clock' that regulates physiological processes ? can be shifted by eating more fat, say researchers 1 . This surprising finding suggests that a more complex interplay exists between the body clock and metabolism, with implications for disorders such as diabetes and obesity.  The circadian rhythm is a near-24-hour cycle that is known to be modulated by sunlight and eating schedules. Previous studies have shown that a disrupted circadian rhythm leads people to crave high-fat foods. And a study out this week shows that children who lack sleep risk being overweight 2 . This is an issue of increasing concern as researchers attempt to elucidate the link between disturbances in circadian rhythm and health conditions such as obesity, heart disease and diabetes 3 .  Joseph Bass, an endocrinologist at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois, fed a group of male mice a diet in which 45% of the calories were derived from fat, and monitored their daily wheel-running schedule. Mice given high-fat food had 23.8-hour daily cycles, whereas the body clock in control mice, whose caloric intake included only 16% fat, was 23.6 hours long1. The internal time change occurred before the mice had gained any weight, although the researchers did not measure changes in body-fat percentage.  \"This is the first time that a paper has really shown the impact of feeding on the molecular and behavioural expression of the circadian rhythm,\" says Eve Van Cauter, a sleep researcher at the University of Chicago in Illinois, who was not affiliated with the study. \"In a human, this would mean the person would have increased difficulties going to bed at a reasonable time,\" she says. \"That might result in insomnia or night-eating\", which further boost the risk of obesity and diabetes.  The link between circadian rhythm and metabolism is not surprising, says Bass, because the two systems share many molecular signalling pathways. The expression patterns of some genes involved in lipid metabolism change in 24-hour cycles, and several nuclear receptors that are activated by sterols regulate expression of clock-related genes 4 . In addition, mice bearing mutations in the circadian-rhythm gene Clock show signs of metabolic dysregulation, including obesity and altered expression of genes involved in appetite regulation 5 .   Precisely how a fatty diet could disturb the circadian clock remains elusive, but the hunt is on. \"In discovering these molecular switches that couple metabolic and circadian systems, we might actually uncover new pathways or targets to alter metabolic state,\" says Bass. Research has shown that the activity of two clock-regulating proteins depends on the nutrient status of the cell 6 , providing one possible molecular connection, he says.  Others note that the connection between nutrient status and clock length may be indirect. The eating habits of mice on the high-fat diet also altered ? they ate more and consumed more calories during the day, when mice normally sleep. It could be that the change in eating habits, rather than a direct effect of specific nutrients, altered their body clocks, says Hitoshi Ando at Kanazawa University in Japan. Ando has studied the impact of fatty food on the body clock in female mice, but found only a minimal effect 7 . The reason for that discrepancy is unclear, he says. \n                   Nature Insight: Obesity and Diabetes  \n                 \n                   Nature Insight: Sleep \n                 \n                   Dissect Medicine \n                 \n                   Spoonful of Medicine blog \n                 \n                   Joseph Bass \n                 Reprints and Permissions"},

Eight years ago Gordon Brown, then Britain's chancellor of the exchequer, announced a wide-ranging 'climate levy' on industrial carbon emissions. He pledged that the levy would benefit the environment and encourage investment in cleaner technologies. But a recent audit ? one of the most far-reaching of its type in the world ? suggests that the scheme's bark was worse than its bite. The widely respected National Audit Office (NAO) reported in August that nearly 90% of its estimated impact occurred even before the levy started in 2001, as firms reacted to the idea. Subsequent reductions that could be attributed to the actual tax itself were small. ?It appears that the announcement had more of an impact than the taxes,? says Tim Yeo, a Conservative MP and chair of the House of Commons Environmental Audit Committee, which has an investigation of its own under way. The NAO estimated that the levy cut Britain's total annual industrial emissions of about 60 million tonnes of carbon by 3.1 million tonnes between 1999 and 2001, but by only 400,000 tonnes in subsequent years. ?I don't think the levy is doing very much,? says Terry Barker, an economist at the University of Cambridge and chairman of the consultancy firm Cambridge Econometrics, which has carried out several analyses of the tax's impact for the Department of Food, Agriculture and Rural Affairs (DEFRA), which is responsible for its implementation.  \n                Soft targets \n              As originally conceived, the climate levy would simply have taxed industrial users on their overall energy consumption. But the UK treasury, sensitive to charges from the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) and other lobby groups that such a tax would damage the competitiveness of UK firms, agreed to a more complex implementation that seems to have reduced its effectiveness. Energy-intensive sectors such as brewing and bulk chemicals can win an 80% rebate on the tax if the sector as a whole is managing to meet emissions targets that they negotiate with DEFRA. For example, a 2001 agreement guaranteed brewers the rebate if they managed to cut energy use on every pint of beer produced by 9% over seven years ? which they then did. According to Barker, DEFRA officials negotiating these targets lacked detailed knowledge of the sectors in question and were usually out-foxed by industry, agreeing to targets that the sectors could meet without much effort. Matthew Farrow, head of environmental policy at the CBI, disagrees with this assessment, saying that both sides lacked information on how easily emissions cuts could be achieved. ?When the agreements were first negotiated in many sectors, there wasn't much data,? he says. The NAO reports that the resulting agreements were usually modest in scope. They typically required sectors to cut their emissions per unit of production ? not of total emissions. This meant that industries could increase overall emissions if production increased, and not lose their rebate. And when sector targets were renegotiated in 2004, ten sectors out of 45 renegotiated agreements with DEFRA that exempted them from 80% of the levy as long as they met a 2010 target that turned out to be actually above their reported 2004 emissions, when those figures became available. As a result, the agreements part of the levy has fallen short of its goals, according to the NAO. It was supposed to deliver a 2.9-million-tonne annual reduction in carbon emissions by 2010, but a revised estimate now puts this figure at 1.9 million tonnes. By contrast, it is estimated that rising energy prices and other factors will deliver a total of 2.4 million tonnes of annual reductions by 2010. According to the NAO, the impact of the levy on sectors excluded from agreements, such as retail and banking, is hard to gauge as they are not required to report their emissions. Environmentalists say that even the full levy of 0.44 pence on a kilowatt-hour of electricity ? less than 10% of the cost of the energy ? is too small to make a difference. ?The fact is that it didn't significantly hit the bottom line,? says Mike Childs, head of campaigns at environmental group Friends of the Earth in London. Nevertheless, many believe the levy has had a positive impact. It forced many sectors to look at their consumption, says Paul Ekins, head of the environmental group at the Policy Studies Institute, a London-based think-tank. ?Boards will have demanded reports on energy use, probably for the first time in their lives,? he says. And despite being critical of the tax, Childs and others still see the levy as a useful starting point for Britain ? and an example for other countries. The UK government has announced that it will extend both the levy and the sector agreements until 2017. But Yeo says that his committee, when it reports next month, may advocate the renegotiation of these agreements to give the climate levy some much-needed teeth. \n                     National Audit Office Report \n                   \n                     DEFRA's page on the agreements \n                   \n                     The Environmental Audit Committee \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Quantum mechanics might be capable of stripping bare a black hole to reveal the mysterious and unseeable 'singularity' that exists at its heart, say George Matsas and Andr\u00e3 da Silva of the S\u00e3o Paulo State University in Brazil. It has long been suspected that these singularities ? where the known laws of physics break down ? are always decorously veiled behind the 'event horizon', a boundary beyond which light cannot escape from the fearsome gravitational pull of a black hole. Theoretically, nothing within an event horizon can ever be perceived or investigated by an outside observer, because no light can escape. So the singularities remain insulated from the rest of the Universe. This amounts to what in 1969 physicist Roger Penrose called 'cosmic censorship', whereby the laws of physics conspire to save us from having to gaze on the unthinkable. According to Einstein's general theory of relativity, in the middle of a black hole, its mass collapses in on itself to form an infinitely small, infinitely dense point, where space-time itself is punctured. Even causality ? the relation of a cause and its effect ? breaks down, which seems to defy not only physics but logic. ?Penrose's motivation seemed to be to preserve the decorum of physics,? Matsas says. But physicists have wondered whether event horizons are ever stripped away, leaving these absurdist singularities naked. One possibility, for example, is that the event horizon might vanish if a black hole spins very fast. Light and matter might then be flung out by centrifugal force. In September, physicists Arlie Petters of Duke University in Durham, North Carolina, and Marcus Werner of the University of Cambridge, UK, proposed that singularities stripped naked by fast rotation should be detectable by astronomers because they act as very strong 'gravitational lenses', bending the light coming from stars behind them by their distortion of space-time. Petters and Werner say that existing telescopes should have sufficient spatial resolution to spot naked singularities in the centre of our own Galaxy. But how could a black hole spin fast enough to bare its heart? It was shown in the 1970s that a black hole's spin cannot be increased by swallowing rotating objects, because the gain in angular momentum ? the momentum caused by rotation ? is generally balanced by the slowing influence of the extra mass. To transfer enough angular momentum to the hole to overspin it into nakedness, a particle would have to approach the event horizon at such a high speed and such a glancing angle (similar to stroking the side of a spinning-top) that it wouldn't get sucked inside the event horizon in the first place. No way of creating a naked singularity has yet been discovered within the framework of the classical physics described by the theory of relativity. But in a paper published last week, Matsas and da Silva propose that quantum mechanics, which normally applies only to very small objects, could subvert cosmic censorship. An electrically charged black hole spinning fast enough to be right on the brink of losing its event horizon might be pushed over the edge by gaining angular momentum in a non-classical way, they conclude. Quantum particles have the strange property of being able to 'tunnel' through barriers that, according to classical mechanics, they have insufficient energy to pass over or through. So whereas classical particles with enough angular momentum to overspin a black hole can't get inside the event horizon for the reasons explained in the 1970s, Matsas and da Silva's study finds that quantum particles could tunnel inside, and send the black hole over the brink into nakedness. ?It's a neat idea,? says Petters. ?One issue is whether such black holes exist, or if they will remain charged long enough for us to catch one, since charged black holes tend to become neutralized.? Matsas himself cautions that the work does not necessarily mean that cosmic censorship is violated in reality, because quantum theory is known to be incomplete. The general theory of relativity that explains gravity and predicts black holes, and the theory of quantum mechanics, are known to be fundamentally incompatible, and physicists hope that they might ultimately be reconciled in a quantum theory of gravity. Whether such a theory would rescue cosmic censorship, says Matsas, remains to be seen. But he says that ?we don't see any compelling reason to preclude the existence of naked singularities in the context of quantum gravity?. Such an improved theory should in fact help make sense of what naked singularities are like in the first place. ?It is widely believed that quantum gravity will unveil the structure of the singularities,? says Matsas, adding that they will then probably seem ?quite benign to physics? rather than the monstrosities they now seem to be.

As an active volcano in Indonesia continues to rumble, scientists are keeping a keen eye on a dome of lava that is rising out of a lake in the volcano?s crater, hoping that worse is not to come. Indonesia has 129 active volcanoes, and Mount Kelut, on eastern Java, is one of the 66 with modern monitoring equipment. Since mid-October, tiltmeters on Mount Kelut have been registering deformation of the land, and seismometers have been recording tremors caused by magmatic activity. The temperature of the 2.5 million cubic metres of water in Kelut?s crater lake had also been rising, indicating that gas or magma was coming to the surface. The activity forced officials to raise disaster warnings to the highest level on 16 October and call for evacuations; an estimated 130,000 residents live within a 10-kilometre radius of the volcano. Since then there has been smoke and further activity, but no explosive eruption. The volcano has been deadly in the past. In 1919, an eruption killed some 5,000 people, mostly through muddy landslides as water from the volcano?s crater lake spilled over the sides. ?The water can travel at car speeds, 50 or 60 kilometres per hour, creating a mud flow that brings rocks of 2 or 3 metres in diameter with it,? says Masato Iguchi, a volcanologist at Kyoto University in Japan who has studied Indonesian volcanoes. The government has since built a 1.9-kilometre-long tunnel to help drain the volcanic lake to safer levels, carrying water to a local river.  Iguchi says that the current episode is worrying because the precursor signals ? land deformation and tremors ? have been going on for so long. ?The longer precursor period could mean the eruption will last for weeks or months,? he says.  \n              Volcanic plug \n            A dome of lava has been building in the crater lake since 3 November, which is probably a good sign. Surono, director of the Center for Vulcanology and Geological Hazard Mitigation in Bandung, says the lava dome is now some 150 metres in diameter at its base and reaches 70 metres above the water level. ?It?s growing very fast,? he says. ?Half the lake is probably taken up by lava now.? Much of the displaced water has either evaporated or been safely diverted through the tunnel to the river below, he says.  Surono says the lava dome might be relieving the magmatic pressure: the energy in the tremors and the amount of deformation have decreased over the past three days since their peak on 3 November, he says. ?It?s not so dangerous. I hope it will continue like this.?  Temperatures on site, however, remain high, indicating that danger still lurks. Some scientists have argued that the lava dome might be acting as a plug, and an explosive eruption may yet occur. For that reason, Surono says people should remain evacuated.

The incidence of malaria in some African countries may soon approach that of the eastern Mediterranean as a result of increased use of insecticide-treated mosquito bednets, spraying and more effective drugs. The first analyses of the effects of such interventions in the field indicate that they have had a direct and major effect on the malaria burden in Kenya and in Tanzania's Zanzibar archipelago. However, a lack of global coordination on eradication projects and poor data evaluation are jeopardizing malaria-control programmes in the worst-affected parts of the continent. Studies of the actual impact of control programmes on public health and mortality are surprisingly few, and as a result there is a worrying paucity of data. ?The biggest flaw in current malaria-control efforts is that we need to invest more in disease surveillance systems to know the true story of what is really happening in Africa,? says Mark Grabowsky, Malaria Program Manager at the Global Fund to fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. What's needed, says one prominent international health official who wishes to remain anonymous, is a greater international focus to put in place tools to compare data and standardize protocols. This has been achieved for diseases such as polio and measles, in which standardized data are available by district and month in Africa. There are no data of comparable quality for malaria, he says, adding that most reports of successes have been anecdotal. One study to evaluate the success of these programmes was carried out by Bob Snow's group at the Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI)-Wellcome Trust Collaborative Research Programme in Nairobi, and an international team. The researchers found that paediatric malaria admissions at hospitals on the Kenyan coast have fallen by up to 63% since 1999, as a result of interventions such as new drugs called artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) 1 . Snow's group also studied about 3,500 children in 72 rural areas of Kenya and found that bednet use was linked to a 44% reduction in mortality 2 . Snow says he is convinced that the decreases in malaria in Kenya are a direct result of the rise in bednet coverage in the zone between 2004 and 2006 from 7% to 67% of children, and the fact that 85% of rural clinics now stock ACTs that were non-existent only a few years ago. ?I think we are going through an epidemiological transition because of scaling up of intervention coverage,? says Snow, who believes that the epidemiology of malaria in many African countries is as a result shifting closer to that of the eastern Mediterranean region, where malaria incidence is at a more containable level of fewer than 10 in every 1,000, compared with 350 in every 1,000 Africans. Data from Zanzibar, published this week by Achuyt Bhattarai at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm and his colleagues, also show that malaria deaths dropped to one-quarter of previous levels between 2002 and 2005 after the introduction of ACTs and widened use of bednets 3 . Similarly encouraging preliminary data are coming in from Ethiopia, Eritrea, Mozambique, South Africa and Rwanda. But collecting and analysing rigorous data is difficult. Snow had to ensure that his data covered a long enough period, and that his models accounted for rainfall and other factors that make teasing out the direct impact of interventions difficult. Until now, most of the data have emerged in a fragmented way from organizations with a vested interest in the figures released. A report that has been billed as a success story, released by the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) on 17 October, showed that annual global production of insecticide-treated bednets soared from 30 million nets in 2004 to 63 million nets in 2006, and orders of artemisinin jumped from 3 million doses in 2003 to 100 million in 2006. But experts argue that such organizations often release data more for advocacy than to assess operations. The spin on the figures masks the fact that all countries are far short of the targets set by Rollback Malaria of 80% coverage of all interventions by 2010 ? most have not achieved a fraction of that. One key test will be in Zambia, in a programme launched in 2005 and funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. It aims to reduce deaths from malaria by 75% by 2008, through a huge scale-up of bednets, drugs and house spraying. Results submitted for publication show that in households with bednets, parasite prevalence in children and anaemia in infants fell from about 20% to 13%. At the end of 2006, the project had 20% of children under bednets; 40% of households owned a net; and spraying reached 34% of targeted households. In absolute terms these are still ?miserably low numbers?, points out one expert, adding that the overall malaria effort falls far short of its own targets. The few countries where progress on mortality is being reported all fall within zones in Africa that are moderate both in terms of the intensity of transmission (the number of infected mosquito bites per person) and the length of the malaria season. No one has yet shown a reduction of malaria in countries such as the Democratic Republic of Congo and Nigeria, where transmission rates are so high that preventative measures might have little impact on mortality. These two countries alone account for around half of malaria mortality in Africa, but poor management and health systems mean that they remain laggards in implementing malaria control measures, let alone evaluating their impact. \n                     Malaria special \n                   \n                     Malaria web focus \n                   \n                     Nature Insight: Malaria \n                   \n                     Roll Back Malaria Partnership \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Talks about approaching the oil company ExxonMobil as a possible meeting sponsor are raising tempers at the European Geosciences Union (EGU) in Strasbourg, France. Some scientists fear that sponsorship from the company would damage the integrity of the organization. The EGU council argued over its options at a meeting on 12 October, but made no decision as to which companies should be approached. But  Nature  has learned that ExxonMobil is likely to be on a list of possible sponsors that the council has asked John Ludden, the EGU's vice-president, to compile in the upcoming weeks. The 25-member council did agree that it would need to discuss and agree on potential sponsors before they were approached. If it could not reach a consensus, an ethics committee ? the members of which will be appointed shortly ? would weigh in. ExxonMobil, which last year reported record earnings of US$39.5 billion, donates tens of millions of dollars every year to universities and scientific organizations, including the American Geophysical Union (AGU) in Washington DC. However, the company has been criticized in the past for also funding climate sceptic groups that critics say attempt to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action against global warming. The company has now stopped funding some of these groups, such as the Competitive Enterprise Institute in Washington DC. And its 2006 corporate citizen report states that ?it is prudent to develop and implement strategies? to deal with rising greenhouse-gas emissions. Unlike its American sister organization, the EGU ? which launched in 2002 as a merger of two other groups ? has not accepted funding from private sponsors. ExxonMobil did fund a student lunch during the EGU's 2006 meeting in Vienna, Austria, but the event, which was to help students make contact with potential employers, was not an official part of the conference. The EGU's annual meetings, which attract some 8,000 scientists, generate most of the group's income. But the high registration fee ? up to ?400 (US$577) next year ? is not affordable for many scientists and students from poorer countries. ?We're not going to go bankrupt,? says Ludden. ?But in order to attract more scientists from Africa and eastern Europe we really should start looking for suitable sponsors.? Like many geologists, for whom oil companies are the main non-academic employers, Ludden says that he has no problems with accepting funds from the oil industry. He hopes that introducing sponsors will raise several hundred thousand euros per year for student sponsorship, teachers' education and for underwriting the costs of new journals. Tim Killeen, president of the AGU, says that issues of sponsorship there ?have been a topic of lively discussion for many years?. In the European group, dissent is led mainly by climate scientists and those outside the solid-earth community. ?Although we should be open to various types of interaction with industry, we shouldn't approach certain companies just because they're free with money,? says Hermann Held, chair of the EGU's division for energy, resources and the environment.

With their 'wings' and spooky, haunting eyes, they look more like something from a comic book than a zoology textbook. But an evolutionary study shows that colugos are the closest living relative of primates. Colugos ? nicknamed 'flying lemurs', although confusingly they can't really fly and aren't lemurs ? might look like an unlikely candidate as the closest cousin to primates, the group that includes monkeys, apes and humans. But evolutionary geneticists have discovered that we are more closely related to these squirrel-like tree-dwellers than we are to other non-primate mammals. Researchers led by William Murphy of Texas A&M University in College Station compared DNA from dozens of species, including primates, colugos, tree shrews, rodents and other mammals, to search for genetic changes that would reveal when the groups branched off from one another during evolution. Evidence of insertion or deletion of specific genetic sequences in each species helped to construct an accurate evolutionary tree. As the team reports in  Science , colugos emerged as the most recent non-primate group to branch off from our lineage, some 86 million years ago. Evolutionary biologists previously knew that both tree shrews and colugos branched away from the human lineage at about this time, but they didn't know which one was closest. \"It was difficult to prise them apart,\" Murphy says. The team's work shows that colugos branched off roughly a million years later than shrews.  \n              Non-flying non-lemurs \n            Back then, all land mammals would have been quite small, shrew-like insect-eaters, Murphy says. The animal kingdom was still ruled by the dinosaurs. Only after the dinosaurs' demise, roughly 65 million years ago, did mammals really begin to diversify into the many shapes and sizes we see today. Today, colugos are represented by two species:  Cynocephalus,  which lives in the Philippines and is listed by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources as 'vulnerable'; and  Galeopterus,  which is distributed more widely throughout Southeast Asia. True lemurs, from which colugos gain their 'flying lemur' sobriquet, are primates, alongside monkeys, apes and ourselves.  So how did colugos end up with such a confusing nickname? \"It's probably because they glide ? they're not truly flying ? and they look somewhat fuzzy, like a lemur,\" Murphy suggests.  The animal, which is by no means famous at present, may soon find itself pushed into the scientific limelight as a result of its place on the evolutionary tree. Murphy and his colleagues are calling for the colugo to be added to the list of animals, including some 30 different mammals, that are set to have their genomes sequenced. A complete genetic handbook for colugos would be a useful tool for researchers to compare the genes of different primate species. And, says Murphy, it might help us deduce what the very first true primate species might have looked like. \n                   Chimp genome special \n                 \n                   More evolution and palaeontology \n                 \n                   IUCN Red List of Threatened Species \n                 Reprints and Permissions"},

Just a whiff of the urine from snow leopards sends shivers down the spines of normal mice. But deleting a key group of olfactory cells turns mice fearless in the face of this odour ? even though the mice can still smell it, and be taught to fear it later in life. The surprising result suggests that smells pass through distinct circuits along the path from nose to brain: one for innate fear, another for the learned kind. A single smell could activate both paths at the same time. When a scent ? noxious or pleasant ? hits the nose of a mouse or any mammal, it activates a combination of olfactory neurons. Mice boast about a thousand types of these neurons, which reach from the nose to the brain. The combination of cells activated, like the notes in a piano chord, determines the scent experienced by the animal. The olfactory neurons are located in a special structure in the nasal cavity called the olfactory epithelium, which has two major regions: dorsal and ventral. The olfactory neurons in each region differ at the molecular level, but until now, no one had much idea how the regions differed in their wiring. From the olfactory epithelium, the neurons connect to a brain structure called the olfactory bulb. The organization of neurons in the epithelium is mimicked in the brain ? the neurons are mapped out in the same way.  \n              Eau de fox \n            To determine the difference between the dorsal and ventral neurons, Hitoshi Sakano, a neuroscientist at the University of Tokyo, and his team engineered a strain of mice that had no olfactory neurons in their dorsal epithelium. They then tested the mice for their response to a handful smells, good and bad. Normal mice were drawn to smells of peanut butter and mouse urine; but couldn?t flee fast enough from the scents of rotting food, fox glands, and the urine of snow leopards. But mice without these neurons showed less interest in the sweet smells and little aversion to spine-tingling ones, the team reports in  Nature 1 . The mice could still detect these smells, the researchers found, and could learn to hate the odours if researchers made the mice sick while delivering the 'nasty' smells. The team concludes that the dorsal olfactory neurons transmit innate fear responses to the brain, whereas the ventral neurons convey learned aversion. The team could also see a difference in the brain. In normal mice, a scent secreted by fox anal glands called trimethyl-thiazoline stimulates the brain to make adrenocorticotropic hormone, a sign of stress. The fearless mutants showed no such stimulation in response to the scent. The work is a big step forward in explaining how odours are translated into actions, says Catherine Dulac, a neuroscientist at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts.  Humans probably have a similar system for discerning smells, says Sakano. But learned behaviours can sometimes over-rule innate ones, he notes. Natto ? fermented soya beans ? is a popular snack in Tokyo, despite its rancid smell. \"I think an innate smell will tell us it's dangerous and don't eat it,\" says Sakano. \"But based on the associative learning, some people in the Tokyo area learn to like it.\" \n                   Sakano Lab \n                 Reprints and Permissions"},

Six potential landing sites have been chosen for NASA's Mars Science Laboratory, a large rover set to assess the past habitability of sites on the planet's surface, when it lands in October 2010 (See  image ). The shortlist, chosen from dozens of possibilities, includes craters partly filled with sediment, an ancient flood channel and regions rich in clay minerals thought to date from an era when the martian surface was wetter than it is today. However, changes to the mission's scope mean that options that might offer excellent science could end up being dismissed as impractical. The mission has a 'landing ellipse' roughly 20 kilometres across to account for the uncertainties involved in guiding a spacecraft over millions of kilometres to a soft landing on a windy planet. The terrain in the ellipse needs to be smooth and flat. ?If you ask an engineer, they'd like to land in a Walmart parking lot,? says Jack Mustard, a planetary geologist at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island. As originally conceived, once landed, the rover would have been able to travel well outside this ellipse to places neither smooth nor flat ? the sorts of outcrop that geologists favour. But participants at last month's workshop to choose the candidate sites, hosted by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, found that sites where the rover would need to travel 10 kilometres or more to obtain samples were now being flagged as possibly problematic. ?I would have been screaming at that,? says Ken Edgett, of Malin Space Science Systems of San Diego, who is a principal investigator on the mission but was unable to attend the workshop because of the wildfires in California. ?It limits your expectations,? says Mustard, who favours a site in the Nili Fossae region from which the rover would be able, if all went well, to sally forth to a region of dramatic erosion that he has dubbed Monument Valley. Changes in the way that the rover's moving parts will be lubricated raise issues for sites in the planet's southern highlands, as they reduce the rover's capabilities in winter conditions. Nevertheless, the scientists shortlisted two southern sites as worthy of further study. One of them, Holden Crater, contains what seem to be lake sediments and a delta. ?It's awesome,? says Mustard. The shortlisted sites will now be scrutinized further by instruments on board NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, which is currently circling the planet. At the same time, computer models will assess the risk of winds at the sites being strong enough to mess up the landing. It is very unlikely that all six will be considered too risky, says John Grant of the Smithsonian Institution's Center for Earth and Planetary Studies in Washington DC and co-chair of the site-selection committee.

A modified form of a commonly used pesticide may one day provide farmers with a new weapon against the development of resistance among insect pests.  The new compound is a modified version of the 'Bt' toxins ? a class of chemicals that specifically target caterpillars and are naturally produced by the bacterium  Bacillus thuringiensis . Farmers have long used Bt sprays to protect their crops, and cotton and corn engineered to make the toxin themselves have been grown for more than a decade. In 2006, more than 30 million hectares worldwide were planted with Bt crops. The shift from periodic crop spraying to growing plants that continuously produce the toxin has the potential to accelerate the emergence of Bt-resistant insects. \"It?s almost inevitable that there will be more resistance to Bt toxins now that they?re being used much more widely,\" says Bruce Tabashnik, an entomologist at the University of Arizona in Tucson, and a member of the research team. Thus far, those concerns have yet to materialize. Resistance has only been documented in the field for two insects: diamondback moths ( Plutella xylostella ) and cabbage loopers ( Trichoplusia ni ), both of which produce larvae that munch their way through vegetable crops. The resistant insects have been found in fields and greenhouses that were sprayed with Bt, but surprisingly not in fields sown with Bt-producing plants. Researchers and regulators continue to monitor the threat of resistance, and to look for new weapons against the plant pests. \"Right now it?s more about the potential for Bt resistance than the documented cases,\" says Tabashnik.  \n              Resist the resistance \n            Now, Mario Sober\u00a3n and Alejandra Bravo of the National Autonomous University of Mexico in Morelos and their colleagues have designed a new way to stave off pests by modifying the Bt toxins so that they resist insect resistance. Bt toxins work by binding specific receptors found only in insect guts. Molecules of Bt then clump together and produce holes in cell membranes. The most common way for insects to dodge this grim fate is by reducing the ability of the toxin to bind to those receptors.  The researchers found that when they deleted a specific region of a Bt toxin, the toxin no longer needed to bind to a receptor before it could kill its host. They tested two versions of the new toxin against Bt-resistant pink bollworms ( Pectinophora gossypiella ) reared in the lab. The bollworms were at least a hundred times more susceptible to one form of the modified Bt toxin than to the natural compound, the researchers report in  Science . Another version of the modified toxin killed all of the 'resistant' bollworms. ?These targeted modifications to produce designer toxins could really help in controlling resistance,? says David Andow, an entomologist at the University of Minnesota in St Paul. But more tests need to be completed before modified Bt can be unleashed in the field.  The modified toxin will probably require more evaluation to ensure its safety in humans, notes Andow. If the toxin passes those tests, he says, ?we?ll have a new way to proceed?. Meanwhile, whether the modified Bt toxin could be used to create a new generation of genetically modified crops depends on how the protein fares inside a plant cell, warns entomologist William Moar of Auburn University in Alabama. Some proteins are produced only at low levels, or are degraded by plant enzymes soon after their production.  Meanwhile, biotech firms have already been actively evaluating other options. Some farmers now grow transgenic crops that contain two different Bt toxins that bind to separate receptors. The hope is that the insects will have to become resistant to both toxins, a process that would presumably take longer than developing resistance to only one. And researchers are developing plants that produce an entirely different toxin, normally made by bacteria that live in nematode worm guts. Moar agrees that the modified Bt could make a useful addition to the pesticide arsenal. ?The more options we have, the more we can rotate crops and the better off we are for fighting resistance,? he says. \n                   GM Crops In Focus \n                 \n                   Food and the Future Insight \n                 \n                   Bruce Tabashnik \n                 \n                   David Andow \n                 \n                   William Moar \n                 Reprints and Permissions"},

It is expected to cost US$170 million to build and should be online by 2012. Home for the India-based Neutrino Observatory (INO) will be a man-made cave about 2 kilometres beneath the tallest peak of the Nilgiri Hills, 250 kilometres south of Bangalore. The rock above it will shield the observatory from unwanted cosmic radiation. Initially, the lab will study neutrinos produced by cosmic rays in Earth's atmosphere. ?A large experiment whose goal is to study atmospheric neutrinos has never been built,? says Maury Goodman, a neutrino physicist at Argonne National Laboratory in Illinois. ?In that way the INO is unique and important.? The INO will use a 50,000-tonne magnetized iron calorimeter to detect particles called muons that are produced on the rare occasions that neutrinos interact with matter. Because the detector can distinguish between muons with a positive and a negative charge, says Mondal, it should help researchers to work out the respective masses of the three types of neutrino. John Learned, a physicist at the University of Hawaii at Manoa in Honolulu, says the iron detector is an ?excellent choice? that will also allow the study of neutrino 'oscillations' ? when one type of neutrino changes into another as it travels through space. The INO aims to recapture the pioneering spirit of studies in a gold mine in Kolar, southern India, which led to the detection of atmospheric neutrinos in 1965. But the facility was abandoned in 1992, and many researchers left for abroad. Now, India wants to revitalize its neutrino physics community. The INO collaboration currently includes at least 100 scientists from 18 Indian institutions and the University of Hawaii.

Autumn leaves turn fiery-red in an attempt to store up as much goodness as possible from leaves and soil before a tree settles down for the winter. The worse the quality of soil, the more effort a tree will put in to recovering nutrients from its leaves, and the redder they get. That's the conclusion that Emily Habinck from the University of North Carolina, Charlotte, came to after looking at trees in a flood plain and in an adjacent upland area. The soil in the upland area was low in nutrients, and the leaves there were bright red. In the floodplain, where the soil was packed full of goodness, the autumn leaves remained yellow. \"In a nutshell: the redder a leaf is, the more nutrients it is going to recycle,\" explains Habinck, who presents her findings at the Geological Society of America?s annual meeting in Denver, Colorado, today.  \n              It's not easy being red \n            Unlikely as it may seem, colour changes in leaves are not fully understood ? at least not when it comes to the redder hues.  As autumn approaches, trees begin to break down the green chlorophyll in their leaves and redistribute the nutrients contained there to their trunk and roots. This keeps them going throughout the winter, when sunlight is sparse.  The yellow colour seen in some autumn trees results from the loss of chlorophyll simply unmasking the yellow carotinoids that were there all along. But red coloration comes from a pigment called anthocyanin, which has to be made afresh as autumn takes hold.  Why trees would bother to spend energy doing this as things are winding down for the winter has been widely debated. Some researchers have suggested that these pigments act as antioxidants, which help a tree combat harsh conditions. Others say it helps to attract birds that can then disperse fruits. Or it might increase leaf temperature, helping to protect from the cold.  \n              Sunscreen \n            Some people have observed that trees tend to turn redder when an autumn is particularly bright and cold. In 2001, William Hoch, now at Montana State University, Bozeman, suggested that the pigment acts as a protective sunscreen, helping to keep leaves on the trees for longer so that more nutrients can be harvested from them. Photosynthesis becomes more difficult as chlorophyll is broken down, and leaves become more susceptible to damage from the Sun. Damaged leaves will fall more quickly, and rid the tree of a nutrient supply.  Hoch did a study in which he made mutant trees that couldn't produce anthocyanins. These dropped their leaves while they were still green when exposed to the high-stress environment of bright light and cold temperatures. The mutant trees were much less efficient at storing up nitrogen for the winter. Habinck's study of natural sweetgum and red maple trees in a nature preserve in Charlotte supports this notion. Trees in the upland areas, where soils don't have much nitrogen, had much redder leaves than the trees in the flood-plain environment.  \"A plant on a nutrient-poor soil is going to be more concerned about keeping the nutrients it has,\" says Hoch. So it will turn red to stop its leaves dropping prematurely. Habinck's supervisor, Martha Eppes, now wants to look at satellite data to see whether there is a wider correlation between tree colour and soil type over large areas. \n                   GSA annual meeting 2007 \n                 Reprints and Permissions"},

When scientists released a draft of the human genome sequence six years ago, they said the data belonged to all of us \u2014 but until now, they have been the only ones able to play with the data therein. That's now starting to change. In the next few months, two Silicon Valley start-ups will start giving customers a peek at their genomes for a few thousand dollars a pop. A firm in Massachusetts is also offering people the opportunity to buy the whole sequence of their genome for an unspecified amount. And close behind these firms are corporations, such as Google, that are developing ways to store, analyse and profit from health information \u2014 including genetic data. The first start-up, 23andMe of Mountain View, California, plans to launch before the end of this year, and the second, Navigenics of Redwood Shores, hopes to do so by spring 2008. Both companies say that they will genotype millions of regions in customers' genomes, called single nucleotide polymorphisms or SNPs, which have been linked to a handful of diseases and nonmedical traits, such as earwax consistency. They then sell that information back to the customer. Navigenics will focus on medical conditions, says its chief scientific officer, Dietrich Stephan, a human geneticist at the Translational Genomics Research Institute in Phoenix, Arizona. It will use information from scientific studies to estimate composite risk factors for diseases based on each customer's SNPs, he says. It also plans to provide genetic counselling to help customers interpret these risk factors. The firm says that it will conduct long-term studies on how well those predictors work. By contrast, 23andMe will analyse not just medical information, but also traits not necessarily linked to disease. The firm will introduce a social networking component to genomics by allowing customers to link their data with others', such as family members, say advisers. It is also considering providing researchers with access to the data, they say. Advisers familiar with the firms say that there is a distinct difference between them. \"Navigenics might be the white coat and stethoscopes approach, and 23andMe might be about family and ancestry and who you inherited something from,\" says genome scientist George Church from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge. Church is an adviser for 23andMe, has had discussions with Navigenics and is also advising Knome, the Cambridge-based personal genome company that offers to sequence the whole genome. \"It's like the difference between IBM in the 1960s, which was about black ties and white shirts and shiny black shoes, and Google in the present time, which is a little more playful,\" he says.  Indeed, one of 23andMe's founders, Anne Wojcicki, is married to Google founder Sergey Brin, and Google has invested millions in her company. Google is developing its own suite of health tools to allow users to personalize and share health information, and many speculate that 23andMe will feed its data to Google. The prospect of Google working with health data has raised concerns about privacy. Google typically targets advertisements to customers from information they enter into search engines and from the content of their e-mail messages, raising the issue of how it would handle personalized health records and genetic data. Few laws govern such use of health or genetic information \u2014 a sobering fact, given that any individual can be identified by 100 SNPs or fewer (Z. Lin, A.B. Owen and R. B. Altman  Science    305  , 183; 2004). But many customers might not be bothered by the privacy issue, says John Halamka, chief information officer for Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, Massachusetts, and a Google adviser. \"Every one of us has a different threshold for privacy,\" he says.  \n                Share and share alike \n              In fact, Halamka will be sharing some of his genetic data with the world next month as part of the Personal Genome Project led by Church. The project is releasing genetic and other types of data on ten volunteers as an experiment to test how such data are used, or misused, by participants and the public (see ' Genetic test claims AIDS insight ').  Church points out that hundreds of thousands of people have already paid for services that analyse the ancestral origins of their DNA. So companies such as 23andMe and Navigenics are likely to make money in the short term.  But whether the firms stick around will depend on whether they prove their worth, says Kathy Hudson, director of the Johns Hopkins Genetics and Public Policy Center in Washington DC. Hudson points out that the power of SNP-based tests is still very limited, so a whole-genome scan can't tell you much that you can't find out another, cheaper way.  \"My real question is: why are you getting a genetic test to find out if you have sticky earwax?\" Hudson asks. \"I don't need a genetic test; I've got my Q-tips.\" \n                     Nature Omics Gateway \n                   \n                     James Watson genome browser \n                   \n                     Personal Genome Project \n                   \n                     Genetics and Public Policy Center Issue Brief on Direct-to-Consumer Genetic Testing \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

The chief science adviser to President George W. Bush came under fire last week for his role in watering down congressional testimony on the health effects of global warming.  Julie Gerberding, director of the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, Georgia, had briefed senators on the subject at a hearing on 23 October. As required, she submitted her written testimony 24 hours in advance to the White House ? which then proceeded to chop it in half. Detailed comments from the office of John Marburger, the president's science adviser and director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP), may have played a part. Six pages of missing material focused on a range of potential public- health impacts related to climate change. These included the effects of heat waves, air pollution, extreme weather and infectious diseases. The original testimony also indicated that children, the elderly and the poor would bear the brunt of the impact, and suggested that these problems \"remain largely unaddressed\". Officials at the Centers for Disease Control maintain that Gerberding's testimony was accurate and complete, especially when combined with what she told the committee verbally. But congressional Democrats and advocacy groups immediately denounced the White House, citing a history of allegations that the administration has misrepresented science in order to promote its own policies. \"Considering the track record, this administration should be bending over backwards to allow critical scientific evidence to reach the public,\" says Tim Donaghy of the Union of Concerned Scientists, an advocacy group based in Cambridge, Massachusetts.  Marburger insists that his office did not seek to cut the report, but instead made \"substantive and constructive comments and suggestions\". Those comments were passed to the White House Office of Management and Budget, which coordinates such agency reviews. Owing to time constraints, the budget office elected to strike the sections rather than revise the testimony, according to OSTP officials. Donaghy acknowledges that Marburger's comments are technically accurate, but he says the administration had a responsibility to correct the errors rather than cutting the meat out of the testimony. \"The topic of the hearing was climate change and public health,\" he says. \"It's not too much to ask to have them submit testimony on that particular topic.\" The budget office referred all questions on the matter to the White House press office, which declined to discuss the issue. At the time  Nature  went to press, the OSTP had said that it would not release the full version of its suggested edits, as such reviews were an \"internal process\". But in a written statement, Marburger offered several examples of what he called an \"overall lack of precision\" in the proposed testimony, and cited what he claimed were technical conflicts with the latest assessment by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). For instance, Marburger flagged a statement indicating that global warming is expected to alter the \"frequency, timing, intensity and duration of extreme weather events such as hurricanes and floods\". But researchers have made links between global warming and hurricanes primarily for storm intensity, and even on that point there remains considerable debate.   Marburger also said that the report improperly characterized certain global impacts as domestic impacts, and failed to acknowledge that, in some cases such as agriculture, the impact in the United States might be beneficial. He also noted that the effects on mental health anticipated by the IPCC relate to post-disaster trauma, not the anticipation of global warming as stated in the testimony. Senator Barbara Boxer (Democrat, California), who chairs the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works that called Gerberding to testify, has asked the White House for copies of all records related to the testimony. She calls Marburger's explanation a \"lame defence\". \n                   Union of Concerned Scientists \n                 \n                   Senate committee hearing \n                 Reprints and Permissions"},

China's Moon exploration programme has kicked off with the launch of its first lunar orbiter. Launched on 24 October from Sichuan province in southwest China, the orbiter is a small step in an ambitious, and not yet official, plan to send astronauts to the Moon sometime after 2020. But its significance lies in China's hopes of becoming the fifth power to put a probe into lunar orbit. ?It's a technological confidence-builder,? says Joan Johnson-Freese, a China space analyst at the Naval War College in Newport, Rhode Island. As is often the case when China flexes its muscles, the world has taken notice. Analysts say China's space programme is spurring competition among its Asian neighbours, even as it seeks assistance and collaboration from Europe. Meanwhile, the United States, wary of military competition in space following China's anti-satellite weapons test in January, is monitoring the programme carefully. The 2.3-tonne, US$190-million Chang'e-1 spacecraft ? named after a mythical Chinese goddess whom legend says flew to the Moon ? rode on a Long March 3A rocket that blasted off from the Xichang launch centre. If all goes to plan, by 5 November the probe will have parked itself in an orbit around the Moon. It will then begin a year-long geological and mineralogical analysis as it inspects the surface for future landing sites. Chang'e is carrying a camera and an altimeter to build a three-dimensional map of the lunar surface, spectrometers to determine the Moon's elemental composition, a radiometer to map soil depths by measuring reflected microwaves, and detectors to monitor the solar wind. That will set the stage for Chang'e-2, which aims to land a rover on the Moon by 2012. The rover would transmit video footage and analyse soil samples. Scientists in Shanghai are developing a nuclear-powered prototype that resembles NASA's current Mars rovers Spirit and Opportunity, although it is not clear if China's space agency will select this design. A possible subsequent Chang'e-3 mission would gather lunar rock samples and return them to Earth. China's space missions are organized as five-year plans, each designed to make significant technological advances over the previous one. ?By Western standards, it's painfully slow,? says Phillip Clark, head of the Molniya Space Consultancy in Hastings, UK, who has studied the history of China's space programme. Johnson-Freese notes that the Chang'e missions are exploratory science missions managed by the nominally civilian China National Space Administration, as opposed to China's manned missions, which are under the control of the People's Liberation Army. In 2003, the Shenzhou 5 mission carried the nation's first astronaut, Yang Liwei, into orbit, making China the third country to do this after the United States and the Soviet Union. Two astronauts flew aboard Shenzhou 6 in 2005. A spacewalk is the next milestone, planned for next year. Eventually, the capabilities of the two programmes are expected to merge. But there have been few official pronouncements from the top levels of government. A deputy commander for the Shenzhou programme has said China could have people on the Moon by 2020; Clark thinks such a date is optimistic, but possible. Top Communist Party officials have avoided committing to a specific date, probably for fear of making it too much of a competition with the United States, says Vincent Sabathier, director for space initiatives at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington DC. ?They're trying to avoid this race,? he says. Yet in September, NASA administrator Michael Griffin evoked the language of the old US?Soviet space race when he said China might very well beat America in sending astronauts back to the Moon. Some observers, including Johnson-Freese, say this was perhaps more a case of Griffin expressing his frustrations with NASA's progress in returning to the Moon than a reflection of any race with China ? after the Chang'e launch, Griffin sent congratulations to his Chinese counterpart. NASA is planning to launch its own Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter into a low polar orbit late in 2008. China has made a few overtures towards working in space with other governments, suggesting that it might want to join the International Space Station. The European Space Agency has encouraged such collaboration, for instance allowing China to test its tracking stations for Chang'e by following the 2003 launch of Europe's SMART-1 lunar orbiter. Any new space race will be mainly in Asia, says Sabathier. In September, Japan launched its SELENE mission, a sophisticated lunar orbiter nicknamed Kaguya, which has reached lunar orbit and released two small satellites. It is checking its instruments and will begin measurements in December. Meanwhile, India is planning to launch a lunar orbiter and impactor in April, called Chandrayaan-1, with potentially a rover to follow. \n                     China National Space Administration \n                   \n                     NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter \n                   \n                     Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency's Kaguya \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Alison Abbott reports. Dangle a mouse by its tail, and it will wriggle and strain to escape before eventually recognizing the hopelessness of its situation. Measure the time it takes to abandon thoughts of helping itself, and you have one of the classic animal tests for depression. Except it's not, says Laurence Tecott, a research psychiatrist at the University of California, San Francisco. \"We can't say that that mouse is depressed, and we can't say you would be if you were strung up by your tail,\" he says. The reason we have not seen a genuinely new class of drug in psychiatry for 50 years, he asserts, is largely because animal models are woefully inadequate representations of human-specific disorders. You'll hear the same story from many others. But things are not as hopeless for scientists as they may seem for the dangling mouse; some recent papers offer tantalizing hints of a way forward. \"No one is going to create a mouse model of suicidality,\" says Eric Nestler, a neuroscientist at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas. \"But sensible models of important aspects of the neurobiology underpinning psychiatric disorders are just around the corner.\" Classical animal tests for psychiatric disorders are based on responses to clinically proven drugs. What the tests don't necessarily do, however, is reflect the cause or the biological basis of the disorder they are supposed to mimic. Most researchers agree that it's time to apply recent findings about the human brain to creating more useful mouse models \u2014 often by deleting, adding or mutating candidate susceptibility genes. For instance, scientists have already modelled a core symptom \u2014 abnormal social relations \u2014 of several autism-related disorders 1 ,   2 . And schizophrenia, a disorder believed to result in part from faulty neurodevelopment, has also been a focus of recent research, because a particularly strong candidate gene has been identified \u2014 that encoding the protein DISC-1.  \n                Head start \n              Psychiatrist Akira Sawa, from the Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland, for example, has created transgenic mice with a disrupted  Disc-1   gene and used brain scanning to show that such mice have enlarged brain ventricles \u2014 especially on the left side \u2014 as is usually seen in humans with schizophrenia 3 . \"This brain anatomy is a very objective characteristic of schizophrenia,\" says Sawa. \"And being able to reproduce it in mice with the candidate association gene further supports the hypothesis that DISC-1 is involved in schizophrenia.\" His lab is now looking at proteins that interact with DISC-1 in key biochemical signalling pathways, and how environmental factors such as stress may affect the system. Alcino Silva, a research psychiatrist at the University of California, Los Angeles, has gone a step further. His team has created a 'conditional mutant' mouse, in which the  Disc-1   gene can be switched on or off at will. He found that activation of the gene on just one specific day \u2014 the seventh after birth \u2014 was sufficient to cause a range of symptoms analogous to those seen in schizophrenia later in life 4 . The mice developed specific types of memory deficit and depressive-like behaviours, and were less sociable with other mice. In addition, the hippocampus, a part of the brain that is important in memory, had notably different anatomy at the cellular level. \"When we went back to look at natural mutations in the gene in humans, we found that the mutation was correlated with reduced sociability,\" says Silva. \"This may not be an accurate model of schizophrenia, but it is telling us a lot about the disease.\" Few, if any, scientists want or expect to recreate an entire psychiatric disorder in a mouse. This would be beside the point, not least because current clinical diagnostic criteria, such as those enshrined in the  Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disease 5  (DSM-IV for the fourth, and current, edition) are also considered inadequate. Most neuroscientists and psychiatrists agree that they add to confusion by giving names to clusters of symptoms that overlap with each other. \"Schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, as defined by DSM-IV, share many symptoms, as do anxiety and depression,\" says neuroscientist Steve Hyman, provost of Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts. \"The emerging models focus on biomarkers of specific symptoms, rather than a DSM label.\"  \n                Circuit breaker \n              Particularly valuable biomarkers, says Hyman, are the neural circuits relevant to disease that have been identified in people using techniques such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), which measures changes in oxygenation of blood flowing through the brain. For example, a circuit that runs between the portion of the cortex at the front of the brain, and the striatum and the thalamus deeper in the brain, has been associated with obsessive-compulsive disorder. The symptoms of this disorder can sometimes be alleviated by drugs such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), which enhance the effects of the neurotransmitter serotonin. Guoping Feng, a neurobiologist at Duke University Medical Center in Durham, North Carolina, hit this target in mice, although not by design. Six years ago, he knocked out a gene in mice called  Sapap3 , which encodes a key protein involved in regulating receptors for the neurotransmitter glutamate. He noticed that the genetically altered mice groomed themselves until they bled. At first, he had no idea why. He put things together when he remembered that SAPAP3 is the only member of the SAPAP protein family that is highly expressed in the striatum. And he thus ended up with the first model in which specific disturbances in this neural circuit are associated with a compulsive-like behaviour 6 . Selectively expressing the missing gene in the striatum alleviated the abnormal behaviour, as did giving the mice SSRIs. \"Drug companies have contacted us about testing small molecules they have in their cupboards which regulate glutamate receptors,\" says Feng. Such research is also stimulating companies to rethink their approach to testing drugs. During recent decades, the available arsenal of psychiatric drugs has been fine-tuned so that fewer patients have severe side effects. But there has been little improvement in efficacy. SSRIs don't work in one-third of patients with depression, for example, and antipsychotic drugs have little impact on the debilitating cognitive deficits of schizophrenia, even though they control disruptive symptoms such as hallucinations. \"Current tests continue to pick up drugs that work through the same old mechanisms,\" says Michael Spedding, director of research at the pharmaceutical company Servier in Paris, \"which is why most schizophrenia drugs target the dopamine system, even though that's not good enough therapeutically.\" Spedding is now trying to develop surrogates in animals that involve the relevant neural circuits. Mark Tricklebank, head of science at Eli Lilly's Centre for Cognitive Neuroscience in Windlesham, Surrey, UK, says that many industrial pharmacologists are starting to change their approach in this way. His group, for instance, is developing an oxygen electrode to measure blood-oxygenation levels directly in particular areas of the brain in rodents, as a surrogate of fMRI signals seen in humans. But it will be some years before the new approach becomes mainstream. \"Trying to make drugs is a ferociously complex process,\" says Paul Chapman, head of GlaxoSmithKline's Centre for Research in Cognitive and Neurodegenerative Disorders in Singapore, \"and tolerance to risk varies from company to company\". The stakes are huge. A sixth-generation SSRI, Lexapro (escitalopram), has so far made almost US$2 billion for New-York-based Forest Laboratories; by contrast, the last major attempt to launch a genuinely new psychiatric drug, based on the neurotransmitter substance P, failed to show efficacy in several clinical trials for depression. But it is also early days scientifically. Neuroscientists are quick to point out that their new knowledge about the brain is still preliminary and sketchy. Current candidate association genes are just that \u2014 candidates. And the interesting neural circuits are not proven disease mechanisms, just promising correlates. In the meantime, Tecott is preparing to unveil a new approach to assessing mouse behaviours. It's a holistic approach, whereby the 'lifestyle' of a mouse is assessed in its home cage \u2014 a very particular home, where every move is monitored in space and time, along with every lick, every milligram of food eaten, and every snooze. The data can then be mined for information about patterns of behavioural change in the short and long term, for example during the female reproductive cycle, or as a consequence of drug administration. \"Looking at spontaneous behaviour is like looking at brain function on display,\" says Tecott. \"This will help open up ways of finding new psychiatric drugs at last.\" \n                     Laurence Tecott's website \n                   \n                     Akira Sawa's website \n                   \n                     Alcino Silva's website \n                   \n                     Guoping Feng's website \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Two children with a common neurodegenerative disease are seeing early signs of success from a pioneering gene-therapy treatment, researchers report this week.  The results raise hopes for a treatment for adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD), and, the researchers add, mark the first successful use of an attenuated HIV virus to carry a therapeutic gene into a patient?s cells. HIV is a promising vector for transferring corrective genes into a host ? it can penetrate directly into cell nuclei, making it a theoretically efficient way to introduce new genetic material. But until now it hadn?t been proven in a clinical setting. This early success potentially opens the door to better treatments for many other diseases involving the bone marrow and blood cells, such as leukaemia, thalassemia and sickle-cell disease, the researchers say. The results, from two 7-year-old Spanish children with ALD, were announced on Sunday 28 October at the fifteenth Congress of the European Society of Gene and Cell Therapy in Rotterdam, the Netherlands  ALD is caused by a mutation on the X chromosome. This mutation causes degradation of the insulating sheaths that surround neurons and allow them to signal properly. The condition was made famous by  Lorenzo's Oil , the Hollywood film outlining one family?s fight to help their son. The most severe, cerebral form of ALD affects one in 17,000 people, with two-thirds of sufferers being children. It progresses slowly at first, but if no bone-marrow transplant is available it can quickly progress to cause brain damage and death. At present, treatment is limited to giving preventative dietary supplements and therapeutic bone-marrow transplants, with the attendant shortages of donor tissue.  \n              Word of caution \n            Patrick Aubourg and Natalie Cartier, researchers at Inserm (France's national biomedical agency) who were working at the Saint Vincent de Paul Hospital in Paris, attempted to fix the X-chromosome defect using gene therapy. Working in collaboration with the Californian biotech company Cell Genesys, they first cultured the children's bone-marrow progenitor cells ? which give rise to all blood cell types ? and transferred the corrective gene to them using the HIV virus. They then destroyed the children's existing bone marrow using chemotherapy, and reintroduced the modified cells, which took hold within a month to produce new bone marrow and blood cells. Samples taken showed that half of the new cells contained the introduced gene, and that 20-30% expressed the corrective protein. Such expression levels in gene therapy are \"exceptional\" says Aubourg. The levels have remained stable for more than two months in the children, despite the fact that the cells involved are replenished every 24 hours. Aubourg is keen to emphasize that although the initial results are encouraging, caution is warranted. The children will need to be closely monitored to check the safety of the procedure, with the main risk being that they might develop leukaemia as a result of the risk of mutagenesis during gene transfer. Many previous gene-therapy trials have failed because of serious problems with side effects.  It will also take another 18 months of follow-up before the team can be reasonably sure that their gene transfer remains stable, and that the level of corrective protein expressed is sufficient to prevent clinical symptoms from developing, he says. Both children are so far doing as well as would be expected following conventional bone-marrow transplants, he adds. Aubourg announced the findings before publication because of the field's intense interest in using attenuated HIV vectors in gene therapy for other diseases. Given the higher efficiency of such vectors, demonstrating their feasibility would mark a \"breakthrough in gene therapy\", he says. Quickly informing the field was a viable idea, says Laurence Tiennot-Herment, president of the French Muscular Dystrophy Association, which has funded Aubourg's work for a decade. \"But we must wait and see, as there is no publication yet, and there are safety and other issues to consider,\" she adds. \"I'm very cautious for the present, but it's an important step.\" \n                   Biotechnology@nature.com  \n                 \n                   Biotechnology \n                 \n                   Neuroscience \n                 \n                   Cell Therapies \n                 Reprints and Permissions"},

But as Andrea Chipman reports, there's more to the data than meets the eye. Industrial research and development (R&D) in Europe is surging ahead ? but perhaps not quickly enough. Those are the main findings of an exhaustive study undertaken by the European Commission to pin down what big corporate laboratories are up to. The survey was undertaken after Europe's leaders identified performance in industrial R&D as a crucial factor in keeping European economies competitive. The 2007 European Union (EU) Industrial R&D Investment Scoreboard, released last month, surveyed the 1,000 biggest R&D spenders in the European Union, and the same number of companies elsewhere. ?We are trying to look at the benefits of R&D,? says H\u00e9ctor Hern\u00e1ndez, one of the survey's authors, who is based at the European Commission's Institute for Prospective Technological Studies in Seville, Spain. ?We are presenting facts, with a minimum of analysis. It's useful for companies to see where they are ? and we are interested in the policy implications,? he says. The exercise is an imperfect one: published data are not always the most accurate guide to the research that actually goes on, and many economists question the correlation between R&D spending and real innovation. But it nonetheless shows up some of the major ways in which global R&D is taking shape. The scoreboard found, for example, that investment by the top spenders in the European Union rose by 7.4% last year ? by far the highest growth recorded since the exercise began in 2002. But the firms still lagged behind their competitors in the rest of the world, whose R&D investment grew by an astonishing 11.1% in 2006 (see left-hand graph). The survey also indicated that the pharmaceutical industry is now the largest single industrial sector worldwide in terms of R&D investment, displacing technology hardware and equipment from that slot. Symbolizing that trend, Pfizer replaced the Ford Motor Company this year as the single largest industrial R&D performer (see right-hand graph). The change reflects the drug industry's determination to search even harder for new blockbuster drugs, industry observers say. Even in the pharmaceutical sector, EU companies lagged behind their counterparts in the rest of the world. They had an R&D intensity ? the ratio of investment to net sales ? of 12%, compared with 15% elsewhere.  \n                Obstacle course \n              ?The big difference between the pharmaceutical and other sectors is that we have to reinvent ourselves every 10?15 years,? says John Patterson, head of drug development for AstraZeneca in Macclesfield, UK. He points to the industry's challenges from patent expirations and the rising cost of clinical trials as a result of stricter demands from regulatory bodies. Patterson predicts that the drug industry's position as the top R&D investor will now be consolidated. With around 75% of its main medicines due to go off patent by 2013, the pharmaceutical industry is already spending upwards of US$60 billion a year and not coming up with enough new products, he says. Patterson's own estimate is that the global industry now spends 16% of sales on R&D ? and he reckons this could hit 20% before long. ?Either we get more productive or we'll have to spend more,? he says. The scoreboard exercise is part of an EU strategy ? first outlined in 2000 and formally enshrined at a meeting of member states' leaders in Barcelona in 2002 ? to try to increase R&D in the European Union from just under 2% at that time to 3% of gross domestic product by 2010. Although this year's scoreboard suggests that some progress has been made, hitting that target now seems to be ?practically impossible?, says Hern\u00e1ndez. But the target still serves a purpose, he contends. ?The emphasis of this policy is to raise awareness regarding the importance of boosting research efforts, especially in the private sector.? The scoreboard is compiled with methodology developed at the UK Department of Trade and Industry for its national R&D survey, which has been published annually from 1992. The method limits inclusion to companies with audited accounts that are publicly available, and has received few complaints, Hern\u00e1ndez says. The survey includes only companies that itemize R&D expenditure in their financial reports. It also assigns firms to the country of their registered headquarters ? even if their R&D operations are located elsewhere. And fluctuations in foreign exchange rates greatly affect companies' relative positions in the rankings. In the case of the depreciation of the US dollar against the euro, for example, the scoreboard underestimates the R&D growth rate of EU companies that have operations in the United States, and overestimates the growth rate of US companies that also operate in the European Union. And as the scoreboard's authors acknowledge, reporting practices and definitions of R&D vary widely between companies and countries.  \n                Missing links \n              Specialists also question whether absolute rises in R&D investment actually correlate with competitiveness or innovation. Some argue that the relation between research budgets and financial outcomes is too complicated to be captured accurately in a ranking system such as the scoreboard. ?It's not the quantity, but the quality of R&D that is most important,? says Nick Von Tunzelmann of the science policy research unit at the University of Sussex, UK. He admits that such things are hard to measure, but says: ?More could be done on the quality side of the scoreboard. The authors could look at how much bang the companies get for their buck.? Von Tunzelmann highlights several factors that make it difficult to draw broad conclusions from the scoreboard. Eastern Asia and the United States tend to dominate the most research-intensive industries, such as information technology, whereas European countries have traditionally been stronger in 'medium-tech' sectors such as automotive production and bulk chemicals. And although the missing of the 3% target may come as no surprise, the stubborn fact that only 55% of EU R&D was last year undertaken by the private sector ? well short of the the two-thirds that the European Union had targeted for 2010 ? is an even bigger problem, Von Tunzelmann says. Meanwhile, Von Tunzelmann contends that the role of R&D is changing from an end in itself to a way to develop the capacity to undertake change. Ultimately, he says, companies need to be able to put R&D in its proper context. ?R&D is only a part of the whole innovation effort,? von Tunzelmann adds. ?On the other hand, it is a fairly strategic part of the whole picture?. \n                     The European Commission Industrial Research and Innovaton website \n                   \n                     AstraZeneca website \n                   \n                     University of Sussex's Science and Technology Policy Research Unit \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

The Deccan Traps, as they?re called, have been suspected before of having some sort of global impact around the end of the Cretaceous period and the beginning of the Tertiary, known as the K?T boundary. Earlier research had dated the main outburst of the lava flows as occurring within 800,000 years of the boundary. But the new analysis uses tiny plankton fossils, trapped between lava layers, to date the flow to the boundary itself. ?This is the first time we can link the main phase of the Deccan Traps to the mass extinction,? says team leader Gerta Keller, a palaeontologist at Princeton University in New Jersey. Keller and Thierry Adatte of the University of Neuch\u00a3tel in Switzerland presented their research on 30 October in Denver, Colorado, at the annual meeting of the Geological Society of America. Earlier work indicated that Deccan-like eruptions would have resulted in huge amounts of sulphur dioxide quickly building up in the atmosphere. And new work in press, from Vincent Courtillot of the Institut de Physique du Globe in Paris and his colleagues, suggests that the Deccan flows released some 50?100 gigatonnes of sulphur dioxide and carbon dioxide ? about 10 times more than estimated from the meteorite strike, at Chicxulub on Mexico?s Yucat\u00a3n Peninsula.  But scientists who have worked on the impact theory were quick to question the new analysis. The amount of gas spewed out by the Deccan flows would have been insufficient to cause the extinctions, says Philippe Claeys of the Free University in Brussels, Belgium. ?It is not possible,? he says. Jan Smit, of the Free University in Amsterdam, adds that he thinks that when the meteorite hit, it would have put out more gas in vaporizing rock than the entire Deccan flow. ?I don?t believe they have said anything new here,? he says. Keller has long challenged the Chicxulub theory. Several years ago, her team reported that analysis of a core drilled into the Chixculub crater suggested that the impact dated to 300,000 years earlier than the K-T boundary. Later work, from a core drilled along the Brazos River in Texas, also seemed to support this notion of a 300,000-year gap.  But the work is not clear-cut. Another report presented at the Denver meeting this week suggested that the sediments in the Brazos core had been reworked by geological forces over time, thus confusing the dating of what happened when. In their Indian studies, the team focused on an area around Rajahmundry, on the Bay of Bengal. In the Krishna-Godavari basin there, they examined four quarry outcrops that have lava layers below them and that sit on top of a 9-metre-thick layer of marine sediments. \"The key to our success was finding marine sediments with microfossils,\" says Keller. Within those, she reported finding tiny fossils of ocean creatures, known as foraminifera, that exploded in a massive bloom after the mass extinction.  Minerals in the sediments also suggested that the climate was more humid after the gas eruption, Adatte says. \"This shows how significant the lava flows were,\" he says. Next year, the team hopes to drill a new core at Rajahmundry to date the sediments more precisely, and to understand exactly how the gases affected the growth of plankton. An Indian oil company also has cores taken from the area, which Keller hopes to examine. \n                   Gerta Keller's home page \n                 \n                   Chicxulub core home page \n                 Reprints and Permissions"},

It's not often that research results look this good. An elegant new way to visualize individual brain cells not only provides a major boost to scientists trying to understand how the brain works, but has also won one of its developers a major prize in science photography.  The method ? described by neuroscientists at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, in today?s  Nature  ? allows researchers to see more clearly how individual neurons connect with each other by colouring each one from a palette of about 90 shades. In this way they will be able to build up a detailed diagram of the brain's wiring, which will help to study how it computes.  More than a century ago, neuroscientists developed the first method of staining individual neurons ? with silver chromate. Work with this technique was the basis of the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1906. But this could only stain neurons with one colour. Only in the last decade have scientists improved on this technique, using genetic engineering to transfer genes for fluorescent proteins into mice such that they are expressed in neurons. But until now they could transfer no more than two florescent-protein genes at a time, lighting up the brain with two colours. ?It was clear that two colours were not enough to map connections efficiently in the brain?s complex tangle of neurons,? says Joshua Sanes, one of the paper?s senior scientists.  \n              All the colours of the rainbow \n           Jeff Lichtman, Sanes and colleagues found a way for transgenic mice to express various mixtures of four colours of fluorescent proteins in their neurons: yellow, red, cyan, and either orange or green.  They did this by introducing a string of four colour-producing genes, controlled by a genetic system called Cre/  lox.  They organized the elements of this system such that it would randomly promote the activity of just one of the colour-producing genes  in vivo.  Then they introduced multiple copies of the gene string into the genome of mouse embryonic stem cells, from which they developed transgenic mice. Each neuron of the transgenic mice switched on a random number of these colour genes. The result was some 90 shades that could be seen by a researcher looking at the cells. One neuron, for example, might switch on just red and cyan, so it would glow a pleasant mauve; a neighbour might switch on a lot of red and a bit of green and blue glow a shocking pink. They call their system the Brainbow. This colour mixing is similar to that used by television sets, says Sanes, which produce only red, green or blue pixels but mix them to make any colour needed.  \n              You light up my brain \n            Brain researchers say that they are amazed that the Harvard scientists managed to pull off such a technically difficult stunt while making it so easy to use in practice. The transgenic mice and necessary research tools are now available for other scientists to use.  \"It will give those of us trying to work out how the brain computes different insights,\" says Karel Svoboda, a neuroscientist at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute?s Janelia Farm laboratories, in Loudoun County, Virginia. ?Brainbow will allow you to trace neuronal circuits over long distances ? maybe across centimetres of tissue,\" says Svoboda. \"You can see how different neuronal circuits relate to each other in the same animal.\" It?s also \"very aesthetic\", he says. Which is why Jean Livet ? the postdoc credited with having the idea for the Cre/  lox  tricks, and the paper?s first author ? has just won the 2007 Olympus BioScapes Digital Imaging competition, says Sanes. \n                   Podcast \n                 Reprints and Permissions"},

It?s not hot air: balloon astronomy is rising. Earlier this month, a giant 100-metre-wide balloon soared into the skies above New Mexico, carrying a 2,500 kilogram gondola of scientific instruments. The successful flight was a first test for the Sunrise mission, which aims to take the best pictures yet captured of the Sun. Those snaps will be used to help understand the chaotic solar magnetic field, which can trigger stormy 'space weather' that sometimes wreaks havoc on satellites. The scientists involved say that they hope the mission's success will herald a new enthusiasm for cheap but high-flying astronomical balloons, which have been overlooked by space agencies in past decades. Sunrise?s first science flight is planned for June 2009, when a balloon, carrying a one-metre telescope, will launch from Sweden and float to a height of 37 kilometres. Stratospheric winds will usher it along a two-week, sun-drenched route around the Arctic Circle. The telescope, mounted with steadying equipment to remove jitters from the camera work, should be able to take pictures of features on the Sun's surface as small as 30 kilometres across. That's four times better than the best solar telescope in space, and twice as good as the best on Earth, says Michael Kn\u00a3lker, director of the High Altitude Observatory at the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) in Boulder, Colorado. NCAR is running the project along with NASA and several European partners. Kn\u00a3lker is particularly interested in studying faculae: intensely magnetic bright spots on the Sun's surface whose swirling motions highlight the Sun?s turbulent magnetic field. In times of increased activity, streams of magnetized plasma can shoot from these faculae towards Earth, causing stormy space weather. ?It can induce rather strong [electric] currents in satellites, that have led, in various instances, to satellites being fried,? he says.  \n              This is a test \n            The test flight, which took place on 3 October at the Columbia Scientific Balloon Facility in Fort Sumner, New Mexico, was a success, says test-flight project manager David Elmore.  Engineers only partly filled the plastic balloon with helium, since the gas expands in the rarified air of the stratosphere. The 20-micrometre-thick balloon, thinner than human hair but as heavy as the gondola itself, rose at a speed of 18 kilometres an hour. After shedding some 100 kilograms of ballast, the balloon settled in calm 12 knot winds at an altitude of 37 kilometres. The cold affected the electronics more than expected, Elmore says. At -70\u00a3C, several electronics units failed. Engineers couldn?t get a high-speed telemetry connection to work, and had to direct the balloon with the equivalent speed of a dial-up connection. After 10 hours, small explosive charges cut the gondola from the balloon, allowing the instruments to return to Earth by parachute. The gondola landed in a Texas farmer?s recently harvested wheat field; the balloon, torn by the explosives, landed nearby.  \n              Science on the cheap \n            Kn\u00a3lker says the overall cost of the mission will be less than US$100 million, with the bulk of that paying for the telescope. An equivalent space mission would cost 10 times as much, he estimates. Jonathan Grindlay, an astronomer at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, says that balloon missions can cost even less ? perhaps 5% of a satellite mission ? and still do good science. Boomerang, a balloon released over the Antarctica in 1998, mapped the cosmic microwave background radiation and hinted that the Universe was 'flat' long before NASA's arguably more famous ? and more expensive ? 2001 Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe mission (see  Ringing in the new cosmology ).  Of course, there are disadvantages to balloons. Satellites can stay aloft collecting data for years, whereas high-altitude balloons rarely last more than a month. Eventually they leak, and come down.  But balloons such as the one involved in the Sunrise project sometimes don?t get the respect they deserve, Grindlay says. ?There?s been the feeling that balloons are a second class way of doing space experiments,? he says. But Grindlay, who sits on a committee that NASA reconstituted in August to plan the next 5 to 10 years of balloon science, says NASA officials have recently \"taken a much more enlightened view of balloon payloads\".

Climate models might be improving but they will never be able to tell us exactly what to expect. That's the conclusion of experts from the University of Washington, Seattle, who have set out to prove that predicting the exact level of climate change is by its very nature an uncertain science.  Over the past 30 years, climate models have not appreciably narrowed down the precise relationship between greenhouse gases and the planet's temperature ? despite huge advances in computing power, climate observations and the number of scientists studying the problem, say Gerard Roe and Marcia Baker. The researchers now argue that this is because the uncertainty simply cannot be reduced. They and other climatologists are now calling on policy-makers to make decisive policies on avoiding dangerous climate change, even if we don't have perfect models. This means focusing on keeping the planet's temperature below a certain point (and being willing and able to adjust emissions targets to achieve that), rather than trying to work out far in advance the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere that will produce that level of warming.  \n              Sensitive subject \n            Most models predict that the world's 'climate sensitivity' ? the increase in global mean surface temperature expected to result from a doubling of atmospheric carbon dioxide relative to preindustrial levels ? is probably somewhere between 2 \u00a3C and 4.5 \u00a3C.  But this is what climate models are generally good at: describing the most probable, modest temperature responses. Working out the possible extreme responses ? which are less likely ? is much more difficult, Roe and Baker point out. The graph of potential temperature responses to rising greenhouse-gas levels shows a cluster of probable outcomes at the bottom of the scale, but a 'long tail' of possible extreme outcomes.  Roe and Baker's analysis, described in this week's  Science , shows mathematically that this tail is unlikely to get any smaller, regardless of how much research is done. This comes down to the fact that, if extreme events are set in motion, the outcome is necessarily difficult to predict from today's data. Put simply, if average temperatures rise by 4 \u00a3C, the world will be so different from today's conditions that it will be hard to work out what might happen next. \"We have to accept that that's the fundamental nature of the beast,\" says Roe. As a result, he adds, \"it's very hard to distinguish between [the probability of] 6 \u00a3C warming and 10 \u00a3C warming.\"  \n              Off target \n            Politicians are therefore missing the point in attempting to draft policy targets based on a specific level of greenhouse gases in our skies, says Myles Allen, a climatologist at the University of Oxford, UK. \"That's a daft policy,\" he says. Many climate analysts point to an overall greenhouse-gas concentration equivalent to 450 parts per million of carbon dioxide as the limit at which levels should be stabilized. This is widely predicted to avoid the 2 \u00a3C warming thought to be the general threshold for dangerous climate effects. But again, that figure is very uncertain. Allen says that politicians should focus on the temperature target, and adjust emissions targets accordingly as time passes, rather than committing to a firm emissions target now. \"We need an explicit commitment to do what it takes to avoid 2 \u00a3C of warming,\" Allen argues. \"You don't need to know the climate sensitivity to avoid dangerous climate change,\" he adds. \n                   Nature Reports Climate Change  \n                 \n                   Climate change  \n                 \n                   Global warming  \n                 \n                   Avoiding Dangerous Climate Change  \n                 \n                   Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change  \n                 \n                   Oxford University Centre for the Environment  \n                 Reprints and Permissions"},

Neuroscientists have pinpointed the areas of the brain that help us to look on the bright side.  People have a propensity to be optimistic, expecting to live longer and be healthier than the population average. Knowing which regions of the brain are affected should help us understand this tendency. It could also assist in unpicking the mechanisms of depression, which is related to pessimism and affects the same network of brain regions. Elizabeth Phelps and her colleagues from New York University ran into this so-called ?optimism bias? when they set out to investigate what happens when people imagine emotional events in the past and future.  They had volunteers think about events such as winning an award, or the end of a romantic relationship, and at the same time they scanned their brains using functional magnetic resonance imaging.  But the researchers hit on a problem. The volunteers were not good at imagining bad things happening to them. They would even turn relatively neutral events, such as getting a haircut, into positive things. ?It was very hard to get people to imagine negative events in the future,? says Phelps. So the team changed their focus: they decided to look at the brain areas involved in the optimism bias instead.  \n              Imagine that \n            The group asked people to imagine positive and negative events that had either happened in the past or might happen in the future. Then, the volunteers rated their levels of optimism (as a general personality trait) using a standard psychological test.  Imagining positive events in the future was accompanied by activity in two areas of the brain that usually regulate how emotion affects memory and decisions: the amygdala, buried deep within the brain, and the front portion of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), which sits just behind the eyes. Conversely, activation in both these areas dropped below average when the volunteers thought about future negative events.  The more optimistic people considered themselves to be, the greater the activity in the ACC. The results are published in  Nature . That the ACC is involved makes sense to Phelps, since it fits with previous research. ?When you?re in a positive mindset you?ll see more activity in this region,\" she notes. More generally, Phelps suggests, the ACC could be acting as a central hub for signals from other parts of the brain that feed into how we feel about events. \"We think this is a general regulatory region that may be mediating this tendency we have to think about things optimistically.?  \n              High emotion \n            The study meshes nicely with other work on the brain networks that deal with remembering the past and imagining the future. Dan Schacter?s group at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, have been studying these processes as people recall non-emotional events, and has found very similar regions at work. ?This is a nice complement to the kind of stuff we?ve been doing,? he says.  ?The interesting link here is with the ACC ? that?s a region where depressed patients show a decrease in activity,? he says. People with depression are more pessimistic and find it hard to imagine future events in a positive light. Phelps agrees that these results might provide insight into the mechanisms that underlie depression. But how that might affect future treatments is unclear. \n                   Brain and behaviour news \n                 \n                   Elizabeth Phelps' homepage \n                 \n                   Dan Schacter's homepage \n                 Reprints and Permissions"},

An analysis of 50,000-year-old Neanderthal DNA suggests that at least some of the ancient hominids probably had pale skin and red hair.  The findings, published this week in  Science 1 , are based on the sequence of a single gene, called  mc1r . Humans with a less functional form of the MC1R protein are more likely to be fair skinned ? an adaptation that may have helped inhabitants of high latitudes synthesize vitamin D more efficiently in limited sunlight. Analyses of Neanderthal DNA are always subject to the problem of fossil samples being contaminated with modern human DNA in the lab or the field. But Carles Lalueza-Fox of the University of Barcelona, Spain, with Holger R\u00a3mpler of the University of Leipzig in Germany and colleagues, found that the  mc1r  gene in two European Neanderthal fossils they studied contained a single base-pair change that seems to be unique to Neanderthals.  ?We were lucky we found a variant that had not been described in modern humans,? says co-author Michael Hofreiter of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany. ?That made it unlikely to be human contamination.? The researchers re-sequenced the applicable region of the gene multiple times, then asked two additional labs to repeat the experiments using fresh extracts. They also sequenced fragments of the  mc1r  gene from the researchers in each lab, as well as the archaeologists and palaeontologists who had handled the fossils. And they searched databases containing  mc1r  sequence from 2,800 humans and tested several hundred additional samples.  In the end, they had surveyed more than 3,700 humans, and none contained the Neanderthal sequence. ?If it is in the modern human population, it?s at an extremely low frequency,? says Hofreiter.  \n              Fair test \n            The researchers inserted the Neanderthal  mc1r  gene into human cells grown in the lab, and found that it had roughly the same low functionality as seen in  mc1r  genes from fair-skinned people with red hair. It?s impossible to determine the precise frequency of pallid, red-haired Neanderthals that once populated Europe. But the researchers estimate that at least 1% of the population would have carried two copies of this less-active gene, giving them roughly the same pigmentation seen in modern red-heads. Scientists have estimated that there should be at least a million nucleotides (single letters in the genome) that differ between humans and Neanderthals, says Lalueza-Fox. But little research has been done as yet to identify these. Recent work shows that Neanderthals have the same version of a speech gene as modern humans (see  Modern speech gene found in Neanderthals ). ?This is the first functional difference in the genome between Neanderthals and modern humans,? says Lalueza-Fox.  \n              Independent evolution \n            Lalueza-Fox and Hofreiter note that the absence of the Neanderthal-specific  mc1r  sequence in modern humans suggests that pale skin evolved independently in Neanderthals and humans, rather than from interbreeding between the two.  That's interesting but not entirely unexpected, says Rachel Caspari, an anthropologist at Central Michigan University in Mount Pleasant. The regulation of skin colour in humans is very complex, she notes; so she would expect evolution to have come up with many different ways to generate lighter skin.  Caspari cautions against ruling out genetic exchange between the two populations just yet. It is still possible that the allele was present in humans 50,000 years ago, but was later replaced by a different mutation, she says. ?It certainly doesn?t support gene flow between Neanderthals and humans,? says Caspari, ?but it doesn?t refute the idea either.? \n                   Neanderthal DNA web focus  \n                 \n                   Max Planck Department of Evolutionary Genetics  \n                 \n                   Science \n                 Reprints and Permissions"},

Children delivered by caesarian section are 20% more likely to develop asthma, concludes a new review of previous research. This may help to explain the skyrocketing incidence of asthma in recent decades, the researchers suggest. It has been shown before that babies born naturally are exposed to maternal vaginal and intestinal bacteria that babies delivered by c-section are not. This may create an early-life exercise for the immune system, helping infants to recognize and fight pathogens. The 'hygiene hypothesis' argues that a lack of exposure to such pathogens can be bad for the immune system. In the absence of such exposure, immune systems become sensitized to harmless materials ? for example, dust or pollen ? resulting in conditions such as allergies and asthma. \"Too hygienic a birth without a welcome dose of mother's microbes might give rise to a hypersensitive future in a genetically susceptible baby,\" explains allergist Maria Pesonen of the Helsinki Skin and Allergy Hospital in Finland. On the back of these ideas, many researchers have tested a possible link between c-sections and asthma. But the studies have generally been small, making it hard to detect changes in asthma risk, and they came to a variety of conclusions: some supported the theory and others did not.  \n              All together \n            So Suren Thavagnanam at the Royal Belfast Hospital for Sick Children in Northern Ireland and his colleagues conducted a meta-analysis of the results from 22 previous studies on the subject, to see whether they could get a firmer answer from more data. ?The data were highly conflicting, we didn?t know what to expect,? says co-author Mike Shields, a respiratory paediatrician at Queen?s University Belfast. Their work reveals a 20% increase in asthma risk in children delivered by c-section, they report in  Clinical and Experimental Allergy 1 .  \"That's an eyebrow-raising figure,\" says Pesonen. She notes that meta-analyses can give misleading results if the studies they are comparing have different methodologies, so \"it may be that the 20% is an overestimate\". Variation in breast-feeding and baby birthweight may contribute to the difference, for example. However, she adds that the result seems \"plausible\".  \n              On the up \n            The recent increase in c-sections in the United Kingdom may be partly to blame for rising asthma levels, the researchers argue. The incidence of asthma in UK children is now more than four times higher than it was in 1973.  Many theories have been proposed for why this is. It could be that an increase in diagnosis has contributed to the surge. Or a decrease in parasites and diseases may be causing immune systems to develop inappropriately. Others argue that changes in breast-feeding duration or the chemicals used in manufacturing are somehow responsible.  \"The next step is monitoring asthma prevalence in Northern Ireland, now that the government is trying to reduce the number of inappropriate c-sections,\" says Shields. ?As c-sections become less common, so too should asthma.\" Pesonen also wonders whether researchers should try exposing newborns to useful bacteria. ?Perhaps we should consider counterbalancing the lack of bacterial exposure in c-section newborns by using probiotics,\" she says. \n                   National Heart Lung and Blood Institute: What is Asthma?  \n                 \n                   NIH Allergy Information on Medline \n                 Reprints and Permissions"},

The comet is now easy to spot; it looks to the naked eye like a fuzzy yellow star.  Brian Marsden, a comet-spotter and expert on 17P Holmes at the Minor Planet Center at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, says that he has received at least two mistaken reports of a new star since the comet brightened.  \n              Starburst \n            All comets change in brightness as they get closer to the Sun.

This wake gets larger as a frozen comet approaches the heat of the Sun, reflecting more light and releasing glowing, ionized gas. The reason that comet 17P Holmes brightened so suddenly isn?t yet known; this comet doesn't have a tail. It could be because heat from the Sun infiltrated a tiny crack in the comet?s icy core, causing it to melt and crack open abruptly, spewing out lots of dust and gas that are now reflecting more sunlight.

A 4-year-old Abyssinian named Cinnamon has become the first cat to have its genome decoded. She joins a menagerie that now includes dogs, mice, rats and chimps. Dozens more animals wait in the genome queue ? from armadillos to wallabies. The sequence is a rough version that includes just 60% of Cinnamon?s total allotment of DNA 'letters' (As, Cs, Ts and Gs) with many holes in between. But the 'light' treatment, which was done for $10 million, is good enough for some types of studies, the researchers say. The strategy should serve as a model for how to sequence the genomes of other animals that lack a large research community to push for a fuller and costlier genome, says Stephen O?Brien, a geneticist at the National Cancer Institute (NCI) in Frederick, Maryland, who spearheaded the project. ?This is kind of a how-to map of what to do when you sequence an aardvark,? he says. The sequence should speed up the discovery of genes linked to cat traits and diseases. Earlier this year, with the help of the sequence, O?Brien?s team found a mutation that has left Cinnamon blind since she was a kitten. It causes a condition, common in Abyssinian cats, called retinitis pigmentosa.  \n              Puzzle pieces \n            When mapping a genome, researchers shred the long stretch of billions of base pairs (or DNA letters) into shorter segments that are decoded by machines. But it's easy to miss some sections of a genome this way. To make sure the whole genome gets covered, scientists sequence enough stretches of DNA to add up to many times the total length of a genome. The more such sequencing is done, the fewer letters scientists are likely to miss. With Cinnamon, O?Brien?s team sequenced about 5 billion base pairs ? 1.9 times the length of her 2.7 billion base-pair genome. For comparison, the human genome was sequenced seven times over, and the dog?s seven and a half times. The problem then is putting all the millions of sequenced pieces back together, and in order. This can be done by looking at the overlap between sequenced pieces. But the sparse coverage seen in the cat makes it hard to reassemble.  As a shortcut, O?Brien and NCI bioinformaticist Joan Pontius lined up short stretches of cat DNA against similar sections of the dog and human genomes. That gave them a quicker and better way to fit the DNA together, they report online today in  Genome Research .  \n              Picture imperfect \n            The result wasn?t a perfect sequence, but it is better than would be expected from such limited sequencing, says O?Brien. ?There are going to be some mistakes in there, but probably less than 1% of the time we'll be wrong,? he says. The team identified more than 20,000 genes and mapped 327,000 single letter differences that occur between cats. Researchers can freely access the information on a website called  Garfield  . The sequence will be useful; cats are used as a model to study conditions such as blindness and HIV. \"Just yesterday, I pulled a gene off it,\" says Kathryn Meurs, a veterinarian at Washington State University in Pullman, who studies genes linked to cardiomyopathy, a heart disease that affects cats and humans. A month ago, she says, she would have had to do several weeks of lab work to find a cat equivalent of a human gene of interest ? and there was no guarantee that she would find it.  \n              Menagerie \n            In 2005, the US National Institutes of Health announced plans to sequence 26 mammals, including alpacas, elephants and dolphins, with the same sort of coverage as the cat.  Those plans are advancing. But others argue that as the price of sequencing comes down, there's no point in only doing a light sequencing. ?It?s a little bit like reading a book where you only get to read half of every sentence,? says Steven Salzberg, a computational biologist at the University of Maryland in College Park. Salzberg supports releasing early drafts of sequences, so long as researchers continue to work towards a better version. He?ll get his wish with Cinnamon?s DNA: a more complete sequence ? even better than the dog?s ? is due early next year. \n                   The Cat Genome Project \n                 \n                   Other Genomes \n                 \n                   Garfield Cat Genome Browser \n                 Reprints and Permissions"},

Cholesterol-reducing medication might make radiotherapy more effective at treating prostate cancer, according to a preliminary look at patient data. Prostate cancer affects the male reproductive system and is one of the most commonly diagnosed cancers in men. Depending on the aggressiveness of the disease, it can be ?cured? through surgery, in which the tumours are literally cut out, or with radiotherapy. Radiotherapy creates free radicals that damage DNA and stop tumorous cells from growing. But sometimes the cancers spread to other parts of the body or partially resist radiation and grow back later. So researchers are keen to tackle the cancer in as many ways as possible.  Research in animals has hinted that cholesterol-reducing medication may help to slow cancer growth. And in 2006, Cancer Research UK called for more research into the effect, after a study showed a link between high cholesterol and risk of prostate cancer risk.  To investigate, Michael Zelefsky from the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York retrospectively studied men who had been treated with radiotherapy for prostate cancer and monitored for an average of 85 months afterwards. Of the 871 men in the study, 168 happened to also be on drugs called statins, which are used to lower cholesterol, while undergoing treatment. Zelefsky reports today at the American Society for Therapeutic Radiation Oncology meeting in Los Angeles, California, that taking these drugs while receiving high-dose radiotherapy resulted, on average, in a 10% improvement in the long-term cure rates. He adds that the greatest benefits were in patients with the most aggressive cancers.  ?This is encouraging, but randomized trials need to be done to be sure there really is something to this,? says Zelefsky.  ?If a repeat study confirms that statins, which are effectively non-toxic, can really be used to improve curing methods by 10% then this would be practice changing. I would want to see all of my patients on this,? says Christopher Rose of Valley Radiotherapy Associates in Burbank, California.  \n              Kink in the shield \n            What the statins are actually doing to damage cancer cells, or whether they might help with other cancers, remains unclear.  Zelefsky suspects that the medication is somehow making the malignant cells more vulnerable to the radiation, effectively functioning as a radio-sensitizer. Reducing levels of cholesterol in the body might weaken the membrane ?shield? that surrounds and protects all cells, he says. These shields are in themselves partly made of cholestorol. Weakening this could help the free radicals produced by radiation to damage the target cancer cells more effectively, Zelefsky suggests. Zelefsky explains that statins are also thought to have cancer-preventative effects: they seem to protect against colorectal and prostate cancer. This, when combined with the the radio-sensitization, could have multiple anti-cancer effects.  It wouldn?t be the first time that two treatments have been seen to work best in conjunction. Hormone therapy to reduce testosterone levels also works extremely well with radiation. ?We may see statin medication synergise with radiation just as effectively as hormones did,? says Zelefsky. \n                   National Cancer Institute \n                 \n                   American Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology  \n                 Reprints and Permissions"},

An explosive chemical technique can now be used to identify individual molecules in biological samples, down to the single-cell level. Researchers hope the procedure could be used in clinics a few years from now to screen blood or urine for metabolites ? the final products of biological processes ? that can be used to diagnose disease. \"The vast majority of small molecules in humans are unknown,\" says Gary Siuzdak at the Scripps Center for Mass Spectrometry, La Jolla, California. \"People don't appreciate this.\" But his technique could change that: \"The potential for diagnosing and understanding disease is really wonderful,\" he says. The mass-spectrometry technique developed by Siuzdak and colleagues, known as nanostructure-initiator mass spectrometry (NIMS), is reported in  Nature 1  this week. The process relies on a slab of silicon etched with nanometre-sized holes filled with 'initiator' molecules. The sample sits on top of this layer. The uneven surface is then hit with an ionising beam, or a laser, at which point the molecules trapped in the nanoholes heat up until they explode outwards into the sample. This pushes molecules off the sample surface as gaseous ions, which can be detected and identified by the mass spectrometer.  \n              Strong but gentle \n            The technique offers a number of advantages over others, Siuzdak says. Although the exploding initiator molecules are \"pretty forceful\", in some ways they are relatively gentle: because the sample is ionised by exploding particles ? rather than being directly hit with an ion beam or a laser ? surface molecules are released whole rather than being shattered into fragments.  And because the sample doesn't need to be mixed with anything, it is easier to identify the molecules coming from it. Metabolites can be tricky to detect using techniques where the sample is dissolved and mixed with a matrix material before it can be analysed, since the metabolites often look similar to the matrix. Matrix-based systems also don't let the user work out exactly where in a sample a certain molecule has come from. NIMS does. This is a real advantage, says Renato Zenobi, a mass spectrometry expert at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich. ?In any imaging technique, spatial resolution is important,? he says. For example, with NIMS you could potentially tell whether a drug being tested in an animal made it into the intended cell, or if it got stuck in the cell walls.  Siuzdak has used NIMS to detect the metabolites present in a single cancer cell. The spatial resolution of the technique meant that he was able to distinguish cancerous and normal cells in his sample, he says. The full applications of the technique have not yet been fleshed out. But Siuzdak?s team is dedicated to seeing what it can do: even to the extent of testing it on themselves. ?I walked into the lab one day and literally saw [my postdoc] with a needle in his hand,? says Siuzdak. \n                   Nature's chemistry portal \n                 \n                   Scripps Center for Mass Spectrometry  \n                 Reprints and Permissions"},

On top of a hill near the south pole of the Moon is a sunny spot that might make the ideal place for a lunar outpost, according to preliminary analysis of data from the European Space Agency (ESA) satellite SMART-1. Ben Bussey, from the Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Maryland, and colleagues found the spot by looking at images from ESA?s SMART-1 mission, which orbited the Moon for a year and a half before crash-landing there in September 2006. The Advanced Moon micro-Imager Experiment (AMIE) took shots of the Moon's surface throughout SMART-1's mission. After close analysis, the group found a hill on a ridge to the southwest of Shackleton crater at the south pole, that he says is constantly illuminated during the lunar southern summer. In each summer 'day', as the Moon turns once on its axis with respect to the Sun and orbits the Earth once (that takes just more than 27 Earth days), the hilltop stays firmly in sunshine, Bussey told the International Lunar Exploration Working Group International Conference on Exploration and Utilisation of the Moon in Sorrento, Italy, on 23 October.  ?I think this is the most illuminated place near the south pole, and potentially the most illuminated place on the Moon,? Bussey says. The hill makes a great candidate for any future lunar base. ?A lunar outpost on this hill would have constant solar energy during the summer,? explains Bussey. Coupled to that, it?s near to both a region that is known to be in the dark constantly, and to a source of water ice ? a useful resource and place of interest for scientists looking for evidence of meteorite impacts and volatile molecules.  \n              Land of the midnight sun \n            On Earth, the 23\u00a3 tilt of our axis to the Sun ensures that a large area gets all-day sunlight in the southern summer. On the Moon this angle is only 1.5\u00a3, resulting in a smaller area that might experience constant summer light. But it was previously unknown whether mountains, hills or dips in this area might throw shadows that block the sunshine at certain times of day. Alternatively a large hill might peak out of the shadows all year round, to catch a bit of winter light too. Bussey's hill is the best bet for this so far. Bussey and his colleagues haven't yet analysed AMIE pictures from the southern winter, but he is working on these data now. Identifying the hill of interest in the array of photos is a time-consuming process, he says.  A 1999 study using data from NASA?s moon-mapping mission Clementine also took photos of this hill, but in low resolution. Snaps from that mission hint that the hill doesn't catch the winter sunlight. But the improvement in resolution with the AMIE data means it is now possible for engineers to look more closely at the topography, and work out where and how to best position solar panels to get the maximum power. For human habitation, a spot that is lit permanently, all year, would be the ideal. Bussey does not think this is likely anywhere on the Moon. ?I think everywhere, unfortunately, gets dark,? he says. \n                   News feature: Space exploration; where 24 men have gone before \n                 \n                   9th ILEWG International Conference on Exploration and Utilisation of the Moon  \n                 \n                   SMART-1 \n                 Reprints and Permissions"},

The games have been held for three years running, in an attempt to encourage development of the technologies needed to build an elevator into space. The games include a competition to build a strong rope or 'tether', of the sort that would link such a machine to Earth, and creating a ground-powered robot that can climb a rope at speed. Organizers were initially impressed by this year's entrants (see  Space elevators: going up? ). But they weren't good enough to meet the games' criteria. The fastest climber was, for the third year in a row, from the Space Design Team at the University of Saskatchewan in Canada. The team's laser-powered climber whizzed up a ribbon more than 100 metres long in 54 seconds, but this was not fast enough to reach the 2 metres per second target needed to walk away with the money. The climbing competition was hindered by bad weather, which delayed the games, and the fact that the ribbon the climbers were meant to climb kept snapping. No one knows why this happened: perhaps the weather or twisting strain put on it by the climbers were to blame, or maybe it was simply faulty.

WASHINGTON DC Freezing a woman's eggs for use later in fertility treatments doesn't seem to greatly increase birth defects or abnormalities, new data suggest. But the findings, presented at the annual meeting of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM) in Washington DC last week, are difficult to interpret. The field remains caught between researchers, most of whom say that the practice should still be considered experimental, and the public, which is itching to embrace the technology to extend a woman's fertile years. Egg freezing is regarded as a positive, if costly, option for women facing illness or treatment that could truncate their fertility. But most researchers think that the procedure is not appropriate for women who wish to delay fertility for social, career or other non-health-related reasons. ?We acknowledge the interest women have in this technology,? says Marc Fritz, a professor of obstetrics and gynaecology at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. But ?there remain very few studies in which the safety and efficacy of this practice can be judged.? Last week, an ASRM committee chaired by Fritz recommended that egg freezing continue to be considered experimental, and not be marketed or promoted to healthy young women. Human eggs are large, fragile and filled with water, and both freezing and thawing can damage them. Freezing fertilized embryos is easier and more routine, but is less desirable for some women owing to social or ethical reasons. Some women wish to preserve eggs for the right partner, and couples can be uncomfortable with the prospect of freezing embryos. Egg freezing, which has been in place for at least two decades, has not been used widely; doctors estimate that between 300 and 600 children have been born from formerly frozen eggs. Safety remains one of the main concerns. At the ASRM meeting, Andrea Borini of the Centre for Reproductive Health in Bologna, Italy, reported that just 2 of 123 live births from his clinic's egg cryopreservation programme had major abnormalities: one had a nasal blockage, the other a rare developmental disorder called Rubinstein?Taybi Syndrome. (But both children had fathers with fertility problems; ?we may need to look into that,? says Borini.) Meanwhile, Ilan Tur-Kaspa of the Reproductive Genetics Institute in Chicago, Illinois, presented an analysis of more than 37 publications on children born from cryopreserved eggs. Of 555 live births, including those reported by Borini's group, he turned up just 3 other major abnormalities. Demonstrating just how difficult the data are to interpret, Kutluk Oktay from Weill Cornell Medical College in New York says that his group tallies the number of reported births from cryopreserved eggs at closer to 300, not 555. He says that the Tur-Kaspa group missed some overlap in the studies ? places where researchers re-reported earlier findings or where collaborative groups reported on each others' data. But Tur-Kaspa says that they looked closely for these instances, and says that ?as far as we know there's no overlap?. Nevertheless, the data are reassuring, Tur-Kaspa says. Five abnormalities in 550 births is a less than 1% abnormality rate ? comparable to that for a natural pregnancy. The study didn't address efficacy, though. ?We don't know the denominator ? we don't know how many [pregnancies] were terminated,? says Oktay. ?It gives you a summary of how many babies are out there and how many might have an abnormality. But none of the data we've seen out there is sufficient to say the issue is resolved.? One problem in comparing studies is that eggs can be frozen several ways. The method Borini's group uses, known as slow-rate freezing, automatically cools the eggs in stages to subzero temperatures, in the hope that water will be forced out of the egg before it crystallizes. Another process, vitrification, is a flash-freezing process that requires more manual involvement.  \n                Cool tactics \n             Many practitioners think that vitrification is the superior technology, but few prospective studies have been done to compare the procedures. To help change that, Gary Smith, director of the Assisted Reproductive Technologies Laboratory at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, has been collaborating with a group at the Huntington Centre for Reproductive Medicine in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil. At the ASRM meeting, Smith presented results from a small study in which 28 slow-frozen eggs, and 35 vitrified ones, were thawed then fertilized. Further analysis of the results indicates that for every 21 oocytes frozen via vitrification, one pregnancy could be expected. The numbers were slightly worse for slow-rate freezing: 45 frozen eggs per pregnancy. Doubts remain about egg cryopreservation, and every scrap of evidence comes with a dizzying number of caveats because of variability both in procedures and in patients. Still, some doctors are ready to broaden its use. ?We're kind of at a point in this technology where it's kind of like a teeter totter,? says Smith. ?For me the important thing is the completion of studies like this that give the patients information about the reality of these technologies.? \n                     ESHRE: Frozen at five \n                   \n                     American Society for Reproductive Medicine \n                   \n                     Press information on Gary Smith's work \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Fish avoid schooling with animals that have been exposed to very low levels of a common industrial pollutant, new research has found. And this might put the 'smelly' fish at increased risk of predation. The results highlight the need to evaluate the effects of pollutants on fish at sublethal concentrations, researchers say. ?There has been growing interest in the idea that sublethal levels of contaminants can have dramatic fitness consequences on aquatic organisms by affecting their behaviour,? says Bob Wong, a behavioural ecologist at Monash University in Victoria, Australia, who was not affiliated with the study. Fish use chemical cues for everything from mate selection to establishing social hierarchies. Chemical signals can diffuse long distances, and can be more reliable than vision in turbid waters.  Recent work has shown that some pollutants may interfere with that communication. In one case, sewage effluents and agricultural run-offs were shown to interfere with mate selection in the swordtail fish  Xiphophorus birchmanni . Females exposed to polluted water lost the ability to detect cues emitted by males of the same species, and began mating with males of another species.  Now, ecologists Ashley Ward and Suzanne Currie at Mount Allison University in Sackville, Canada, and their collaborators, have tested the effects of a common pollutant, 4-nonylphenol, on another social behaviour: schooling. The compond 4-nonylphenol is a surfactant sometimes found in shampoos and soaps, and is used for sewage treatment and other industrial processes. It also mimics the sex hormone oestrogen, and at high concentrations can be toxic to fish. The researchers looked at how this compond affects banded killifish ( Fundulus diaphanus ), a fish in which chemical signals are used to form large schools of sometimes hundreds of individuals.  \n              A smell to avoid \n            Ward and Currie put some of their killifish, collected from a local lake, in water containing low levels of 4-nonylphenol, then mixed them again with fish swimming in clean water. They found that the clean-water fish avoided those that had been exposed to the chemical. ?Fish don?t like to associate with other fish that smell like nonylphenol,? says Currie.  An effect was seen for exposures of as little as one hour to concentrations as low as 0.5 micrograms per litre of 4-nonylphenol. That's the lower end of concentrations typically seen around sewage outflows, of some 0.5 to 343 micrograms per litre. Concentrations could be higher than this in developing countries, they note. Schooling was not affected in fish that had been treated with oestrogen, suggesting that the effects of 4-nonylphenol were not due to its oestrogen-like properties. The results are published this week in  Proceedings of the Royal Society B . That disruption in schooling behaviour could leave the fish more vulnerable to predators, says Wong. ?Anything that can potentially interfere with social behaviour and social organization is a potential cause for concern because it can directly affect the risk of being eaten.?  The results also highlight a gap in current environmental standards, notes Wong. Limits on pollutants are often set according to the dose at which the compounds become lethal. But schooling in killifish was disrupted at well below that.  ?We?re below, in some cases, the environmentally relevant concentrations,? says Currie. ?If you were going to look at physiological measures of this exposure, you wouldn?t detect anything.? \n                   Insight: Chemical Sensing \n                 \n                   Suzanne Currie \n                 \n                   Bob Wong \n                 \n                   Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences \n                 \n                   Ashley Ward \n                 Reprints and Permissions"},

But can it deliver? Eric Hand investigates. Dennis Gannon, a computer scientist at Indiana University in Bloomington, knows all about bringing huge amounts of computer power to bear on complex scientific problems. He has at his disposal, for the purpose, Big Red, one of the world's largest supercomputers, right there on the campus. But when Jong Youl Choi, a graduate student computer scientist at the university, approached him with a bioinformatics program that he had written, Gannon suggested they run it on Amazon's EC2 Beta program, as translating it for Big Red would be too time-consuming. Last year, the Seattle-based e-commerce firm introduced a 'cloud-computing' option that provides access to an ever-expandable 'cloud' of powerful computer servers. Gannon and Choi set up three virtual computers and uploaded their program, which seeks matches for an unknown protein sequence from a massive national database. The job took about 15 minutes and cost them less than US$2.00. ?It was easy,? Gannon says. ?I don't think Choi even thought about going to Big Red.? Earlier this month, Google and IBM announced their own approach to cloud computing. They say that they will offer free use of a cluster of several hundred servers to the computer-science departments of six top US research universities. The machines will provide researchers with vast amounts of computer power for their data-crunching. Advocates of the concept say that it will fill a middle ground between the computers that most researchers currently have access to, and machines such as Big Red. ?Right now, we have no choice,? says Randal Bryant, dean of computer science at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, ?except from stepping up from desktops to using these giant supercomputers.? IBM and Google say that their pilot scheme will teach computer-science students how to write software that uses the interlinked computers to scour and analyse the large data sets that back up Internet services such as e-mail, maps and social networking. In one exploratory project, for example, students developed software to scan the contents of Wikipedia for entries that might be malicious. ?Students don't have experience dealing with this order of magnitude of data, or the ability to make their computer tasks work in a parallel fashion,? says Dennis Quan, leader of the IBM group responsible for setting up the clusters. The companies hope that the concept will evolve into a valuable resource for researchers who need powerful computers to crunch their data, but don't want the hassle of adapting their applications for supercomputers. They eventually plan to expand the cluster to 1,600 processors. For now, Quan says, the firms have no plans to charge researchers for access to the cloud computers. But their investment, which has been estimated at tens of millions of dollars, may be intended to test the waters and see how badly university scientists crave more computing power. ?They're probably donating this to see if there's a market there,? says Richard Loft, a physicist who works with supercomputers at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colorado. On 16 October, Amazon responded to IBM and Google by expanding its program to more developers, and enhancing the service in terms of speed and storage. Their pay-as-you-go model, unveiled in August 2006, asked researchers to pay small fees of about 15 cents to store a gigabyte of data for a month, or 10 cents and upwards for an hour of processing time. All this activity from the computer business's biggest names reflects the recent explosion in the sheer volume of data that scientists have to deal with. Rapid growth in the precision and speed of sensors and instruments, as well as in the computers themselves, has fired this expansion.  \n                Virtual reality \n              Dealing with the data often falls to supercomputers such as Blue Ice, in Boulder, or Big Red. But critics say that these are more attuned to running huge models of complex systems ? such as Earth's climate, or gas flow in a jet engine ? than they are to the sort of intensive database mining that researchers in many disciplines now want to do. And although the centres that house them do all they can to fight the perception, supercomputers aren't seen as the most user-friendly devices around. The centres still ?favour the efficiency of the machine over the efficiency of the humans that are using the machine?, claims Bryant. He also says that their limitations can make using them ?like the old punch-card days?. Other universities, such as the University of Texas in Austin and the University of Tokyo, have sought to address their scientists' needs by building their own supercomputing clusters. But Google, IBM and Amazon reckon that their experience in high-power applications will make it cheaper and more efficient for them to provide it as a service. If the experience of Gannon and his student is anything to go by, the cloud computer could be the workstation of the future. \n                     Amazon.com cloud compute Web site \n                   \n                     NSF?s TeraGrid Web site \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Atoms can be more overweight than we thought, a team of scientists in the United States has discovered. They have sent atoms crashing into one another in a particle accelerator to create bloated versions of the elements aluminium and magnesium. The new, artificial forms of these metals have many more neutrons in their atomic nuclei than do the everyday versions. Some theories suggest that this excess of neutrons might make the atoms fall apart because of insufficient ?nuclear glue? to bind all the subatomic particles together. But the researchers found that the new atoms are stable for the fraction of a second needed to detect them. The results should help to guide theories of how atomic nuclei are held together ? which in turn may tell us how elements are formed in stars, and what controls radioactive decay. ?It?s a benchmark measurement for nuclear theory, a test of how good our understanding is,? says team member Bradley Sherrill of Michigan State University in East Lansing. In particular, the stability of one neutron-laden form of aluminium came as a surprise, showing that there?s plenty still to learn.  \n              Come together \n            Atomic nuclei are made up of two types of particle: protons, which have a positive electrical charge, and neutrons, which are electrically neutral. Each distinct chemical element is characterized by a specific number of protons, but can have varying numbers of neutrons. These different versions of an element are called isotopes. Nuclei are held together by the nuclear strong force: a kind of 'glue' that operates between nuclear particles. It is not strong enough to bind protons (which repel one another electrically) or neutrons together on their own. But this 'glue' is slightly stronger between a proton and neutron than between either pair of like particles. As a result, atoms are usually stable so long as the number of protons and neutrons is not too uneven. If this balance isn't right, atoms can split apart through radioactive decay or nuclear fission. If an atom gets too heavy with neutrons, extra neutrons simply won't stick at all ? not even for an instant. Nuclear physicists have long been trying to map out where this boundary of stability lies. They call it the 'neutron drip line', because nuclei larger than this point are like oversized droplets that drip small fragments. Scientists have measured the drip line for elements up to oxygen, with eight protons. But it's harder to determine for heavier elements, whose neutron-rich isotopes don't hang about for long. And different nuclear physics theories don't agree with each other about where the drip line lies. ?For a given number of protons, a nucleus can hold a certain number of neutrons,? says Sherrill. ?But we can?t yet predict exactly how many.?  \n              Supersize atoms \n            Thomas Baumann of the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory at Michigan State University and his collaborators have now pushed these measurements to new extremes.  They fired a beam of high-energy calcium ions into a sheet of tungsten, producing new elements. Among them, neutron-rich versions of aluminium and magnesium could be spotted in the few milliseconds before they decayed. The researchers found an isotope of magnesium with 28 neutrons (magnesium-40) ? more than twice its normal complement. That's bigger than the previous heaviest magnesium isotope found, which had 26 neutrons.  There doesn't seem to be a version of magnesium with 27 neutrons. That fits with the prevailing idea that neutron-rich isotopes with even numbers of both protons and neutrons are more stable than those with odd numbers, because the combinations gain stability from the formation of pairs.  \n              Odd couple \n            Surprisingly, the team found evidence for isotopes of aluminium (which has 13 protons) with both 29 and 30 neutrons. That takes the drip line at aluminium farther out than was expected, and means that aluminium-42, with odd numbers of both neutrons and protons, is stable.  This new view of stability implies that the drip line for aluminium may extend all the way to nuclei with 34 neutrons, although these isotopes haven't been seen. As well as testing nuclear theory, Sherrill says that the results might teach us something about neutron stars: super-dense bodies formed by the collapse of some stars that have exhausted their nuclear fuel. In neutron-rich nuclei, the protons tend to clump in the middle, so that the nuclear surface is almost pure neutrons ? just like the surface of a miniature neutron star. \n                   National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory, Michigan \n                 \n                   JINR Dubna (Russian collaborators) \n                 Reprints and Permissions"},

A push is underway, in the heartland of US dinosaur-hunting country, to introduce new laws to regulate the fate of non-human fossils found on Native American lands. The drive, initiated in Nebraska, is to create legislation similar to that controlling the handling and repatriation of Native American human remains, the 1990 Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act. Nebraska was the first state to enact a law on native human remains, even before the federal act had been passed. On 2 November, the Lincoln-based Nebraska Commission on Indian Affairs is to consider options for a state law covering non-human fossils found on Native American lands. The commission may pass a resolution for a law, or even prepare draft legislation, says Judi Gaiashkibos, the commission's executive director. Suspicion of scientists and their way of dealing with fossils runs deep among Native American political leaders. ?Some scientists still do things deceptively,? says Gaiashkibos. ?To me, it is exploitation.? A complex patchwork of federal and local regulations currently governs fossils found on Native American lands. The lands themselves are a diverse collection of reservation land, land held in trust and privately owned land within a reservation. Palaeontologists routinely work with local tribes, and sometimes Native American students participate in the excavations. Nebraska already has a requirement for scientists to consult with tribes. But such requirements don't go far enough, argues Lawrence Bradley, a doctoral geography student at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. ?In the past, the paradigm was, it was okay to go onto native lands, pull out fossils and have them in a museum for 150 years,? he says. ?I see myself as an ambassador for science, while creating opportunity for Native Americans.? Last week, Bradley presented a poster on what he called questionable collection practices at the annual meeting of the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology in Austin, Texas. These were mostly historical instances of tribes not being consulted by researchers before fossils were removed. Married to a Mescalero Apache, Bradley is a passionate ? some say confrontational ? advocate for Native American rights. For instance, the American Museum of Natural History in New York, which has a fossil collection from the western plains dating from the 1800s, recently declined his requests for physical access to fossils after it was concluded that his correspondence seemed to be threatening to repatriate the fossils. The museum instead pointed him to online databases that it said would provide the information he requested. Bradley is now lobbying US senators and various agencies ? such as the National Park Service, which has responsibility for some Indian lands ? to provide more consultation with tribal leaders before newly discovered fossils are released to scientists for study. His campaign is now bearing some fruit. A new management plan is being considered by National Park Service regional officials for the south unit of Badlands National Park, which covers 540 square kilometres of the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota. Currently, the National Park Service has an agreement with the reservation's Oglala Sioux under which tribal members are consulted about the fate of fossils found on their lands. But it was deemed to be insufficient, so discussions have begun with a view to including fossil discoveries in the park's new 20-year plan, says Rachel Benton, a palaeontologist with the park service. As geological formations there date to about 50 million years ago, the primary impact would be largely on mammal fossils, Benton says. Although there was many a furrowed brow to be seen in front of Bradley's poster ? which referred to ?grave desecration? by pioneering scientific explorers ? some palaeontologists saw advantages in his proposals. One such idea was to create tribal museums, where fossils from Native American lands could be displayed. ?It would be a great idea for teaching natural history to kids,? says Lawrence Flynn, an assistant director at Harvard University's Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Daniel Chaney, a palaeobiologist at the National Museum of Natural History in Washington DC, recalled that as a youth he worked with renowned collectors for the American Museum who would consult with tribal councils, often in the tribe's native language. ?They always went to the landowner,? Chaney says. \n                     Nebraska Commission on Indian Affairs \n                   \n                     National Park Service site on NAGPRA \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Tim Somervaille made a surprising move last month. After four years as a postdoc researching leukaemia at Stanford University in California, he went back home to Britain. In doing so, he joined other European biologists working in US labs who are finding that prospects in their native countries are more enticing than those in their adopted home. Somervaille knew he would return to Britain at some point, but he hadn't expected to be heading back so soon. ?The current funding landscape in Britain is, frankly, way more attractive,? he says. For decades, an abundance of positions, strong funding opportunities and more independence in the lab made the United States the place to be for ambitious European biologists. Now, stagnant budgets at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and increased competition for grants are starting to make America less appealing. And some academics say that they are noticing more researchers heading east across the Atlantic. ?I think people are going back,? says Markus Stoffel, a molecular biologist at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich. Stoffel last year moved from Rockefeller University in New York for family reasons. Since his return, he has seen an increase in the number of job applications to his lab from the United States and Canada. Europeans also seem more interested in staying at home after they graduate, he says: ?For many young people, it's not a must any more to go to the States.? The situation varies hugely from country to country and field to field, but cancer research in Britain offers one example of how the tables may be starting to turn. Since 2002, funding for the UK National Cancer Research Institute has risen by 51% to \u00a3390 million (US$799 million). ?The prospects for funding in the United Kingdom, especially in cancer, are really healthy,? says Nic Jones, director of the Paterson Institute for Cancer Research in Manchester, UK, which will be Somervaille's new home. Meanwhile, the fortunes of cancer researchers in the United States have taken a turn for the worse. As the budget of the NIH doubled in the five years up to 2003, cancer research received an influx of money and people. Since then budgets have stagnated, even declining slightly in the case of the National Cancer Institute. ?I think it's at the stage of a crisis,? says William Hait, president of the American Association for Cancer Research in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Duncan Odom of the Cancer Research UK Cambridge Research Institute agrees. The American-born 37-year-old last year decided to move to Britain from the Whitehead Institute for Biological Research in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Odom says he made the move partly because of the funding situation. The scarcity of US resources has left mid-career researchers scrambling for grants, he says: ?They're getting their knees kicked out from under them.? By contrast, his new institute provides him with a salary and core funding for three postdocs and three graduate students. Odom says that the change has meant less time spent writing grants and more time for his research. But the United States' long-established leadership in cancer research is far from over. Funding may have fallen, and research positions may be more elusive, says John Schiller, an oncology researcher at the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, but there are still huge advantages of scale and resources. ?There are so many people doing so many related things here,? Schiller says, adding that opportunities in the private sector, especially in the US biotechnology industry, remain unrivalled. Even some who have come back to Europe doubt whether they are part of a wider trend. Peter Mombaerts, who is returning to Germany after 12 years at Rockefeller University, says he has yet to see evidence of a broader exodus from the United States. But in some cases, the usual incentives of money and stability are pulling in Europe's direction for a change. The Paterson Institute, for example, offered Somervaille a six-year deal that included salaries for himself, two postdocs and a lab manager. ?I don't have to write any more grants for the next five or six years,? he says. ?For me, the move was a no-brainer.? \n                     Cancer Research UK \n                   \n                     National Cancer Institute \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

A high-level 'science and security commission' is needed in the United States to limit bureaucratic restrictions on research that could thwart terrorist attacks, says a report from the National Academies. The report's authors ? an independent panel convened from the US research and security communities ? agreed that universities must keep an open culture to make discoveries, even if some of those discoveries could be used by terrorists. ?You need to stay ahead,? says Alice Gast, president of Lehigh University in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, and the panel's co-chair. The group also called for an easing of visa, technology-transfer and contract restrictions ? many of which still reflect the mentality of the cold war. Today, international collaboration and rapid communications render many restrictions pointless. Research contracts are particularly troublesome, the panel found. US defence agencies often offer companies contracts that contain clauses preventing the dissemination of knowledge. That presents a problem when the companies subcontract to universities, which have an obligation to publish. The panel also found growing restrictions on research involving 'sensitive but unclassified' technology, a murky term in the view of the panel. According to a Reagan-era presidential directive, research should either be classified and restricted, or unclassified and unrestricted. Government research-contract officers have more incentives to be cautious than open, says Tobin Smith of the Association for American Universities in Washington DC, which advocates fewer research restrictions. ?They don't want to be the ones to blame for a major security breach,? he says. The proposed commission ? which would be co-chaired by the director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) and the president's national security adviser ? would push government agencies to apply more consistent rules. Smith is pleased that the proposed commission involves the national security side as well as the the science side. Having both at the table would increase its effectiveness, he says. Gast says she doesn't know if the commission will be created, but she is pitching the idea to the OSTP, the National Security Council and congressional committees. \n                     US National Academies \n                   \n                     Markle Foundation Task Force on National Security in the Information Age \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

The former drug-company official who heads global health at the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has broken his silence over accusations of acting inappropriately eight years ago, when a physician raised questions about the safety of one of the company's drugs. The drug, Avandia (rosiglitazone), has come under scrutiny this year after two meta-analyses 1 ,   2  concluded that it significantly increases the risks of heart attack. So far, both US and European regulators have kept Avandia on the market, although US officials are considering regulatory action. Fresh questions arose last month after Senator Charles Grassley (Republican, Iowa) made public a 1999 e-mail exchange between Gates official Tachi Yamada \u2014 who was then chief of research and development at Avandia's maker, SmithKline Beecham \u2014 and William Claypool, the company's director of worldwide clinical development. Avandia had just won regulatory approval. But speaking at a scientific meeting 5 days before the exchange, John Buse of the University of North Carolina noted that there were about 50% more cardiovascular deaths in subjects who took Avandia than in those on other diabetes drugs, although the difference was not statistically significant. Buse then mis-stated the cardiovascular death rate of trial subjects taking a placebo drug, saying it was lower than in those on Avandia. He later corrected this in a statement that the company showed to investors. But Claypool wrote to Yamada that Buse had \"repeatedly and intentionally misrepresented Avandia data from the speaker's dais\". He suggested that Buse be warned to stop, \"with the punishment being that we will complain up his academic line\". He added that a lawsuit could be \"reserved for a later approach\". Yamada replied: \"I think that there are two courses of action. One is to sue him for knowingly defaming our product even after we have set him straight as to the facts. The other is to launch a well-planned offensive on behalf of Avandia.\" Yamada recommended the latter. In an interview with  Nature   last week, Yamada said that after receiving Claypool's e-mail he called Buse's boss \"to be certain that he was a legitimate academic\". He said that he was reassured to learn that Buse was \"a qualified scientist making the best of the data that he had\". A careful reading of the e-mails released by Grassley, Yamada added, shows that \"I did not initiate any discussion of a lawsuit [against Buse]\". He added: \"Nor did I ever discuss a lawsuit with anybody else \u2026 I wouldn't want the media to think it's some diabolical plot hatched by me against Dr Buse, because nothing could be further from the truth.\" \"I don't think that Dr Yamada is the bad guy in this story,\" Buse says. \"He did his job and he did it in a fairly sensitive way.\" He adds that he didn't have a problem, then or now, with Yamada calling his chairman to check his credentials. \"That wasn't the disturbing bit. The most disturbing part was the veiled threat of a lawsuit.\" Buse said that the threat came from one of many other company officials who deluged him with phone calls \u2014 prompting him to write to Yamada, asking him to \"call off the dogs\". \n                     Nature Reviews Drug Discovery \n                   \n                     Cardiovascular medicine \n                   \n                     Congressional Record transcript of Claypool-Yamada email exchange 12 September 2007 \n                   \n                     Tachi Yamada biography \n                   \n                     John Buse \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Hold the doors please: teams are scrambling in Utah this weekend to prove that their technologies are the best if you want to get to space in an elevator. The 2007 Space Elevator Games will take place at the Davis County Event Center, after a week of frenetic preparations and qualifying rounds hampered by rain and high winds. The idea of a space elevator is to allow cheap and easy transport of supplies and people to and from a station (or space hotel) in orbit around Earth. The idea has been around for decades, but the technologies needed to support it have yet to be created. To promote development, the California-based non-profit Spaceward Foundation has hosted an annual competition since 2005, supported by a cash prize from NASA. Competing teams don't have to build an actual elevator, but instead aim to build a super-strong tether (similar to what would be needed to support a real elevator), or get a robot to climb a suspended ribbon. Even though previous games have failed to produce a winner (see  Space elevator stuck at ground level ), this year the competition has been made tougher than ever. But the stakes are higher too: NASA has increased the prize pot for both the climber competition and the tether to $500,000 each, from $200,000 each last year.  \n              Social climbing \n            In the robot climber competition, teams have to get their device to hurtle up a 100-metre-long ribbon, suspended from a crane, at an average speed of two metres per second. That's a step up from last year's goal of climbing a 60-metre-long ribbon at one metre per second. The climber must be powered from the ground: strategies include reflecting sunlight from huge mirrors on the ground to solar panels on the climber; shining lasers from the ground up to similar panels on the robot; or firing microwaves up at the climber. Ted Semon, author of the Spaceward Foundation's official space elevator games blog, says that at least four of the returning teams have improved their power delivery significantly during the past year. ?They know what they?re in for,? he says. ?The call for a harder competition this year, in retrospect, was very good,? says Ben Shelef, chief executive of the Spaceward Foundation. He too has been impressed by returning teams: ?They have advanced a lot faster than we have made the competition harder.?  \n              Down to four \n            Qualifying rounds have been taking place all week, although high winds and rain have caused delays. Four out of eight teams have made it into the finals. The Kansas City Space Pirates, with their solar-powered climber, were one of the first teams to qualify, and their test run went \"spectacularly\" says Shelef.  Last year?s closest contenders, the University of Saskatchewan Space Design Team (USST), also qualified. They are one of the hot favourites to win this year, and have upgraded from solar to laser power for this year's attempt. \"I'm very confident,\" says Clayton Ruszkowski, USST team leader. They have a wireless communication system between the lasers on the ground and the climber, which should keep the laser optimally aimed as the climber ascends. The two other teams to qualify are the University of British Colombia's Snowstar, with another solar-powered climber, and a team called Technology Tycoons from Westmont High School.  \n              One on one \n            Only two teams are aiming this year for the tether competition, the winner of which needs to be at least 50% better than last year's best effort. The entrants have to produce a loop of material at least 2 metres in circumference and weighing less than 2 grams. This is then stretched to breaking point, and has to outlast a standard tether made from state-of-the-art material (and not subject to the competition size and weight restrictions).  Stephen Steiner, who leads one of the entries, from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, says he is taking an academic attitude to the games. The MIT tether is the first ever entry to be made entirely of carbon nanotubes ? touted as the most promising material to make a rope strong and light enough to reach space. ?We know that our materials cannot win this year,? he says, but predicts that by 2010 carbon nanotube fibres will be up to the job. The games are set to conclude on Sunday, although bad weather may push this to Monday. Semon is confident that one of the teams will walk away much better off than when they arrived: ?I think we?re actually going to award some prize money this year,? he says.

The discovery in recent years of a handful of rocky planets orbiting stars outside the Solar System has scientists wondering whether those planets are as suitable as Earth for life. This month, two research groups have entered the debate by butting heads over whether active plate tectonics are likely on such planets.  The movement of tectonic plates, which on our own planet created the Himalayas and moved the continents to their current positions, is thought to be important for moderating a planet?s temperature and recycling materials that may nourish life. But do 'super-Earths' ? planets with a mass up to ten times greater than our planet that are solid, unlike the gas giants ? have a similar geology to our home? Diana Valencia, leading a group of scientists at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, says that tectonic plates are inevitible as rocky planets get bigger. As size increases, so does the amount of heat flowing up from the planet?s radioactive core through the gooey mantle. This strikes the planet?s crusty lid with increasing force, eventually breaking it into plates. A preprint of the paper is on Arxiv, and the paper has been accepted for publication in  Astrophysical Journal Letters 1 . Valencia?s logic follows from the limited trend available in the Solar System: Mars, Mercury and rocky moons lack plate tectonics. Venus, the second largest rocky planet, may have had active plates in the past. The biggest, Earth, is the only one with plate tectonics. ?It might not be a coincidence,? says Valencia.  \n              Solid surface \n            But Earth might be an anomaly, and the trend might not extend to bigger rocky planets says Craig O?Neill, a planetary scientist at Macquarie University in Sydney, Australia.  O?Neill and his group have come to the exact opposite conclusion to Valencia. Their model, published in  Geophysical Research Letters 2 , shows that as a planet gets bigger, the increasing force of gravity squeezes crustal rocks together into a solid lid, making it more difficult for forces from below to crack it into plates. A large, capped-lid planet could be like Venus, with a hellish atmosphere and runaway greenhouse effect. It could be cold and dead like Earth's Moon. Or, if fed by internal heat from the core, it could vent that heat through massive bouts of volcanism, as on Io, a moon of Jupiter. That doesn't necessarily rule out life, but it might make it difficult.  \n              Far from home \n            Some scientists say both papers are premature. Science doesn?t even understand plate tectonics on Earth, so it shouldn?t be making predictions for other worlds, says Dave Stevenson, a planetary scientist at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena.  ?Both papers are somewhat speculative and quite a long way removed from anything that?s likely to be confirmed in the future with observation,? says Stevenson. The models both neglect the crucial influence of water, which softens up and lubricates tectonic plates. They also make assumptions about parameters, such as the viscosity of the mantle or the strength of the crust, for which the values are unknown to within several orders of magnitude. Researchers on both sides of the debate welcome critique, arguing that the community needs to grapple with these questions now.  Valencia points out that scientists need to prepare for planet-hunting projects such as NASA?s Kepler and Terrestrial Planet Finder missions. One of her co-authors, Dimitar Sasselov, who is director of the Harvard University Origins of Life Initiative, says that five years ago, nobody cared about modelling tectonics on super-Earths.

HIV-positive individuals who have no symptoms but who carry high levels of the virus in their blood have long been considered the most likely to spread HIV. But researchers have now found that those with only moderate levels of the virus have a greater chance of transmitting HIV to others in the long term.  The reason, says epidemiologist Christophe Fraser of Imperial College London, is that those with 'intermediate viral loads' remain asymptomatic longer, giving them more opportunities to disseminate the virus. ?Those who have the highest viral loads are a bit more infectious, but their duration of infection is much shorter,? says Fraser. The findings, reported by Fraser and his team, suggest that ?imperfect? treatments that only partially reduce viral loads could have the unwanted side effect of enhancing disease transmission, the researchers say. The number of viral particles in the blood is used as a measure of the severity of HIV infection. The more particles someone has, the worse the prognosis and the greater the chances of infecting others.  During the asymptomatic period that precedes the development of AIDS, the amount of virus carried by untreated individuals fluctuates around a steady set-point value. That value varies among individuals, and generally ranges from one thousand to one million copies of virus per millilitre of blood. Fraser and his colleagues analysed data collected from more than 100 HIV-positive homosexual men from 1982 to 1993 (before protease inhibitors, a critical component of modern HIV treatment regimes, were introduced). They found that the length of the asymptomatic period varied from 15.6 years for those with a set-point viral load of one thousand to only 2.1 years for those with a set point of one million. With this in mind, the researchers then reanalysed data from knowingly HIV-positive heterosexual subjects in Uganda and Zambia who had HIV-negative sexual partners. Those with a viral load of one million particles per millilitre were more than ten times more likely to accidentally infect their partners each year than those with a load of one thousand.  \n              Long-term danger \n            But when the researchers calculated the transmission potential over the entire predicted asymptomatic period, those with viral loads between ten thousand and a hundred thousand copies per millilitre of blood were the most likely to infect their partners. HIV-positive subjects with viral counts of 50,000 infected roughly twice as many people as those with counts of one million. ?People who are the most infectious over the long term are those with intermediate viral loads,? says Fraser.  Intermediate viral loads are the most common ones among untreated individuals, suggesting that the virus may have evolved to maximize its transmission by constraining viral populations within the host to moderate levels, Fraser adds. The findings are interesting, agrees Lo\u00a3c Desquilbet, an epidemiologist at the  National Institute of Agronomy in Paris. But, he adds, studies of pre-1993 data may have limited relevance for today's epidemic because modern HIV treatments typically reduce viral loads below the intermediate range. \"If you treat a person, in most cases you decrease the viral load well below 10,000 copies,\" says Desquilbet. \"It's important to focus on maintaining adherence to the treatment.\" \n                   AIDS web special \n                 \n                   Nature Medicine blog \n                 \n                   Nature Insight: AIDS \n                 \n                   Christophe Fraser  \n                 \n                   Imperial College Disease Ecology group \n                 \n                   Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA \n                 Reprints and Permissions"},

The most primitive bat ever discovered is finally being scientifically reported, years after the first fossil was found and snapped up by a private collector. The 52.5-million-year-old bat unusually had a claw on all five digits of each limb, earning it the nickname '20-clawed bat'. Its anatomy shows that it captured its prey without the use of echolocation \u2014 the strongest evidence yet that some bats flew before this skill evolved. Bats are thought to have evolved from flightless tree-dwelling creatures, and also developed specialized echolocation to detect their small prey at night. Which came first has been a matter of some debate. \u201cThis tells us there was flight before echolocation,\u201d says Nancy Simmons, the chief mammal curator at the American Museum of Natural History in New York. \u201cSo the question we have to answer now is: how did it catch its prey?\u201d Simmons and her colleagues reported on two individual fossils of the new bat late last week in a lecture at the 67th annual meeting of the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology (SVP) in Austin, Texas. The team has submitted an article naming and fully describing the species to a scientific journal.  Bats today make up about 20% of living mammals. There are an estimated 1,100 species, with new ones reported regularly. The previous oldest bat found is from the same place and age as the new species, but the new find has more primitive features.  \n              Private buyer \n            Both fossils of the new bat originally came from the Green River Formation, a famous deposit in the US Fossil Butte National Monument park in southwestern Wyoming. But they took a convoluted route through commercial fossil-dealers between being found and described. Some half a dozen fossil-hunting firms are licensed by the federal government to dig in Fossil Butte, where layers of shale peel apart like the pages of a book to reveal marine and land life from the early Eocene, around 50 million years ago. About six years ago, one of these commercial firms found the first of the two bat fossils now being described. When the shale sections were separated, the bat's skull burst into pieces. But the remaining skeleton shows intriguing features, including the clawed digits. As often occurs, the dealer took the specimen to the annual fossil show in Tucson, Arizona, from which it was eventually purchased by William Ziff, the New York-based publisher of PC Magazine and others. Casts were made of the fossil, one of which was analysed by Simmons's co-author Greg Gunnell, the palaeontology museum collections coordinator at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. Gunnell gave a brief report based on the cast at a previous SVP meeting in 2003, but this work was insufficient for describing a new species.  \n              Museum owned \n            Meanwhile, another co-author on the new paper, Kevin Seymour of the Royal Ontario Museum in Toronto, started looking for a second specimen among commercial dealers. His perseverence paid off. The Royal Ontario Museum purchased this second fossil in 2004, before it had been scraped away from the surrounding rock. A museum technician spent months meticulously cleaning the skull and uncovering the claws, resulting in a fossil good enough to describe the species. Features in the sinuses and skull revealed that the bat could not echolocate. Palaeontologists have long fought to regulate more closely the commercial collection of fossils, in part to prevent this kind of delay in describing new species. The latest bill on this ( S. 320 ) is now before the US Senate, although a House version of the bill has been stuck in committee since April. Officials from the American Museum of Natural History are negotiating to purchase the original first specimen from the estate of Ziff, who died last year. \n                   Fossil Butte National Archive \n                 \n                   William B.

A twenty-year-old university student has answered a challenge by one of the world's most well-known mathematicians. Alex Smith, a undergraduate electrical engineering student at the University of Birmingham in the United Kingdom, has proven that a primitive type of computer known as a 2,3 Turing machine can solve every computational problem there is. Proving the \"universality\" of the 2,3 Turing machine was the subject of a US$25,000 challenge from entrepreneur and mathematician Stephen Wolfram. Wolfram, founder and chief executive of Wolfram Research in Champaign, Illinois, issued the challenge this May to satisfy his own curiosity about how complexity emerges from simple systems. The idea is that a properly applied set of basic rules can create an enormously intricate result. \"It's actually a lot easier to make complexity than one might have thought,\" he says. \"I find it particularly tantalizing.\" Turing machines were imagined by the British mathematician Alan Turing in 1936, and consist of a read?write head that can be put into one of several states and a long strip of tape on which can be written a set of colours. At each step, the machine looks at the state of the head and the colours on the tape. It then uses a set of fixed rules to move the state of the head into a new position and write a new row of colours on the tape (see picture).  \n              Intricate patterns \n            The machine specific to Wolfram's prize has a head with only two states and a tape that can hold three colours. It is one of the simplest kind of Turing machines, but depending on the first row on the tape, the results can be remarkably intricate, according to Smith. \"Even if you know the rules, you don't necessarily know how it will behave,\" he says. Smaller, simpler Turing machines are possible (such as 1,2 for example) but these are not thought to be capable of universality. Smith learned about Wolfram's challenge in an Internet chat room and almost immediately went to work fiddling with the machine. After learning its behaviour, he set about proving that it was computationally equivalent to another type of simple, conceptual computer known as a tag system.  Mathematicians have already shown that tag systems can compute any problem, so proving the two were equivalent effectively proved the power of Wolfram's machine. Smith's  proof  is 44 pages long. The solution isn't hugely relevant to modern computer science, says Scott Aaronson, a computer scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Cambridge, Massachusetts. \"Most theoretical computer scientists don't particularly care about finding the smallest universal Turing machines,\" he wrote in an e-mail. \"They see it as a recreational pursuit that interested people in the 60s and 70s but is now sort of 'retro'.\" Nevertheless, Lenore Blum, a researcher at the Carnegie Mellon University in Pittburgh, Pennylvania, who served on Wolfram's Prize committee, says the find is interesting enough on its own to warrant attention. \"This could stimulate some new work,\" she says. For his part, Smith, now in the third year of his electrical engineering degree, says that he has no big plans for his prize money. \"I'm just going to put it in the bank,\" he says.

Stem-cell researchers in Italy are worried that a shake-up of the country's bioethics advisory body could hinder a balanced representation of their ethical position on embryonic stem-cell research. Members of the National Bioethics Committee are nominated directly by the Italian prime minister, and have in the past been predominantly Catholic. The group expresses opinions on and suggests solutions to bioethical issues, and helps prepare legislation on relevant topics. In October 2000, the committee, which at the time included a number of scientists and independent thinkers, expressed a favourable opinion toward embryonic stem-cell research. But in 2002, then prime minister Silvio Berlusconi renewed the committee, and since then there has been increasing conflict between its Catholic and secular members. Then in 2004, the parliament approved one of the most restrictive laws worldwide on stem-cell research. Last year, the current prime minister, Romano Prodi, streamlined the committee from 52 to 40 members, and increased the percentage of women from 25% to almost 40%. The proportion of Catholic members remained at well over 50%. Prodi also appointed as the committee's president 76-year-old Francesco Casavola, a former president of Italy's supreme court, who is currently director of the Treccani Institute. Casavola, a moderate Catholic, appointed two secular members and one Catholic member as vice-presidents. They were Cinzia Caporale, a bioethicist and former president of the UNESCO (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization) Intergovernmental Bioethics Committee; Elena Cattaneo, a stem-cell researcher at the University of Milan; and Luca Marini, a lecturer in European Union Law at the University of Rome La Sapienza. The new committee was fractious from the start. Almost half its members advocated changing the voting system from a simple majority ? perhaps to a system that describes, with justifications, the range of views across the committee. This is similar to the way in which the German National Ethics Council works. ?Such a procedure encourages a constructive discussion and diminishes conflicts,? says Jens Reich, former deputy chair of the German group. On 18 September, three members of the Italian committee wrote an internal memo criticizing what they called Casavola's unilateral way of making decisions. In particular, they criticized his decision to choose members of the influential public group Science and Life, which strongly opposes research on embryonic stem cells, as committee representatives on important national and international panels. For example, the committee's representative on the commission that is revising the reproductive-technology law is the president of Science and Life. The letter was leaked to the press, and Casavola tendered his resignation. At the end of September, Prodi asked him to stay and ratified Casavola's proposal to replace the three vice-presidents with new ones: a rabbi, a Catholic who takes secular positions, and a member of Science and Life. On 8 October, Casavola wrote in a letter to the committee that the former vice-presidents had not adequately defended him against growing criticism. Prodi's undersecretary Giampaolo D'Andrea, defending Casavola's decision to a parliamentary commission, said that there were ?inner conflicts between the vice-presidents?, a point that members of the committee strongly contest. The current situation worries Cattaneo. ?Italian science needs to rise to the level of other European countries,? she says, ?which means also having an institution able to make decisions that can strike an appropriate balance between medical benefits and justified ethical concerns of the nation.? In what is likely to be a turbulent meeting on 26 October, the committee will have to produce advice about the time at which an embryo can be considered dead and could be used for research. ?But with the current unbalanced representation,? says Carlo Redi, a stem-cell researcher and scientific adviser at the San Matteo Hospital in Pavia, ?I can hardly imagine that there could be good news for science?. \n                     Nature Reports Stem Cells \n                   \n                     Stem cells in Focus \n                   \n                     Italian National Bioethics Committee \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Nanoparticles are set to lose their air of mystery: the structure of a widely used class of gold nanoparticle has been unambiguously determined, and the structures of other nanoparticles could soon follow. The structure reveals that the molecules grown on the surface of the gold nanoparticles don?t behave quite as they were thought to.  Gold metallic nanoparticles are commonly used in the lab as a tracer, to detect the presence of specific proteins or DNA in a sample, for example. Such nanoparticles have proved to be adaptable, and so very useful. Surprisingly, no one had a clear idea what these particles looked like ? perhaps they were colloidal, with a lumpy, messy range of shapes and sizes; or maybe they were discrete molecules of uniform size and structure. \"Exactly what the structure was, remained kind of murky,\" says nanoparticle expert Ralph Nuzzo from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, who was not involved with this work. Researchers have now succeeded in making a crystal structure of gold nanoparticles, and imaging this crystal to see inside the particles themselves and unpick their structure. The result settles some mysteries, and should also make the nanoparticles even easier to adapt and use.  \n              Stuck together \n            Gold is used for nanoparticle applications because it is unreactive and isn?t sensitive to air or light. But gold does like to form bonds with itself. So to make sure the particles don?t clump together, their surfaces have to be covered with a layer of protective molecules. Sulphur is one of a few elements that gold happily bonds with, so sulphur-containing groups are often used for this protective coating. These sulphur groups can also be functionalized ? given extra bits such as binding sites or fluorescent markers, for example, that can be picked up by a microscope. This turns the nanoparticles into tracers. Roger Kornberg at Stanford University, California, and his team investigated the chemistry of such particles by creating a crystal of them ? a huge achievement in itself ? that could be investigated using X-ray crystallography. The particles they investigated consist of 102 gold atoms arranged in a ball and covered on the surface by a one-molecule-thick layer of 44 sulphur-containing molecules.  A clear, three-dimensional picture of the structure of this monster molecule, reported in  Science , reveals that atoms in the core of this nanoparticle are arranged similarly to those in bulk gold, as expected. But this 'grand core' is then surrounded by two caps, each with 15 slightly twisted gold atoms. And the sulphur groups, rather than binding directly to the gold surface as predicted in some models, forms an alliance with the outermost shell of gold, which then interacts weakly with the grand core. In addition to that, the nanoparticle is chiral ? it has a handedness ? introduced by the arrangement of the gold atoms with the sulphur groups.  \n              Off the shelf \n            \"Chemists and nanoscientists have worked for years with metal-rich gold cluster thiolates, without any unambiguous evidence of their structure,\" says Robert Whetten of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta. This new structure changes everything, he says. \"Chemists treat something very differently when it is a substance that has a determined composition and structure. It can be handled, and bought and sold just like any other speciality chemical off the shelf.\" This knowledge might eventually help to remove the suspicion that surrounds nanoparticles and their toxicity, researchers add. Knowing the structure of a molecule means researchers can better understand how it reacts.  \"It means we have the potential to understand nanoparticles, to understand the chemistry on their surfaces,\" says Simon Billinge, part of the National Science Foundation-funded Nanoscale Interdisiplinary Research Team, based at Michigan State University, East Lansing. \"This is precisely the kind of discovery that finds its way in to textbooks,\" says Whetten. \n                   Nature nanotechnology \n                 \n                   Roger Kornberg's laboratory \n                 Reprints and Permissions"},

But with researchers drowning in a sea of biomarkers and little financial incentive to get the tests on the shelves, the idea is floundering. Virginia Gewin reports. The genomic revolution brought in its wake the promise that it would be possible to detect ?and arrest ? the earliest signs of cancer. By tapping in to molecular biomarkers, initial signs of disease would be seen and effective treatments implemented. That promise remains resolutely unfulfilled. In laboratories around the world, the discovery of candidate biomarkers continues apace. But the process of developing them into diagnostic tests is stalling. No early detection diagnostic test has so far been approved by regulatory bodies. Industry observers say a major problem is that there is no way to validate candidate biomarkers with the certainty that would merit their development into a marketable test. And the sheer number of candidates makes it hard to select which ones should be more fully developed. For their part, doctors want tests that identify the proper treatment course for individual patients. It is unclear whether they will adopt biomarker tests that serve only as diagnostics and don't point the way to specific therapies. ?Biomarkers are only as good as their ability to link to the treatment or pathology of the disease,? says Harvey Pass, a clinician working on detection biomarkers for mesothelioma at New York University Medical Center. Back in 2000, the US National Cancer Institute established the Early Detection Research Network (EDRN) in a bid to bridge the validation gap. The network sought to establish some of the infrastructure needed to test and validate candidate biomarkers. This is complicated by the fact that diagnostic tests often need to feature several markers to ensure that they are statistically significant.  \n                On trial \n              In its draft assessment, the network reports movement on several fronts. Of the thousands of candidate biomarkers so far discovered, the EDRN is backing 120 in various stages of development. Among these, biomarkers for five cancers ? mesothelioma, and liver, bladder, prostate and lung cancers ? are in their third and final phase of development, and are being tested for effectiveness in large-scale human trials. One of the EDRN's collaborators is Cangen Biotechnologies of Baltimore, Maryland, which hopes to put the first DNA-based early detection test for bladder cancer on the market. Cangen is confident that its test ? a panel of 15 DNA segments ? can identify tumours well ahead of existing diagnostics. But although detection may come a little earlier, a patient's primary treatment option remains the same: surgery. That means that the overall impact on patient survival rates may be relatively small. For Eddy Agbo, Cangen's research director, linking the test to new drug therapies that could combat these early tumours is the next step forward. But in the absence of such therapies, there isn't a huge incentive for doctors and the health-care insurers that pay for most medical services in the United States to buy the tests. Given its resources, the pharmaceutical industry would seem to be well placed to take candidate diagnostics tests through to approval. But rather than early detection tests, the industry seems more keen on using biomarkers to pinpoint patient suitability for treatment with particular drugs. There have been isolated successes for this approach, notably the targeting of the breast-cancer drug Herceptin, made by Genentech in South San Francisco, California. Herceptin targets patients who over-express a particular receptor and had sales of US$1.3 billion last year. Everyone is looking for a dramatic demonstration of biomarker success, says Sam Hanash, a molecular biologist at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, Washington. The bottleneck isn't the lab-based discovery science, but the ability to efficiently weed through the overwhelming number of candidate genes, proteins and even microRNAs that could be clinically useful. ?It's like the Wild West ? anyone can stake claim to a biomarker,? says Hanash.  \n                Setting standards \n              The EDRN has done what it can to find some of the most promising markers and get them into trials. The network has made available cancerous and control reference tissue, serum and blood samples for lung, breast, ovarian, prostate and colon tumours. These can be used as the first step in validation by scientists claiming a biomarker. The EDRN has also established quality-control for validation testing, a standardized system for presenting data, and, with other groups at the National Cancer Institute, has established the beginnings of large-scale human biosample collection. These steps are necessary, specialists say, but may not be sufficient to bring biomarker tests to market. The EDRN provides a valuable but incomplete resource, says Mike Gillette, a proteomics researcher at the Broad Institute in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Further validation steps require large-scale trials on broader populations, which are expensive and so temper industry interest. In July, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) addressed industry concerns about the approval process by publishing draft guidelines for tests that use multiple biomarkers. Yet to be finalized, the regulations make an important distinction: class II tests, which are merely diagnostic or prognostic, can be validated using trials on tissue-bank samples. But class III tests, which are those that also indicate which therapies should be used, must undergo a more costly trial in which patients are tracked in the future. The shallow pockets of most diagnostic testing companies can't support the multimillion-dollar costs of even the class II trials. ?You need pushers and drivers to develop biomarkers,? says Pat Price, a clinical researcher for Cancer Research UK at the University of Manchester, ?and those are usually the drug companies.? Price predicts that the drug industry will become steadily more interested in biomarkers as it comes to see its future in more segmented markets for drugs effective in particular genetic subpopulations. She says that, in general, the middle ground between biomarker discovery and the clinic is neglected by funding agencies and so is unattractive to researchers. The EDRN is an exception ? but it spends its $28-million budget validating only diagnostic or prognostic biomarkers. According to Pass in New York, collaboration with the network has been invaluable to develop early detection biomarkers for mesothelioma. He and others are now pushing for the EDRN to develop biomarkers for therapeutic prediction to complete the continuum of treatment. Murray Robinson, a senior vice-president at AVEO Pharmaceuticals in Cambridge, Massachusetts, says that the success of Herceptin has made parts of the pharmaceutical industry sit up and take notice. Larger companies, such as Roche of Switzerland, are vigorously exploring the co-development of biomarkers for particular diseases and drugs to treat them. That approach may have diminished the firm's interest in stand-alone tests developed by smaller companies. Ren\u00e9 Bernards, chief scientific officer of Agendia, a cancer-diagnostics company in Amsterdam, is disappointed by the lack of interest drug companies have shown in his firm's test. MammaPrint, which predicts the likelihood of breast-cancer recurrence, is the first multigene prognostic test to be approved by the FDA. ?If it's clear that the FDA is going to regulate this space of biomarkers, and ours is the only company to clear a multigene biomarker through the FDA, you would think a few large pharmaceutical companies would want to collaborate,? he says.

He talks to Alison Abbott about his new project to map the genetics of Italy. Luigi Luca Cavalli-Sforza, professor emeritus at Stanford University in Palo Alto, California, invented the concept of geographical genetics. He is most famous for demonstrating that the practice of agriculture spread not by word of mouth but as farmers migrated to different regions. But his attempt to systematically document the extent of human genetic diversity ? by collecting cell lines from tribes and other populations ? embroiled him in one of the major scientific controversies of the 1990s: the Human Genome Diversity Project was nearly crushed by charges of exploitation and racism. Now, at the age of 85, he has launched the Italian Genome Project in his home country. \n              You were probably the first geneticist to investigate human genetic diversity. What prompted your interest? \n            I switched from bacterial to human genetics in the 1950s. I wanted to try to quantify the role of chance in evolution, and distinguish its effects from that of natural selection. I was living in Italy, where the Catholic church provided good demographic records going back to the sixteenth century. This allowed me to follow the migration of individuals and the sizes of local populations over time. I compared the frequencies of genes in small isolated villages in the mountains with those in larger towns of the valley of Parma, where my university was. Of course, back then we couldn?t look at genes directly, so we used the surrogate of blood groups. I was able to show that random genetic drift, then the Cinderella of evolution, could explain a great fraction of genetic variation, whereas ? at least with the numbers I was looking at ? the evidence for natural selection over the centuries was remarkably scanty.  \n              Where did you look next? \n            I wanted to understand human genetic diversity in a more global way, and try to get a glimpse of the past. So I went to study the African pygmies, one of the few remaining hunter-gatherers whose environment had not been disturbed. I found that random genetic drift was also important in pygmy tribes and could also be used to follow the movements of migrating subpopulations. I started a collaboration with a young archaeologist, Albert Ammerman, to study how the expansion and consequent migrations of populations could have affected the present genetic structure of Europe. This was the start of two decades of research which inspired the concept of the Human Genome Diversity Project and eventually it led me to the Italian Genome Project.  \n              Were you taken aback by the opposition to the Human Genome Diversity Project? \n            Yes, because the objections came from strange, unexpected sources, motivated by politics rather than science. Some activists were really interested in self-promotion. People accused us of exploitation, but it was not generally the aboriginals themselves who said they felt exploited, but their self-selected representatives. Then there were the people who thought we were paid by the pharmaceutical industry, even though we had prescribed that DNA could be distributed only to publicly funded research labs. I think that some fears had to do with the statements that DNA might be used to make claims of territorial rights.  Many of the objections seemed so absurd that they were hard to predict.  \n              How did you feel about being accused of racism? \n            Well, many mistakes are made and that was a very curious one. I?d argued for decades that the concept of ?race? defined by external characteristics ? such as skin colour, size variations or facial fat ? is nonsense. These visible characteristics evolved under natural selection, mostly to cope with local environments, and have no deeper base. I didn?t get angry or depressed, I only regretted how much time the objections cost to the project development.  \n              Did the Human Genome Diversity Project suffer as a result? \n            It took me eleven years to get the project going, and that was far too long. As a result, it has so far obtained not many more than one-tenth of the planned 10,000 DNA samples, and some important parts of the world have still not been covered.  \n              What exactly is the Italian Genome Project? \n            The idea emerged seven years ago, but it is only now taking off. We are collecting blood samples from about 100 people in each of Italy?s 100 or so provinces ? 10,000 in all. The people are being selected from among regular blood donors on the basis of surnames that identify their local origin. We have generated a long list of such surnames. We collect them in villages and small towns, not in cities where you get complex admixtures. We now have nearly 1,000 samples, from one province in each of Italy?s twenty regions. Their leopard-spot distribution will give us a basic knowledge of the country?s population from a genetic point of view.  The DNA samples will be analysed with a megachip, which can detect around half a million SNPs [single-point differences between genes]. Of course it would be better to be able to fully sequence each individual genome, but the cost is prohibitive at the moment. These massive new megachips allow analysis to be carried out at a cost of around $1,000 per sample and provide enough information for powerful studies.  \n              What will the information be used for? \n            It?s mainly intended to provide control samples for medical genetics. These days medical geneticists mostly do ?case control? studies, in which patients are matched with a control population. Getting a good genetic match with healthy controls of the same origins allows you to do a statistically strong study with fewer people. Our collection will make it easier to find a close genetic match.  Of course the sample will also be used for studies of geographical genetics and evolutionary biology ? after all this is my oldest curiosity.  \n              Were you not concerned that the Italian Genome Project would face the same objections as the Human Genome Diversity Project? \n            Not really. I was helped by the national organization for blood donors in Italy (AVIS). This has more than a million members who are called on individually when a particular blood group is needed. Volunteer (unpaid) blood donors are already committed to helping medicine.  We have also developed a fool-proof method for protecting individual identity.  \n              Should every country have its own genome project? \n            I believe every country with a substantial national health programme would gain from having its own genome project, given the effect of genetic disease and disease predisposition.  There are a lot of big projects in Europe ? particularly in Iceland and Estonia, where very large proportions of the population are being tested. The Italian project is perhaps closest to the programme funded by the Wellcome Trust called ?The People of Great Britain?. The European Union is planning to fund the coordination of national projects, and we will certainly consider collaborating in any Europe-wide plan that emerges.  \n              In retrospect, do you think that the Human Genome Diversity Project can be considered a success? \n            I think so. At the last count 93 research laboratories have requested and obtained the project's DNA set, and many publications have already appeared. We have just finished the first megachip study on this data set and confirmed that there is a progressive loss of genetic diversity the farther you get from East Africa, from where we believe  Homo sapiens  emerged. The recent ?Out of Africa? theory is now on a very firm basis. \n                   Human Genome Diversity Project \n                 Reprints and Permissions"},

A malaria vaccine trial in Mozambique has shown that the treatment is safe and effective for babies aged just a few weeks. The research brings the vaccine a step closer to widespread use; good news particularly for young infants, who are most at risk of being killed by the disease. There is still no clinically approved vaccine for malaria, which kills more than a million people each year, many of them babies and most in Africa. The World Health Organization estimates that a child dies of malaria roughly every 30 seconds. The latest trial raises hopes that the malaria vaccine riddle has been cracked, and that babies can now be protected for the first two years of their lives: a strategy that could prevent millions of deaths. Details of the trial, published in  The Lancet 1 , are revealed as malaria experts meet this week in Seattle at a conference organized by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation to discuss future strategies for tackling the disease.  \n              Infant infections \n            The latest trial is the first to investigate the effects of an experimental vaccine called RTS,S in very young babies. In 2004, a team led by Pedro Alonso of the Barcelona Centre for International Health Research in Spain showed that RTS,S provides some protection in children aged 1?4 for around 18 months. But malaria experts agree that a vaccine is most useful if given as soon as possible after birth. So the same group tested the vaccine on 214 infants in Mozambique, where malaria is rife and infection can occur all year round. Half of the children were given RTS,S in a series of jabs at ages 10 weeks, 14 weeks and 18 weeks. The rest of the children were given a vaccine against hepatitis B to ensure that effects seen in the malaria-vaccine group were down to the drug, not the immunization method. In the vaccinated group, there were 22 cases of infection with the malaria parasite,  Plasmodium falciparum , over the 6-month study period ? compared with 46 cases in the non-malaria-vaccinated group. Overall, the vaccine was roughly 66% effective, the researchers report. \"The vaccine has partial efficacy, so this will be another tool in the arsenal,\" says Christian Loucq, director of the PATH Malaria Vaccine Initiative, based in Bethesda, Maryland, which sponsored the research. Existing anti-malaria measures such as bednets and insecticide spraying of houses will still be essential in combating the disease, Loucq stresses.  \n              Aim for 2013 \n            Although not 100% effective, the new vaccine, developed by GlaxoSmithKline, overcomes several technological hurdles. The complex life cycle of  P. falciparum  makes malaria a more evasive vaccine target than other types of disease, such as those caused by bacteria or viruses. Loucq admits that researchers still do not really know how the new vaccine works, although they suspect that it encourages the body to create antibodies against the parasite during the first few minutes after infection occurs, before the invading parasite heads for the liver.  The Malaria Vaccine Initiative is now planning larger trials of RTS,S, with the aim of further demonstrating its usefulness, Loucq says. A trial involving some 16,000 children in seven countries is scheduled to begin in late 2008, and Loucq hopes that it will be approved for widespread use by 2013. It remains difficult to predict how much the vaccine will cost, and what proportion of available health funding should be spent on it, Loucq says. \"At this level, cost estimates are difficult to get,\" he says. \"But I don't think price will be an issue ? big organizations will step up.\" \n                   Malaria special  \n                 \n                   PATH Malaria Vaccine Initiative  \n                 \n                   Barcelona Centre for International Health Research  \n                 \n                   NIH Malaria Vaccine Development Branch  \n                 \n                   Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation  \n                 \n                   Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria  \n                 \n                   Roll Back Malaria Partnership  \n                 Reprints and Permissions"},

Rumours of construction delays at the world's largest particle accelerator have exaggerated the size of the problem, according to the project's head. ?There have been no show stoppers,? wrote Robert Aymar, director-general of CERN, the particle physics lab near Geneva, Switzerland, in the 8 October issue of the lab's  CERN Bulletin.  ?We can all look forward to the LHC producing its first physics in 2008.? His reassuring announcement came after gossip on physics blogs of new problems that could set the lab's Large Hadron Collider (LHC) even further behind its already delayed start date. But for all the reassurance, the LHC schedule remains tight, says project leader Lyn Evans. Relatively small mishaps could push the opening back beyond July 2008, when the LHC is supposed to start doing physics. The machine is a CHF10-billion (US$8.4-billion) accelerator designed to slam protons into each other at energies of up to 14 teraelectronvolts ? 7 times the current record. Detectors will comb through the debris from the collisions for evidence of the Higgs mechanism, which is believed to endow all other particles with mass, and for signs of physics beyond the 'standard model', the current theoretical framework of particle physics. LHC construction has already faced a number of setbacks and delays. For example, in March, a support holding a superconducting magnet in one section of the machine failed, leaving engineers scrambling for a fix (see  Nature   doi:10.1038/news070402-3  ; 2007). The latest round of speculation was sparked in September when engineers found that several pieces of tubing between magnets had crumpled as the machine was being prepared for servicing. Just six out of 424 sections collapsed, according to Raymond Veness, who leads the LHC's vacuum engineering team. But the failures blocked the beam line, along which particles will eventually travel. ?This is a potentially nasty problem,? Veness says. For the time being, engineers have improvised a solution. Using compressed air, they are firing a small plastic ball equipped with a radio-transmitter through the line. By detecting where the ball comes to a halt, they have been able to spot collapsed sections in a matter of minutes. But changing the defective sections, a half-day task, adds to an already full maintenance schedule. ?Everyone is stretched in all directions,? adds Veness. ?I don't think anyone sees it as an insurmountable problem,? says Peter Limon, a high-energy physicist at Fermilab in Batavia, Illinois, the only other lab currently working with very high-energy protons. But whether the July date can be met will depend on how the magnet systems behave in additional tests this winter, says Evans. A magnet or other component failure in a section of the ring cooled to liquid helium temperatures for testing could set things back by months because of the time needed to warm the section up for repairs and cool it back down. ?The next three months are going to be pretty critical,? says Evans. ?If something unforeseen comes up between now and then, it will slip.

A bipartisan group of US senators unveiled a much anticipated climate bill today, paving the way for the first legislative action on global warming under the new Democratic majority.  The legislation would require some industries to reduce their greenhouse-gas emissions to 1990 levels by 2020, and by a further 65% by mid-century. The emissions caps would be mandatory for some sectors of industry, including energy and transportation but not agriculture, and cover about 75% of the US economy.  Introduced by Senators John Warner (Republican, Virginia) and Joe Lieberman (Independent, Connecticut), the America's Climate Security Act also has the backing of leading Democrats. Other climate-change bills are on the US table, but this one, being bipartisan, is poised to be first to start moving through the legislative process. ?Today will be remembered as a turning point in the fight against global warming,? says Senator Barbara Boxer (Democrat, California), who chairs the committee that has jurisdiction over the bill. ?We have the framework here. Every single issue that any one could raise about global warming has been raised in this bill, giving us the perfect place to start.? The short-term targets in the America's Climate Security Act are weaker than the global reductions to below 1990 levels by 2012 called for in the Kyoto agreement, which the United States has not signed up to. But they are stronger than some other proposals on the table in the United States, making it something of a compromise bill.  \n              Early days \n            Advocates lauded the bipartisan agreement as a landmark achievement on an issue that has been highly polarized in the United States. But the debate is far from over. Many environmentalists are backing a competing bill ? co-sponsored by Boxer ? that requires even larger reductions, whereas many industry officials support a third proposal by Senators Jeff Bingaman (Democrat, New Mexico) and Arlen Specter (Republican, Pennsylvania). The Bingaman?Specter proposal would require the United States to cut emissions to 1990 levels by 2030 and make further reductions ? to 60% below 2006 levels by 2050 ? contingent on action by other countries. Boxer plans to start deliberations on the bill next week, but few expect Congress to get very far on the issue this year. Democrats are still trying to craft legislation in the House, and time is running short on the legislative calendar.  Although lawmakers and some environmentalists remain hopeful that a bill could be passed by the Congress next year, a potential veto by President Bush hangs over the debate as well. Many experts expect the process to extend well into 2009 or even 2010, after a new president takes the helm.  \n              Warts and all \n            ?From our standpoint, it?s a good-faith political compromise, but it seems very unlikely to go very far unless President Bush does an unexpected 180 degree reversal,? says Frank O?Donnell, president of the advocacy group Clean Air Watch in Washington DC. ?And it?s got some very significant warts.?  The bill would create a cap-and-trade system to manage carbon emissions, similar to that established under the Kyoto agreement. But the legislation would grant free emissions credits at the beginning, rather than auctioning them off to the highest bidder. O?Donnell says that amounts to a windfall for industry. And since the bill exempts agriculture and other major sectors, he says the actual reductions in the bill come out to about 51% of overall US emissions by mid-century. Reprints and Permissions"},

Researchers delving into the DNA of Neanderthal remains have found the human form of a gene crucial for the development of language. The result indicates that this modern form of the gene could have appeared much earlier than previously thought ? in the ancestors of humans and Neanderthals. However, the presence of this gene alone does not guarantee that Neanderthals actually spoke to each other using anything that we would classify as a language. Studies of their anatomy haven?t answered this question either: a bone in the Neanderthal throat called the hyoid resembles the human form, but the inner ear appears different. It is extremely difficult to extract nuclear DNA from such ancient samples, so the study is an impressive technical achievement. But the group cannot rule out entirely the possibility that their results are due to contamination of the samples with modern human DNA. One of the first studies of Neanderthal DNA 1 , published in  Nature  in 2006, was reanalysed this year and it was claimed that a large chunk could have been modern human DNA, not Neanderthal 2 .  \n              Of chimps and men \n            In the new study, Johannes Krause of the Max-Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany and an international team of colleagues took DNA from two Neanderthal males whose bones were found in a cave in Northern Spain.  The team then looked specifically for the sequence of a gene called  FOXP2  among the DNA from the bones ? a gene known to be related to language. It isn't clear exactly what  FOXP2  does, but in humans, mutations in this gene are known to cause a severe language problem in which affected individuals cannot grasp grammar and do not have the ability to control mouth movements to make words 3 . Krause expected to find that the Neanderthal version of the gene looked like the ?ancestral? form, as found in chimpanzees, rather than the newer human version, which differs in two places from the chimp  FOXP2 . But the human changes appeared in the Neanderthal DNA too. ?Most, including us, would have said that this gene would have looked more ancestral,? says Krause. ?The Neanderthals surprised us there a bit.? The team publish their results in  Current Biology 4 . It?s hard to say what this means for the linguistic aptitude of our Neanderthal cousins. ?The status of  FOXP2  in Neanderthals is not by itself sufficient for us to resolve the big question of whether or not they were capable of speech,? says Simon Fisher, a neuroscientist who studies  FOXP2  at the University of Oxford?s Wellcome Trust Centre for Human Genetics.  \n              Dirty bones \n            The group admits that there are other possible explanations for their results: it could be that they are sampling the offspring of Neanderthal and human mating, so that humans gave the Neanderthals in question the modern  FOXP2  gene. Or it could possibly be due to contamination in the field or the lab. Krause and his colleagues note that they took steps against contamination: they used samples from Neanderthal individuals that had been excavated in sterile conditions and immediately frozen; and they looked at several other areas of the genome where humans and Neanderthals are known to differ, to make sure that what they examined was truly the Neanderthal sequence.  But to rule it out entirely as a possibility is very difficult, says Jeffrey Wall, an evolutionary geneticist at the University of California, San Francisco, who led the reanalysis of the original  Nature  paper.  Krause is excited about what else they might find once they use their approach to look for more genes, including those related to other traits of interest such as brain size and hair colour. \n                   Genetics News \n                 \n                   Evolution and Paleontology News \n                 \n                   Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology \n                 \n                   Simon Fisher's research group \n                 Reprints and Permissions"},

About fifty million years ago, present-day India was involved in a horrific accident. The out-of-control subcontinent ploughed into Eurasia, pushing up the Himalayas and the Tibetan Plateau.  Geologists had wondered how India built up enough speed to collide with such force. Now a team of Earth scientists has come up with an explanation for India?s rapid drift. Using data from seismic stations, they were able to show that the tectonic plate on which India lies is far thinner than others around it. As a result, India was carried like a twig on the surface of the semi-fluid portion of Earth?s mantle. The results, published today in  Nature 1 , help settle a debate about the relationship between a plate?s thickness and how quickly it moves.  The story of India?s high-speed journey began more than 100 million years ago on another continent, called Gondwanaland. This continent, which lay near the present-day South Pole, was a large landmass composed of what are now Africa, Australia, Antarctica and India.  But around 130 million years ago, Gondwanaland began to drift apart. That may have been because it was being heated from below by a giant volcanic plume, says Rainer Kind, a geologist at the Free University in Berlin. Whatever the cause, it sent different parts travelling off at different speeds in different directions, he says. Antarctica remained more or less stationary, while Australia and Africa drifted slightly farther afield. But India took off for the north at an incredible speed of 20 centimetres a year, Kind says. That might seem relatively slow, but for a landmass it?s an impressive clip. In fact, Kind says, \"this is the fastest speed of a continent ever detected\".  \n              Slim and slick \n            Using data from seismic stations on all four continents and in the Pacific Ocean, Kind and his colleagues have pinned down the cause of India?s speedy departure. The team monitored a specific type of seismic wave from the boundary between the rigid lithosphere (the rocky layer beneath Earth's crust) and the viscous asthenosphere on which the lithosphere floats. By analysing waves from all the seismic stations, the team was able to determine that the Indian lithosphere extends just 100 kilometres below the surface. By contrast, Southern Africa, Australia and Antarctica all have lithospheres between 180 and 300 km thick. \"It was much easier to push India away from the centre because it was so thin,\" Kind says. The results help settle a debate about how lithospheric thickness influences a continent?s motion, says Dietmar M\u00a3ller, an Earth scientist at the University of Sydney in Australia. Previously, some scientists had speculated that a thick lithosphere might facilitate a continent?s drift across the asthenosphere in the same way that a ship?s keel helps it move through water. The new results suggest otherwise, M\u00a3ller says.  But a mystery remains: why was India?s crust so much thinner than the rest? Kind and colleagues claim that the same hot volcanic plume that broke up Gondwanaland might also have thinned India?s lithosphere.

Scientists in Shenzhen announced yesterday that they have sequenced the diploid genome of a Han Chinese individual. The announcement comes on the heels of the completion of Craig Venter?s 1  and James Watson?s personal genomes earlier this year. ?Everyone will get their own genome sequenced in the near future, for better health care. We are very excited because this accomplishment got us closer to that goal,? a scientist from the Beijing Genomics Institute said in a press release. Although humans share most of their genome with one another, slight genetic differences may correspond to variation in their susceptibility to diseases and responses to therapeutics. Han Chinese represent 92% of China?s population and are the largest ethnic group in the world. People in the same ethnic groups can share genetic characteristics that may be useful for targeting future drug treatments. ?We certainly know there is a lot of genetic variation, and it is not distributed uniformly around the world,? says Kenneth Kidd, a population geneticist at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut, who is one of the founders of the Human Genome Diversity Project. ?The difference between Jim Watson and Craig Venter was fairly illuminating.?  \n              One, two, three \n            The technical details of the Beijing group?s research have not yet been released, but as the first Asian genome sequenced, scientists are already heralding it as a promising advance. ?We?re seeing three genomes sequenced this year,? says Thomas Hudson, a geneticist at the Ontario Institute for Cancer Research in Toronto, ?it?s a very important step.? Hudson led the effort to generate a gene map of the human genome at the Whitehead Institute in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and visited the Beijing Genomics Institute in 2005 as part of a collaboration on the International HapMap Project. He found the Beijing group to be very keen, he says. ?They?re very eager to partake in modern science and show that they have a capable group.?

The Human Genome Project, which was completed four years ago, cost US$3 billion over 13 years. James Watson?s genome was completed in June in just two months for less than $1 million. ?That $1,000 genome which people have been talking about,? says Hudson, ?we?re getting there.?  The Beijing group plans to sequence more individuals in the Asian population so that they can begin to correlate genetic variation with underlying disease.

World Health Organization (WHO) officials have stressed the need for Nigeria to continue its polio vaccination programme, despite an outbreak that has been linked directly to the live virus strain contained within the vaccine used in that country. The outbreak has reportedly paralysed 69 children in the north of the country. But officials stress that vaccination remains essential. They are worried that the incident could spark a scare that will see uptake rates, which have been climbing steadily since 2004, tailing off once more. \"We are concerned,\" admits Oliver Rosenbauer of the WHO's Polio Eradication Initiative, based in Geneva, Switzerland.  Nigeria is one of only four countries ? alongside India, Pakistan and Afghanistan ? where polio is still endemic. Many other countries, where polio is under control, have switched to an inactivated form of the virus, delivered as an injection rather than orally. The live oral vaccine is not only cheaper, but actually better suited to controlling polio in regions where the wild virus is still present, says Rosenbauer.  \n              Live is best \n            The oral vaccine works because the ingestion of live virus mimics the natural process of infection, encouraging the production of antibodies in the gut. This means that recently vaccinated people excrete live virus particles from the vaccine; but it is a less-dangerous strain of the virus. The spread of virus particles this way can encourage 'passive immunity', in which people who have not been vaccinated nevertheless develop some immunity by coming into contact with the vaccine strain. \"99.9% of the time it's an added benefit for us,\" Rosenbauer says.  However, if there are lots of unvaccinated people in the population, they can pass on this strain until it happens to mutate back into a disease-causing form, as happened in Nigeria. It is thought to take about a year for this mutation to happen. This is rare, Rosenbauer stresses ? some 10 billion doses of oral polio vaccine have been administered worldwide, and it has only been directly implicated in 9 outbreaks, accounting for fewer than 200 cases of disease.  \n              Bad luck \n            \"It's incredibly bad luck that this has happened in Nigeria, especially given that [this country] has made such progress.\" From 2003?2004, Nigerian authorities suspended the polio programme, after the vaccine was denounced by religious leaders. Average immunization rates among the population dropped to around 30%; today they have bounced back to around 75%, the WHO reports. Rosenbauer says that the 2003-2004 hiatus in the vaccination programme was a crucial causal factor in the current outbreak. The WHO is working with partners such as UNICEF to encourage people to vaccinate their children. \"In 2004 after vaccinations resumed there was a lot of suspicion, so there has been a lot of work to breed confidence,\" Rosenbauer says. \"That will now need to continue in light of what's happened.\"  \n              Making a switch \n            The WHO is currently sponsoring a switch to the inactivated injectable vaccine in countries where polio has been brought under control, such as Mexico and Indonesia. Most Western countries have made a similar switch in the past decade. The injectable vaccine protects the blood and nervous system, but does not promote antibody production in the gut. This means vaccinated people can become carriers of the wild disease and pass it on to others through faecal contamination, even though their jab prevents them from becoming sick. So the live vaccine is still viewed as the best option in areas where the wild virus is rife. \n                   Health and medicine \n                 \n                   World Health Organization \n                 \n                   Global Polio Eradication Initiative \n                 Reprints and Permissions"},

Cane toads rampaging across Australia have for years been portrayed as an unstoppable invasive force of super-amphibians. But it seems their march across the country is costing them dearly ? it is making the invaders prone to arthritis. The findings hint that invading animals may be more vulnerable to infections designed to stop their spread. Cane toads ( Bufo marinus ) were introduced into northeastern Australia in 1935 to control crop-eating insects. But they spread quickly, and have been blamed for declines in native animals in colonized areas. Today, ecologists and farmers are doing their best to keep the invading hoards from expanding any further. Now Rick Shine and his colleagues have found that toads at the front of the invading population are suffering arthritis as a result of their fast-hopping travels ?>. This is likely to be a big shake-up to those studying invasive species: the idea that an introduced animal capable of establishing itself and decimating local wildlife is nonetheless under severe stress is a novel one. \"In my experience this is a totally unprecedented observation,\" says Dave Skelly, an amphibian expert at Yale University in Connecticut. \"Thinking about the costs of invasions is something that deserves our attention. This is going to change how researchers in the field think about their systems.\"  \n              Long legged \n            Shine, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Sydney, Australia, had previously shown that toads at the invasion front tend to have longer legs than those trailing behind, allowing them to conquer more territory more quickly.  While conducting this research, Shine had also noticed a high number of spinal abnormalities in the advancing cane toads. By examining preserved specimens taken from invading and established toad populations, Shine's group found that about 10% of large invading adults had severe spinal arthritis ? which in toads manifests as bony growths fusing the joints between vertebrae. And by looking at live populations, Shine and his colleagues determined that the faster, larger toads were more likely to have arthritis, they report in the  Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences  ?>.  Cultures from affected joints point the finger of blame at  Ochrobactrum anthropi , a usually harmless and common soil bacteria that seems to be infecting toads made vulnerable by the stress of travel. \"Basically, the body plan of frogs [and hence toads] has evolved to support a fairly sedentary lifestyle: sit beside the swamp, catch bugs, et cetera,\" says Shine. \"The invasion process has put very different pressures onto cane toads, and has resulted in the evolution of an animal that, based on radiotracking, moves long distances and does so every night.\" This gives the toads access to more food, but isn't doing their joints any favours.  \n              Racing invalids \n            To see whether arthritis hinders the toads' invasion, Shine raced arthritic toads against healthy ones. On a 10-metre runway, the arthritic toads quickly slowed down compared with their healthy brethren. However, when toads were fitted with radio transmitters and released into the wild, the arthritic toads seemed to move just as far as the healthy critters. \"Toads are incredibly stoic animals,\" says Shine. \"We confidently expected that the arthritic toads would travel less far under field conditions than same-sized non-afflicted toads. Instead, the arthritic toads simply keep on going. They can?t keep moving rapidly for long distances, and are forced to take shorter hops. But they keep going nonetheless.\" But the work could still lead to ways to control the toads.  Shine has been investigating the possibility of using lungworm parasites, which are known to kill some toads, to control the advancing hoards. The new research suggests that invasion-front toads have weakened immune systems, so they may be particularly vulnerable to such parasites. \"The toads may be vulnerable to other immune challenges,\" says Shine. \"The high levels of stress they experience may well prove an Achilles' heel that we can exploit to help control these troublesome invaders.\" \n                   Invasion and the evolution of speed in toads \n                 Reprints and Permissions"},

A survey of Alzheimer?s patients has identified some distinctive proteins in the blood that could be used to diagnose the disease more effectively. Earlier and more definitive diagnoses are wanted to help target treatments ? both existing and experimental. More than 5 million North Americans currently have Alzheimer?s disease. It is estimated that about quarter of a million developing cases go undiagnosed every year. Doctors can diagnose Alzheimer?s only by eliminating other possible causes of mental decline. There is no definitive test for the disease until a person dies, when surgeons can examine his or her brain tissue to look for the protein plaques and tangles that are the hallmark of the disease. Researchers are trying to change that situation by finding biomarkers ? definitive biological signatures of the disease. Today, a team led by neuroscientist Tony Wyss-Coray of Stanford University School of Medicine in California reports in  Nature Medicine 1  the discovery of 18 proteins that together seem fairly diagnostic for the condition.  If the biomarkers are confirmed by more rigorous testing, they could result in a simple blood test by which doctors could diagnose the disease. Sufferers could then take medications to delay the effects of Alzheimer?s, plan to change their finances or living situation, or enroll in clinical trials to test potential new drugs.  \n              The communicode \n            Wyss-Coray?s team examined proteins in 259 blood samples from people with and without Alzheimer?s disease. The researchers looked at 120 proteins that cells use to communicate with each other ? a set of proteins they dubbed the 'communicode'. The idea was that changes to such proteins in brain cells affected by Alzheimer?s might leach into the blood system. ?The idea was to look at factors in the blood that could tell us whether there is a disease process going on in the brain or not,? Wyss-Coray says. A set of 18 of these communication proteins occurred at different levels in the blood of people with and without Alzheimer?s disease, they found. Researchers then looked at levels of these proteins in 20 patients whose Alzheimer?s or non-Alzheimer?s status had been determined by other doctors. The researchers did not know which samples related to which patients. The protein diagnosis agreed with the doctors? assessments for 18 of the 20; in one case, doctors made an Alzheimer?s diagnosis that the proteins did not flag, and in another the proteins indicated Alzheimer?s where the doctors did not agree.  The work was supported by two Alzheimer?s foundations, the US National Institute on Aging and a biotechnology company in Redwood City, California, called Satoris. Wyss-Coray is a paid consultant for Satoris and a founder of the company, which also employs two more of the study?s 25 authors.   \n              Best observation \n            Other scientists are investigating alternative possible diagnostics for Alzheimer?s. Some are using high-powered imaging studies to examine people?s brains to look for characteristic plaques and tangles while they are still alive. Others have found that proteins from these plaques can be detected in the cerebrospinal fluid, which surrounds the spinal cord and can be accessed through a spinal tap. But, Wyss-Coray says, many studies are beginning to support the idea that a biomarker outside the brain could allow earlier and easier diagnosis. Examining blood is easier and potentially cheaper than using spinal taps or imaging. Although there is no cure for Alzheimer?s, Wyss-Coray says it could still help patients to know they are affected. \n                   Nature Insight on Aging \n                 \n                   Alzheimer?s Association  \n                 Reprints and Permissions"},

By exploiting millions of hours of computing time donated by the users of 150,000 home computers, scientists have predicted the structure of a protein using just its sequence of amino acids. The project marks a significant advance in a field that's been flush with hope yet short on tangible results, experts say. Determining the shape of a protein is normally a matter of firing X-ray beams at its crystalline form and measuring their diffraction, and protein chemists have long been sceptical of attempts to replace this practice with modelling or theory. \"Modelling right now has a terrible name in the field,\" says Michael Levitt, a computational biologist at Stanford University. But in a Nature paper published online on 14 October, David Baker, a biochemist at the University of Washington in Seattle, and his colleagues report results that may do much to dispel that scepticism (B. Qian  et al.   Nature  doi:10.1038/nature06249; 2007). A protein's shape ? and therefore its activity ? is determined by the precise way its constituent string of amino acids folds up. \"If you think of the whole thing as like an utterly flexible snake, there are hundreds of degrees of freedom at every site,\" says Eleanor Dodson, a structural biologist at the University of York, UK. The final shape depends on the molecular interactions each amino acid has with its neighbours, with surrounding water molecules and with other amino acids that are a long distance away in terms of sequence, but which become close as a result of folding. It's a horrendous problem to model. Rather than trying to solve the problem from first principles, Baker's technique combines information from the sum of what is already known about protein structures with the vast computing power available through the Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing. This software, developed at the University of California, Berkeley, allows people to contribute spare computing power on their desktops to scientific projects (most famously, the search for extraterrestrial intelligence, in the form of SETI@home); 150,000 volunteers used it to download a copy of the Baker lab's Rosetta@home program.  Rosetta breaks a protein's sequence into short stretches that can be matched to identical stretches from proteins with known structures. These shapes offer many ways to sew the protein under study back together, and the program chooses those that minimize the free energy of the structure (a measure of its stability). By running the program over and over again on thousands of computers, the researchers lurched towards an ever more accurate protein model. When fed the sequence of T0283, a 112-amino-acid protein from a bacterium, the network spat out several million structures after a million hours of computing time. Those millions were whittled down to five by further repeated computer analysis, and one of the structures was spot on, correlating with the structure as determined from its crystal.  Although the structure's precision was not on a par with high-resolution crystal models, it was good enough for researchers to think that the technique could simplify the process of obtaining X-ray structures in the future. To turn X-ray patterns into structures, researchers must produce patterns from crystals that have either been spiked with heavy-metal 'markers' or come with some indication of what the final structure will look like, for example from the shape of a related protein. Rosetta's structure for T0283 was good enough to function in this way. The program should now be able to provide such reference points for proteins for which there are already X-ray data, but which lack useful relatives and whose structures thus languish unsolved. \"You will be able to solve a whole bunch of these structures rather quickly,\" says Adrian Roitberg, a protein modeller at the University of Florida in Gainesville. There is still room for improvement, though, says Rhiju Das, a postdoc working on the Rosetta@home project and a co-author on Baker's paper. Each home computer works in isolation, he explains. If the program could be rewritten to run on the many parallel processors in a supercomputer, Rosetta might become considerably more powerful.   One pay-off of better structure prediction would be the prospect of custom-made proteins, says Baker, who uses Rosetta to hunt for sequences that correspond to desired structures. His lab and that of University of Washington biochemist Bill Schief are currently working on redesigning the gp120 protein of HIV to make a vaccine that could stimulate the immune system in a different way from the natural virus. The reshaped protein should elicit antibodies that attack the virus more effectively than antibodies created after infection. The days when protein modellers thought they could make crystallization obsolete are long gone, Baker adds. But melding the two techniques could offer biologists insight into many more proteins ? and faster. \"If you really care about the structure of your protein, you should get some experimental data and combine it with modelling,\" he says. \n                     Rosetta@home \n                   \n                     CASP \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Men have it tough: they age faster and die younger than women. Now research suggests that this trait could be linked to humankind?s ancestral breeding habits. Several explanations have been proposed for the lifespan difference between men and women. It could be a result of the ageing effects of testosterone. Or it could be thanks to evolutionary forces: having the men die early might ease pressure on valuable resources, for example, helping the overall success of the species. Or perhaps it has something to do with mating behaviour. Casual observations had previously suggested that polygyny is a common characteristic among species in which males die younger than females, including red deer, lions and elephant seals. In more monogamous species, including Bewick?s swans and meerkats, a gender-related lifespan difference is not seen. So Tim Clutton-Brock and Kavita Isvaran of Cambridge University pulled together data sets in which measures of survival and descriptions of breeding were available for both sexes, to see whether this observation holds true.  In monogamous species, they found no consistent sex differences in breeding lifespans, annual rates of mortality or rates of ageing. But the more polygynous a species was, the more short-lived the male was likely to be, and the shorter their duration of effective breeding, the team reports in  Proceedings of the Royal Society of London B 1 .  In polygynous red deer, for example, males live 75% as long as females, and have an effective breeding period of less than half that of the females. In swans, which almost always pair for life (with only a 6% divorce rate), lifespans and effective breeding periods are nearly equal. (See )  \n              Fight for it \n            The researchers suggest that this could be because in species in which males fight for mates, evolution favours the development of characteristics that help win fights (such as aggression or antler growth) at the expense of male longevity. ?We need more long-term studies following individual animals through their lifespan to understand this better,? says Clutton-Brock. ?The results can be simplified as fight hard, and not only die young but evolve to die young,? says Stephen Stearns of Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut.  It?s unclear to what extent this work might be relevant to people. But previous research has shown in primates and humans that increased testosterone levels downregulate the immune system to allow scarce resources to be diverted into things such as muscle mass, which are useful in mating competitions. ?Those results can be simplified as: macho makes you sick. This is the kind of message that everyone can appreciate and should make some reflect on their chosen lifestyle,? adds Stearns.   In the past, many ageing studies were done on model organisms such as fruitflies and mice in the lab, Stearns adds. ?It is delightful to see those insights now applied to organisms in their natural habitat.? ?What I?d like to see next are similar studies of species where reproductive competition is more intense in females than in males, like the sand-piper and a few species of pipefish,? adds Clutton-Brock. \n                   CDC: Healthy Aging  \n                 \n                   National Institute on Aging  \n                 Reprints and Permissions"},

Decades of breeding high-yielding soya-beans in fertilized soils has produced varieties that have lost the ability to interact effectively with soil bacteria, researchers have found. The results suggest that modern breeds of soya beans, and possibly other crops, may now be less suited for growth in low-nutrient conditions, such as the unfertilized fields of developing countries. ?I would say it?s worrying,? says Ford Denison, a plant ecologist at the University of Minnesota in St Paul and a co-author on the study. ?It?s something that I would like plant breeders to recognize.? Soya beans do not typically require fertilizer because they live together with soil bacteria that ?fix? atmospheric nitrogen into more useful forms, such as ammonium, that can be used by the plant. In exchange, the plants provide carbon to the bacteria. But fixing nitrogen is costly, and not all bacteria put much effort into the process. Soils contain some strains of bacterial 'swindlers', which live off plant roots without giving much nitrogen in return.  Previous research has shown that soya beans tend to fight back against such swindlers, providing less carbon to cheaters and extra carbon to the more generous bacteria. This encourages the growth of beneficial bacteria 1 .  Modern agricultural practices, however, have partially relieved soya beans from having to fight this battle. Although the plants are not directly fertilized, residual fertilizer is often left in the soil after rotating other crops through the same field. And farmers sometimes inoculate soya bean seeds with strains of nitrogen-fixing bacteria that are particularly adept at fixing nitrogen.  \n              Lost talent \n            Toby Kiers, now at VU University in Amsterdam, and her colleagues wondered whether these conditions might have affected the ability of soya beans to distinguish helpful bacteria from cheaters. The researchers gathered six soya bean variants from throughout 60 years of crop breeding history, and grew them in unfertilized fields. They tested the soya beans by providing them with mixtures of bacteria containing good nitrogen fixers and closely related bacteria that couldn?t fix nitrogen at all.  Seed production in the more modern breeds of soya bean declined more than in older breeds when cheating bacteria were present, suggesting that older breeds are able to cope better with the presence of such cheaters, they found 2 . The results are published this week in the  Proceedings of the Royal Society Lond. ?The difference between old and new was enough to eliminate the yield benefit of all of these decades of breeding,? says Denison. Plant breeders may not have detected the decline in performance, he notes, because fertilized soils and inoculation with robust nitrogen-fixers may have masked the trait. Alternatively, other benefits of the new breeds, such as disease resistance, may have outweighed the detriments of reduced bacterial selection in some regions, he adds. Nevertheless, those bacterial relationships are important in non-fertilized soils, as is often found in developing nations. Soils also vary in the quality of their nitrogen-fixing bacteria, and some regions have a high proportion of ?cheaters?. Under these conditions, the ability of soya beans to direct their efforts to rewarding bacteria is probably more important.  \n              Important partners \n            Breeders can now cross new, higher-yielding breeds with old varieties to try to recoup the ability to cope with cheating bacteria, notes Tim Crews, an ecologist at Prescott College in Arizona, who was not involved with the work.  The results provide a reminder that breeders should consider ecological relationships when they select their crops and breed for high performance, says Crews. ?Modern plant breeding has allowed this trait to slip through the cracks,? he says.  Previous research has suggested that interactions of some crops, including wheat, corn and soya beans, with certain soil fungi may also have become less beneficial over time. This could be a consequence of using fertilizers in breeding programmes, notes Denison. ?It raises the question in my mind: what else are we missing?? says Crews. ?We could be doing a lot more with a lot less.? \n                   Nature Insights: Food and the Future  \n                 \n                   Web Focus: Plant-microbe interactions \n                 \n                   R.

Zebrafish don't nap more during daylight hours when sleep deprived, a new study shows. The work suggests that fish are better able to use light cues to stay awake during the day than mammals, hinting that evolution has produced different systems for regulating sleep in different groups of animals. Every animal sleeps, but many do so in ways that humans would hardly recognize. Cows stand stock still on their four legs; dolphins take a separate nap in each hemisphere of their brains so they can keep swimming. Even fruitflies catch forty winks now and again in their short lives.   The way you can tell a zebrafish is asleep, says Emmanuel Mignot at Stanford University in Palo Alto, California, is that its tail droops, it hangs immobile at the bottom of the tank, and it requires more of a prod ? a mild electric current will do ? to get it swimming than when it is awake.  Mignot and his colleagues are keen to keep zebrafish awake to study how sleep ? or the lack of it ? affects this often-studied fish. No one really understands why people sleep; how sleep evolved is equally mysterious, says Mignot. \"Sleep is one of the basic mysteries remaining, in terms of why it has been selected for.\" To understand that, he is studying sleep in animals from dogs to zebrafish. \"It is better to understand how we sleep across evolution, and then we will understand the reason for sleep,\" he says.   \n              Dodging the sleep debt \n            The team found that if you keep zebrafish awake all night and then leave the lights off, they will make up for lost snoozing time. But if you keep them awake and then flip on the lights, they won't nap more during the next day, as mammals would 1 .  To find out what was causing this behaviour, Mignot and his colleagues looked at what happens when a mutation knocks out the only receptor for the sleep neuropeptide hypocretin (also known as orexin) in the zebrafish. In mammals, such a gap in the hypocretin system causes narcolepsy, a syndrome featuring crushing daytime sleepiness and night-time insomnia as well as bouts of muscle collapse called cataplexy. But in the fish, this seems to cause only the night-time insomnia. Mignot says he thinks that light and the hormone it triggers ? melatonin ? suppress sleep in the fish so strongly, they overrule any 'sleep debt' from the night before. Unlike mammals, they only need their hypocretin system to regulate sleep at night. Physiological studies support this theory. Some birds seem to behave the same way, Mignot adds, hinting that light and melatonin-dominated day regulation might span the non-mammalian animal family tree.  \"I do believe the role of light and melatonin came to a kind of crossroads. At some point it became less effective, and animals had to develop a different way to promote wakefulness,\" says Mignot. The finding contradicts previous work that has found that hypocretin increases wakefulness during the day as well as at night in zebrafish ? though this was in larvae rather than adults 2 . \"Further analysis of hypocretin-receptor mutants is needed to resolve these discrepancies,\" says Alexander Schier of Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, one of the authors of the previous study.   \n              Drowsy dogs \n             Mignot has been mapping the neurochemistry of sleep in humans, rodents, and a pack of narcoleptic dogs for years.

He's going to stick with his zebrafish for now, he adds, but he would love to study the same system in an animal such as a platypus ? from the most ancient and reptile-like family of mammals. \"I would dream to do this in a monotreme, to find out if we could have a narcoleptic platypus.\" The narcoleptic dogs, incidentally, are no longer an active area of research ? the dogs have all been retired into private life. \"We have one last dog, and he was just adopted,\" says Mignot. \"He's now mine.\" \n                   Free Association, The Nature Genetics blog  \n                 \n                   Nature insight on sleep \n                 \n                   Mignot's lab \n                 \n                   HHMI Magazine article about Mignot?s dogs \n                 Reprints and Permissions"},

Erika Check Hayden looks at what they might reveal in the future. In his 2000 State of the Union Address, President Bill Clinton chose to emphasize something he had recently heard from a genome researcher: that humans are all, irrespective of race, 99.9% the same genetically. \"Modern science,\" he told his country's legislators, \"has confirmed what ancient faiths have always taught: the most important fact of life is our common humanity.\" Seven years on, and four years after the final publication of the sequences from the Human Genome Project, new technologies and larger data sets are allowing genome biologists to answer a conundrum embodied in that unity-inspiring percentage: if our DNA is so similar, why do we seem different in so many ways? The answer, in part, is that the genome is not as uniform as Clinton was led to believe; nor is it nearly as sedate, stable and homogeneous as scientists used to think. It's less a 'Book of Life', more a wiki; many of its ho-hum elements don't change, but some really interesting bits are constantly revised. \"Maybe 99% of our genome behaves in a nice, predictable way,\" says Gilean McVean, a statistical geneticist at the University of Oxford, UK. \"But it's become clear that there is this pool of errant variants that are responsible for a lot of the dynamism in our genome, and we don't understand its consequences for disease risk or normal variation.\" Over the past year, two large studies 1 ,   2  have found evidence that many people carry around lots of large chunks of DNA that are deleted, copied, flipped or otherwise rearranged in other people. The findings confirm earlier studies that hinted at this type of 'structural' variation but were not large enough to command assent 3 . A study of the genome of sequencing pioneer Craig Venter also found much more variation from reference sequences than expected 4 . The larger analyses estimate that such variable regions could make up more than 10% of the genome, vindicating scientists, such as Evan Eichler of the University of Washington in Seattle, who have long argued that structural variation is a major source of diversity. Scientists are still investigating how much it contributes to differences between populations. But it is already clearly linked to some differences between individuals that can be correlated with behaviour or environment. For example, a study published in September reported 5  that evolution has driven a starch-digestion gene to duplicate itself in people with traditionally starch-heavy diets. \"We're getting away from this 0.1% figure that has been in our minds ever since the draft human genome sequence came out,\" says Hunt Willard, head of the Institute for Genome Sciences and Policy at Duke University Medical Center in Durham, North Carolina. \"We're now looking at maybe half a per cent of content that is unique to individual genomes.\" The actual variation is thus lower than the extent of the variable regions, but larger than previously thought. \"Maybe Eichler always had that number in his head,\" adds Willard, \"but no one else did.\" That said, Willard points out that population geneticists such as Luca Cavalli-Sforza and Richard Lewontin arrived at a similar figure in pioneering studies linking protein and gene diversity to the history of human populations. What's different today is the scale and type of data available. The HapMap, a catalogue of the variation seen in 270 people from America, Japan, China and West Africa, is a case in point. Today, McVean and a cast of hundreds publish a second-generation analysis of the HapMap (see page  851 ), the first phase of which was published in 2005 (ref.  6 ). The new, more thorough version finds surprisingly high diversity in single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) \u2014 parts of the genome marked out by specific changes in a single DNA base pair. The HapMap uses SNPs to identify chunks of DNA that tend to stay the same within populations. Researchers can then create an ordered list of SNPs, and thus DNA chunks, for each chromosome and choose one 'tag SNP' to stand in for the many SNPs that travel together on each chunk. But in the updated HapMap, 1% of the more than 3 million SNPs that have now been analysed cannot be grouped with their neighbours to mark identical chunks of DNA. These 'untaggable SNPs' reveal parts of the genome that vary greatly between people. \"These untaggable SNPs are completely doing their own thing,\" McVean says. \"It's not a high percentage of SNPs, but it's still a lot of them.\"  \n                Branching out \n              Scientists are now obtaining DNA from seven more populations with African, Asian and European ancestry that could help explain the origin of the mystery SNPs. They are also discussing a massive new bout of sequencing in an international project involving Chinese, British and US funders that would use new technologies to sequence the genomes of 1,000 individuals. Along with the two individual genome sequences already released 4 , these data will fuel a field that is set to explode over the next year: the hunt for genetic signatures that discriminate between smaller and smaller groups. \"The HapMap data can clearly tell you whether you are African or Chinese, but the question becomes, how far can you take that?\" asks population geneticist Carlos Bustamante from Cornell University in Ithaca, New York. \"Can you predict whether somebody comes from one village or another? We are going to see all kinds of stuff we would never have imagined was possible.\" But does this just amount to expensive, and possibly divisive, genealogy? Pardis Sabeti at the Broad Institute in Cambridge, Massachusetts, thinks not. Today, she publishes an extensive study that uses the HapMap to identify specific genes linked to human diversity (see page  913 ). Over the past three years, Sabeti and other scientists have performed a series of studies finding evidence for 'positive selection' in chunks of DNA that differ between populations \u2014 indicating that genes are evolving differently in people from different parts of the world. Sabeti now reports that she has pinpointed specific genes that seem to be responsible for some of the positive selection affecting these chunks. For instance, she found that variants of two genes linked to infection with the Lassa virus are favoured in West Africans. Sabeti hopes that such studies will help guide scientists towards biological pathways involved in such regionally specific diseases. But her work also raises the sensitive issue of the biological meaning and relevance of race. Variants peculiar to Asian populations in another pair of genes \u2014 linked to hair, teeth and sweat glands \u2014 have no obvious links to disease. And there is the possibility that such population-specific variations might lead in uncomfortable directions. In 2005, for instance, geneticist Bruce Lahn from the University of Chicago in Illinois suggested that two genes linked to brain size had evolved rapidly in groups that migrated out of Africa tens of thousands of years ago 7 , 8 . His results prompted criticism among fellow scientists, who felt that he didn't have the proper evidence to back such an incendiary claim. Sabeti notes with relief that Lahn's genes haven't turned up in any genome-wide scan so far \u2014 another sign that his conclusions were unfounded. Lahn says that true tests of his work are beyond the scope of these approaches, and that he is using other methods, including resequencing parts of the genome, to bolster his conclusions. \"This is a very delicate time, and a dangerous time, as people start to come up with things that the general public, or the media, or various groups might misinterpret,\" Sabeti says. \"I like the fact that, so far, the evidence we find for natural selection in humans is only skin deep.\" See  http://tinyurl.com/3xw89t  for an interview with Luca Cavalli-Sforza about his Italian Genome Project and geographic genetic diversity.

On 8 - 10 October, Rahmstorf, along with more than a dozen Nobel laureates and many others, was at a symposium in Potsdam discussing climate change and related problems under the rubric ?Global sustainability: a Nobel cause?. On 12 October he and they heard that the Nobel Peace Prize had been awarded to Al Gore, moviemaker and former US vice-president, and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) ? their cause had a Nobel prize of its own. ?Al Gore is a tireless fighter for the cause of climate who thoroughly deserves the prize for bringing this serious issue to the attention of politicians and the public,? says Robert Watson, one of the Potsdam participants and a former IPCC chairman. ?But I am incredibly pleasantly surprised that the IPCC will share the prize, which justly rewards the whole climate research community.? Rajendra Pachauri, current chairman of the IPCC, also sees the prize as recognition of a global achievement. ?I would like to pay tribute to the scientific community, who are the winners of this award,? he says. As climate change is ultimately a threat to peace and security, the Nobel Peace Prize is a totally appropriate reward for the IPCC?s work, Watson adds. The prize has been given for environmental work before. In 2004 it went to Kenyan biologist and environmentalist Wangari Muta Maathai ? who delivered a speech to the Potsdam meeting via live video from Nairobi ? for initiating the ?Green Belt Movement? in Africa.  The IPCC has issued four assessment reports over the past two decades. Each is an extensive compendium of the available scientific literature on the science and effects of climate change, the result of work by thousands of authors and reviewers. ?I can tell you a thing or two about sifting through piles and piles of reviews on evenings and weekends,? says Rahmstorf, a lead author for the most recent assessment on the physical science behind climate change. Discussions have recently begun on how to make information compiled by the IPCC more useful and relevant to policy-makers. Pachauri has drafted and disseminated notes listing several options, one being to issue shorter, more targeted and more frequent reports on special issues. Another possibility is to focus increasingly on the regional impacts of climate change. These and other options will be discussed at a series of meetings in the coming months. ?We may have to modify the IPCC to make it more efficient,? says Watson. ?But the Nobel prize just reminds us that we need to continue.? Environmental advocates and many US scientists lauded Gore?s efforts to bring climate science to a global audience, which began more than two decades ago and most recently took the form of the documentary film  An Inconvenient Truth . Michael MacCracken, chief scientist for climate-change programmes at the Climate Institute in Washington DC, acknowledges that Gore was unable to move the United States towards action when he was vice-president under Bill Clinton in the 1990s, but says that since then Gore has been enormously successful in spreading the word. ?It?s been really hard to capture public attention,? he says, ?and I think that is what Gore has really done.?  Susan Solomon, a senior scientist with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and co-chair of the IPCC?s first working group, calls the prize a ?wonderful victory for science? and credits Gore with delivering the message to the public. ?I love the movie. I really do,? Solomon says. ?I think his goal is to make people aware, and I think that is a very good goal. I don?t think he has tried to promote a political agenda.? Dan Schrag, a geochemist at Harvard University, while agreeing that the prize for Gore was well deserved, is not so sanguine about the politics. ?The only concern I have ? is that Gore has helped make the climate issue a partisan issue in the United States, and that is not true in other parts of the world.?  Predictably, the prize has increased speculation that Gore will make another run for the White House, a possibility that Gore has repeatedly played down but never entirely ruled out. \n                   Climate change news \n                 \n                   Nature Reports climate change \n                 \n                   Nobel Prize Foundation \n                 \n                   IPCC \n                 \n                   Al Gore's Climate Crisis page \n                 Reprints and Permissions"},

Collectors have long been fascinated by the colours and patterns of bird eggs. Now research has shown that these marks of beauty can also function as indicators of toxic chemicals. Evidence has been mounting this year that egg markings are connected to the health of the birds that lay them. Studies have shown that egg speckling intensifies when mothers are calcium deficient, and that eggs develop a blue-green hue when maternal immune-system strength is compromised. These discoveries led Andrew Gosler at the University of Oxford and a team of biologists to analyse eggs exposed to DDT (dichloro-diphenyl-trichloroethane). DDT was discovered to be an effective insecticide during the Second World War, with the capacity to save lives by killing disease-transmitting insects. Later, it was used in agriculture until it was found to be an environmental hazard. In 1972, DDT was banned in the United States. One of the problems created by the chemical was the thinning of bird eggshells, causing cracking and reproductive failure. Bald eagles, peregrine falcons, California condors and many other species were brought near to extinction.  Gosler was curious whether eggs laid by DDT-contaminated birds showed signs of poor maternal health in their colouration. He expected to see both increased speckling and green hues, because DDT is linked to reduced calcium and immune-system damage. The study analysed 49 sparrow hawk eggs, collected from abandoned nests around the United Kingdom in 1996, all of which had been previously tested for DDT contamination. These tests revealed a range of chemical concentrations from 10 to 300 parts per million (p.p.m.) by volume, suggesting either continued illegal use of DDT in some areas or a worrying environmental persistence of the insecticide. Previous studies have indicated that a concentration of more than 200 p.p.m. causes shells to become brittle.  \n              Toxic load \n            The researchers report in the  Journal of Applied Ecology 1  a strong positive relationship between speckling intensity, green hue and DDT. Other toxins, such as mercury, are not expected to affect calcium and in fact did not affect speckling; they didn?t seem to affect the egg colour either, which surprised the researchers. Gosler?s team later compared their sample to eggs laid before 1930. ?We were stunned by the difference between healthy and contaminated eggs. I would never have noticed it before, but once we knew what we were looking for it was right there in front of our eyes,? comments Gosler. The research comes at an opportune time. With increasing malaria resistance, the World Health Organisation (WHO) has endorsed DDT use indoors in areas where the disease has reached epidemic proportions. Although this is vital to stem the tide of malaria, it has many conservationists concerned. ?We have no idea how much DDT is getting into waste water or whether it is being used outdoors regardless of the WHO recommendations, but as long as DDT is around we need to monitor ecosystems nearby,? comments Rick Watson, director of international programmes at the World Center for Birds of Prey in Boise, Idaho.  Normally the only way to test for the presence of DDT is to monitor shell thickness and run chemical tests. This is particularly difficult because egg fragments don?t last long in the wild where they are eaten for calcium or quickly dispersed. ?If the colour of an egg can really be used instead of these tests, it would make pesticide monitoring a whole lot easier,? adds Watson. Gosler is attempting to develop a quantitative test for DDT based on these visual factors, and hopes that software might be developed to analyse digital photos in future. \n                   The world center for birds of prey \n                 \n                   World Health Organisation ?

Next time you whisper sweet nothings to the object of your affections as they peacefully doze off, don't be surprised if they can't remember a word of it the next morning. Neuroscientists have shown that the brain's pathways for deciphering speech, and forming memories of it, switch off as anaesthetized patients begin to nod off. They suspect the same holds true for normal, non-drug-induced sleep. Researchers led by Matt Davis of the Medical Research Council Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit in Cambridge, UK, studied 12 volunteers under the influence of varying amounts of an anaesthetic called propofol, which induced varying levels of drowsiness. They played them recordings of speech or other sounds, and monitored their brains using a technique called functional magnetic resonance imaging. The volunteers' brains were more active in response to speech than to generic noise, suggesting that they still recognised spoken words. But the part of the brain involved with the more subtle job of untangling words that can have alternative meanings depending on context or spelling (such as 'bark', or 'pear/pair') showed no activity in the drowsiest volunteers. Neither did the part involved with forming memories of speech.  This suggests that the brain simply shuts down higher-level aspects of speech recognition as sleep starts to set in, making it hard to remember or understand what was said in the moments before sleep. The results appear in the journal  Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 1 . The results also show that speech comprehension can suffer even when only lightly sedated, or when slightly sleepy, says anaesthetist David Menon of the University of Cambridge, who also worked on the study. This, he adds, would explain why \"when you're falling asleep when your wife is telling you something, sometimes you don't remember it\". \n              Asleep or awake \n            Menon and his colleagues hope that this type of work might one day help them to discover more about the degree of awareness experienced by patients in operating theatres.  Data on how many people are aware of, or have memories of, their operations, are sketchy. But the overall figure is estimated at as much as 0.2% of patients. That incidence may be even higher in certain procedures in which anaesthetists err on the side of caution and administer less anaesthetic, such as caesarian sections, heart surgeries and operations on elderly people.  So researchers are keen for improved methods for gauging the level of awareness among people under anaesthetic. \"We don't want to overdose but we want to provide a measure of how much is 'enough' anaesthetic,\" Menon says.  \n              Mind readers \n            Menon admits that it is difficult to know, simply by scanning the brain, exactly what the patient is experiencing. But he hopes that more studies of lightly sedated healthy volunteers will yield accurate descriptions of their cognitive experience to go with their brain readings. \"This has to be seen as a first step, where we try and calibrate brain responses,\" Menon says. He notes that because memory seems to be impaired before other functions relating to awareness, patients may be aware of their operations but have no explicit memories of them afterwards. This could potentially lead to post-traumatic stress disorder or a worse recovery without the patient knowing why or being able to tell doctors what had happened. \"They might be aware of ongoing events but we'd never know about it,\" Menon says.  Another area in which such work could be useful is in measuring the cognitive experience of people in vegetative or minimally conscious states. Although these conditions feature little or no outward signs of consciousness, previous research has shown that patients can potentially achieve remarkable feats, such as mentally walking around a house or even imagining themselves playing tennis (see  Thoughts of woman in 'waking coma' revealed ) \n                   Brain and behaviour news  \n                 \n                   MRC Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit \n                 \n                   University of Cambridge Division of Anaesthesia \n                 Reprints and Permissions"},

The architects of a technique that has allowed biologists to identify the function of genes easily have been rewarded for their efforts with this year's Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. The technique allows researchers to generate 'knock-out' mice -mutant strains in which specific genes are disabled. These can be used to establish what role specific genes have in health, development and disease, and to create animal models of human diseases.  \"Virtually no field of biomedicine has been untouched by one knock-out strain or another in a significant way,\" says Jeremy Berg, director of the National Institute of General Medical Sciences in Bethesda, Maryland.  Mario Capecchi from the University of Utah in Salt Lake City, Martin Evans of Cardiff University in Wales and Oliver Smithies of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, share the ?1.1-million (US$1.5-million) award. As is now often the case with this Nobel prize, the trio's work had previously been recognized with a Lasker award, in 2001.  Thousands of strains of knock-out mice have been generated since use of the technique was first reported in 1989. More than 500 of these are models for specific human disorders such as cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases, and cancer. The technology's origins lie in a natural phenomenon called homologous recombination, which cells are thought to exploit to repair damaged DNA. Chromosomes, which package DNA, exist in pairs ? one inherited from each parent ? and during homologous recombination fragments of DNA can be exchanged between the two. Capecchi and Smithies found that artificial DNA of known sequence could engage in homologous recombination with mouse DNA, and exploited this to target specific mouse genes.  Evans provided the key element of heritability that eventually led to the development of knock-out mice ? strains in which a gene remains knocked out in future generations. He had the idea of using mouse embryonic stem cells to introduce genetic material into embryos from a different strain of mouse. When he injected the stem cells into the embryos, their chromosomes, as expected, combined. The mosaic embryos created could be brought to term in a surrogate mother. When the pups were mated, their offspring contained genes derived from the stem cells. Evans then began modifying the stem cells before injecting them into the mouse eggs, using retroviruses to integrate new genes into their genomes. These new genes could then be transferred into the embryos and their offspring. Combining this technique with artificial homologous recombination led to the development of the first knock-out mouse.  Important refinements to the technology ? particularly the development of 'conditional mutants' ? have made knock-outs even more valuable for biologists. A system, known as Cre-lox, has been developed in mice by Klaus Rajewsky, now of Harvard Medical School, to allow the targeted gene to be switched off at a chosen time after birth. This is important both because up to 15% of genes are essential for embryonic development and a knock-out would not survive to birth, and because some genes may become relevant for a particular disease only later in life. Smithies told  Nature  that the prize was \"not unexpected, given the calibre of the work\". Celebrating with ice-cream, he confessed to \"being pleased\". What thrills him most, he says, is opening journals to find so many papers that rely on knock-out mice. \"It's quite clear that the homologous-recombination method has contributed deeply to our understanding of the genome,\" he says. \"We may have the sequence, but knock-outs help us understand how it functions.\" In recent years, Capecchi has helped elaborate the role of particular genes in embryonic development. His work has focused particularly on body organs and the way the body plan is formed ? vital to ensuring that all of an animal's body parts are in the correct places.  Evans has developed many mouse models of important human diseases, such as cystic fibrosis, and has used these to study disease mechanisms and to try to find ways to repair defective genes. Smithies has also developed a cystic fibrosis mouse as well as models of common diseases including high blood pressure and atherosclerosis.    Now that the mouse genome has been sequenced, a worldwide effort has been launched to knock out every single one of the animal's genes.  \"The impact of the technology on the understanding of gene function and its benefits to mankind will continue to increase for many years to come,\" says Evans. \n                   Capecchi \n                 \n                   Martin Evans \n                 \n                   Oliver Smithies \n                 \n                   Nobel foundation \n                 Reprints and Permissions"},

Two researchers who discovered an effect that has dramatically shrunk the size of magnetic storage devices have won the 2007 Nobel Prize in Physics.  Albert Fert of the University of Paris-South in France and Peter Gr\u00a3nberg of J\u00a3lich Research Centre in Germany split the prize for their 1988 discovery of an effect called giant magnetoresistance (GMR). The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences announced the award on 9 October in Stockholm. The effect has been heralded as one of the first major applications of the fields of nanotechnology and 'spintronics'. \"I am so proud and so happy,\" Fert said in a press conference via telephone from France. \"Science is something marvellous.\" At the heart of GMR are the spins of electrons, which generate a magnetic field and can be aligned either up or down. An electron can easily pass through a material whose electrons are similarly aligned, but will encounter resistance when it passes through one with electrons aligned in the opposite direction. Fert and Gr\u00a3nberg discovered the effect independently of each other using multiple layers of magnetic and non-magnetic materials only tens of nanometres thick. When all the layers were aligned in the same direction, say 'up', electrons with the same alignment passed through the material easily, whereas those with the opposite alignment struggled. But when the layers were organized in an alternating 'up-down' alignment, all electrons encountered resistance. The net effect was a rise in resistance that was much bigger than any seen before ? hence 'giant'. This led to devices that are very sensitive to tiny magnetic fields. A hard disc drive stores bits on its surface as a pattern of magnetic fields. Until the discovery of GMR, hard discs used metal induction coils to read out the data. But the laws of induction meant that the coils, and thus the bits, had to be quite large. GMR opened up a way to build much smaller magnetic heads, says Claude Chappert of the University of Paris-South. The discovery revolutionized consumer electronics. \"I think this triggered the common use of MP3 players,\" he notes. By the end of the 1990s, the technology had become standard across the electronics industry, thanks partly to the work of physicist Stuart Parkin at IBM's Almaden Research Center in San Jose, California, who came up with a simple way to create the thin multilayers. Although Parkin has shared physics prizes for GMR with Fert and Gr\u00a3nberg in the past, he was not included in the Nobel announcement. Parkin conducted vital work that allowed the effect to be commercialized, but Fert and Gr\u00a3nberg were the ones who discovered it, says Tony Bland, from the University of Cambridge, UK. \"I think the field will generally see this as fair,\" he adds.   Storing information is not the only application, says Fert. The discovery has also opened the door to the possibility of 'spintronics', the idea of using electrons' spins, as well as their charge, in electronic devices. Spintronics could soon lead to random-access memory that remains stable even without power, securing data and allowing some computers to start up more quickly, says Bart van Wees of Groningen University in the Netherlands.

The British government has promised a hefty boost to science and innovation, as part of a wholesale review of national spending. The budget hike also includes a widely anticipated shot in the arm for British medical research. Overall investment in research will almost double to \u00a36 billion (US$12.2 billion) per year by 2010, as the country sets its sights on developing money-spinning innovations. The previous doubling of the science budget took a decade rather than just a few years. The rise will help to \"ensure businesses and universities are brought closer together to develop the new products and services the world wants to buy\", said Chancellor Alistair Darling, who delivered the pledge as part of a budget overhaul called the Comprehensive Spending Review.  The move follows the recommendations of former science minister David Sainsbury, who last week produced a report claiming that British science needs to invest more in high-tech research if it is to remain competitive in a globalized economy.  \n              Shot in the arm \n            By 2010, government-funded health research will have a budget of \u00a31.7 billion, of which \u00a3682 million will go to the Medical Research Council (MRC), the government's main biomedical research body ? an increase of more than half on its current budget. The extra money should give the MRC the financial clout to pursue two strategies that have previously caused consternation among staff worried that their own research interests would be marginalized as a result.  One is the proposed plan to move the National Institute of Medical Research, currently on the outskirts of London, into the centre of the city, where it will form part of a \u00a3350-million medical research campus that, with an anticipated 1,700 staff, will be the biggest in the world. The MRC is bidding for a \u00a328-million site in London, and is expected to learn within the next 3 weeks whether this has been accepted. Secondly, the increased budget looks set to give the MRC the leeway to pursue a new 'translational' agenda ? with more of an emphasis on turning research effort into clinical applications and profitable products. Proposed last year by the venture capitalist David Cooksey as a way to get maximum value out of research spending, the plan had initially been criticized by scientists wary of the knock-on effects for basic research. The MRC's new chief executive, Leszek Borysiewicz, welcomed the government?s announcement, saying: ?This is a significant boost for health research in the United Kingdom. The government?s settlement will maintain and strengthen the foundations of basic biomedical research in the United Kingdom. But it will also enable researchers to do more to translate discoveries into benefits for patients and society.\"  The government's spending pledges also include increasing the budget of Britain's Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs to \u00a34 billion, and an \u00a3800 million a year spend on flood defences in response to the anticipated increase in sea-levels.  Darling also pledged to tax commercial aviation on a per-flight, rather than per-passenger basis. \n                   Health and medicine news \n                 \n                   Policy news \n                 \n                   Medical Research Council \n                 Reprints and Permissions"},

The less often a word is said, the faster it will change over time, whereas more-often uttered words are resistant to change. In this week?s  Nature,  two groups publish analyses of this trend, which quantify it and compare it with biological evolution. The idea that aspects of culture might ?evolve? in in a similar way as biological organisms dates back to Darwin himself. The notion was given a big push forwards in 1976, when Richard Dawkins introduced the concept of ?memes? ? aspects of culture or fashion that ?propagate themselves ? by leaping from brain to brain?. That idea proved to be a successful meme in itself, becoming often-referenced in the literature. But, as Tecumseh Fitch, a psychologist at the University of St Andrews in Scotland, points out ?not much has been done? to quantify the effect. ?There is this general idea that culture evolves, but it is more of a metaphor than something that has teeth ? that obeys precise mathematical rules,? says Erez Lieberman, a specialist in evolutionary maths at Harvard University. ?I wondered: can you make this metaphor be real? Can you show a process like natural selection that is affecting ideas or language??  \n              I getted it \n            Lieberman was struck by this idea when he learned that the ten most common verbs in English (be, have, do, go, say, can, will, see, take, get) are all irregular. Instead of their past tenses ending in ?-ed?, as do 97% of English verbs, they take the peculiar forms of was, had, did, went, said, could, would, saw, took and got.  Researchers suppose that this is because often-used irregulars are easy to remember and get right. Seldom-used irregulars, on the other hand, are more likely to be forgotten, so speakers often mistakenly apply the ?-ed? rule. The most commonly used word that they found this happened to was the verb ?to help? ? the past tense used to be ?holp?, but is now ?helped?.  This could be seen as analogous to the way that crucially needed genes tend to stay the same throughout biological evolution, whereas those for less-often-used or specialist traits have more freedom to evolve. Lieberman wondered whether he could quantify the effect. He and his team looked at 177 verbs with varying frequencies of use that were irregular in Old English, and examined how many had been regularized into the ?-ed? past tense by the eras of Middle and Modern English. They found that an irregular verb used 100 times less frequently is regularized 10 times as fast. For the more mathematically inclined, this can be expressed as: 'The half-life of irregular verbs is proportional to the square root of their frequency.' 1   \n              Translate this \n            At the same time, a different group led by evolutionary bio-informaticist Mark Pagel of the University of Reading, UK, looked at 200 basic words across different Indo-European languages, to estimate their rates of evolution.  Some words sound very similar, or can be traced back to a common origin by linguists, throughout many of the languages, which suggests these words were resistant to evolution. The English word 'water', for example, is similar to the now-extinct European Gothic word 'wato', along with words in many other modern European languages. Other words were markedly different across languages, suggesting they had evolved separately and more quickly (see ). When Pagel?s team plotted frequency of word use against rate of evolution for four languages (Greek, Spanish, English and Russian), they too found that less-frequently-used words evolved faster, and that frequency can explain half of the rate of evolution. 2   ?The easiest way to think about it is that changes to the higher-frequency words are less likely to be accepted,? says Pagel. ?If I say there are two guys coming over the hill to kill us, and in fact there are 20, we might end up dead.?  \n              The meaning of it all \n            Both papers were written by teams with evolutionary biology backgrounds, and both call attention to the similarities between language change and the evolution of species. Leiberman even refers to early English as a ?primordial soup? of verb forms in his paper. Brian Joseph, a historical linguist at Ohio State University in Columbus and the editor of the journal  Language,  says that?s going too far. Early English, he says, was ?just as regular and rule-based? as modern language ? it just had more complicated rules. ?The analogy with darwinian evolution is crude, although not useless,? says Stephen Pinker, a language and cognition specialist at Harvard. ?Some portion of the variance can be accounted for by a quantitative variable such as frequency, but much more remains unexplained. You can?t understand language change without looking at the cognitive psychology of the human brains that learn and transmit the words.? \n                   Inherently Responsive, The Heredity blog  \n                 \n                   Evolution & Ecology  \n                 \n                   THE INDO-EUROPEAN LANGUAGE FAMILY from the Indo-European Documentation Center \n                 Reprints and Permissions"},

When web provider AOL's research division published an analysis of search behaviour on the Internet last year 1 , it had what it thought was a bright idea: it would reach out to academics by making an anonymized version of the data freely available for download from its website. But within hours, it had to pull the site, after bloggers managed to infer many identities from the data and view the associated search histories. AOL's mistake highlights a growing dilemma for the social sciences. The hottest growth area in the field is computational social science. This is often based on privileged access to electronic data sets such as e-mail records, mobile-phone call logs and web-search histories of millions of individuals. Such studies are ushering in a revolution in the social sciences, specialists say. But there is a trade-off between the scientific interest in working with such data and concerns about privacy. ?It's a huge issue,? says David Lazer, a researcher at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University. Lazer is co-author of a social-network analysis based on the largest mobile-phone data set ever studied by academics ? 18 weeks of details of who called whom, when and for how long, among 7 million users, representing 20% of the population of an unidentified European country, supplied by an unnamed operator 2 . A month after it appeared, Microsoft researchers published an even larger study 3 , this time of instant messages, featuring 30 billion conversations among 240 million people worldwide. Until now, social science has struggled to obtain tools that do more than scratch the surface of some of its questions. These range from identifying the driving forces behind violence, to the factors influencing how ideas, attitudes and prejudices spread through human populations. The available tools have largely remained in a time warp, consisting of analyses of national censuses, small-scale surveys, or lone researchers with a notebook observing interactions within small groups. Being able to automatically and remotely obtain such massive amounts of continuous data opens up unprecedented opportunities for social scientists to study organizations and entire communities or populations, says Marshall Van Alstyne, a researcher at Boston University. He is conducting research on the dynamics and productivity of organizations by analysing network patterns of e-mails among volunteers. ?There is enormous potential here for lines of research that shed new light on basic social-science questions,? says Jon Kleinberg, a specialist in network analysis at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York. But the privacy issue looms large. Repetition of the AOL gaffe by other researchers might create a damaging public backlash, warns Myron Gutmann, director of the Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research, based in Ann Arbor, Michigan. The consortium acts as a clearinghouse for secure access to conventional sensitive social-science data sets, such as the raw data of the US national census. ?So far, researchers have been careful, and successful at avoiding serious problems,? says Kleinberg. ?But as the number of these types of study increases, the community is clearly going to need to engage in deeper discussions about the right way to safeguard privacy in working with these kinds of data.? Lazer says the mobile-phone study was possible only after taking many precautions, including anonymizing data before researchers gained access to them, confidentiality agreements between the phone company and Harvard University, and approval and stipulations on access controls by the university's internal review board. But those ad hoc arrangements can go only so far, says Lazer, and a larger institutional framework is needed to set best practices, especially for safe sharing of data among academics. The social scientists pioneering such research often have computer-science backgrounds. As the software tools developed go mainstream, they get taken up by academics with less expertise in protecting data from abuse. Although AOL had anonymized the data it released ? 20 million web queries from around 650,000 users over 3 months ? the company overlooked the fact that people's search queries often include vanity searches on their own name. This fact, combined with context from other search queries, often allowed complete search records to be narrowed down to individuals. Using algorithms similar to those for cracking cryptography keys, Kleinberg also showed in an May paper 4  that more sophisticated attacks can be used to identify people in completely anonymized data. In the model, individuals in the network, and simulated false users, were able first to identify themselves in the network, and subsequently obtain the supposedly confidential data of all those connected to them. ?It's hard to guarantee in practice that any data set, however well anonymized, is truly safe from privacy breaches,? says Kleinberg. This work reinforces the need for a systematic, institutional approach to improving the privacy rights of those whose data are used, says Van Alstyne. That echoes the conclusions of a May study by the US National Academies 5 , which said that safeguarding privacy cannot safely be left to individual researchers. It stated that: ?Institutional solutions involve establishing tiers of risk and access, and developing data-sharing protocols that match the level of access to the risks and benefits of the planned research.? But Gutmann and other social scientists also stress that the risks should be kept in perspective. Scientists must meet strict rules on any research on human subjects. In contrast, private firms are largely free from such constraints, and already have wide latitude to snoop on, and data mine, their employees' work habits. Specialized firms, not to mention governments, are also building vast cross-referenced databases of information on every aspect of individuals' lives, including their web search behaviour, interests and personal preferences. An excessive focus on research would be ?fixing the leaky faucet when the bath-tub's overflowing?, says Van Alstyne. ?Businesses seem more prone to misuse private data than scientists of any stripe.? \n                     Computational Biology \n                   \n                     Future of Computing \n                   \n                     Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research \n                   \n                     Electronic Privacy Information Center \n                   \n                     NIH privacy site \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

It was a case of 'make love not war' winning out over 'don't ask, don't tell'. Borrowing a bad story line from a B movie, researchers at the US Air Force Research Laboratory at the Wright-Patterson Air Force base in Ohio proposed to develop chemical aphrodisiacs that would make enemy soldiers sexually irresistible to each other. The idea ? dubbed the 'gay bomb' ? earned the unnamed Ohio scientists the 2007 Ig Nobel Peace Prize, which was awarded at Harvard University on 4 October along with nine other prizes. The competition for the Peace Prize was intense even within Wright-Patterson laboratory itself. Researchers there also proposed chemicals designed to attract stinging and biting creatures, as well as low-toxicity compounds that would ?create severe and lasting halitosis? for those exposed to tiny concentrations. Despite the merits of the competing concepts, none had quite the 'legs', so to speak, of the gay bomb. The Ig Nobels ? a spoof of the real Nobel prizes (see  page 642 ) ? have been awarded annually since 1991. But the gay bomb would never have basked in their glow had it not been for the Sunshine Project in Austin, Texas. The group's director Edward Hammond caught wind of the report when he saw a promotional CD-ROM of 'non-lethal weapons', prompting him to seek all supporting documents under the Freedom of Information Act. The fate of the gay bomb project is unclear, says Ig Nobel impresario Marc Abrahams, who was told by former lab staff that ?if research on the gay bomb had proceeded further, it would have immediately been stamped secret, and neither you nor I would have any way of knowing about it.? Fortunately, however, the Ig Nobel selection committee was lucky enough to hear about the idea, as well as others that warranted similar distinction. The Linguistics Prize, for example, went to researchers from the University of Barcelona in Spain for showing that rats cannot always distinguish between a person speaking Japanese backwards and a person speaking Dutch backwards. Brian Witcombe of Gloucestershire Royal NHS Foundation Trust, UK, shared the Medicine Prize with Dan Meyer of Sword Swallowers' Association International in Antioch, Tennessee, for their report, ?Sword Swallowing and Its Side Effects?.

Tonight is going to see an extremely happy party thrown for Gerhard Ertl. Not only is it his seventy-first birthday, but he has also won this years Nobel Prize in Chemistry, for his studies of chemical processes on solid surfaces. Ertls research laid the groundwork for a science that, as the Nobel prize committee notes, allows us to understand processes ranging from the rusting of iron at the surface of our cars to the destruction of the ozone layer at the surface of ice crystals in the stratosphere. Ertl, who in 2004 retired as director of the Max Planck Societys Fritz-Haber Institute in Berlin, said he was not expecting another Nobel to be awarded to a German after countryman Peter G won yesterdays physics prize (see  The physics prize inside the iPod ). I was very surprised, he said in a broadcasted phone call with the Nobel foundation. It is the greatest honour you can think of. Asked what gifts he had received on his birthday, apart from sciences greatest honour, Ertl replied, I got a walking stick.  \n              Surface insight \n            Ertls main impact was not in determining it was important to study surfaces (the growth of the semiconductor industry hammered that home), nor in developing instrumentation to study them. Rather he had the inspiration to see how various techniques already in use could be adapted and stitched together to provide a complete picture of how molecules behave at a surface. Such insights are crucial to understanding the action of catalysts materials that speed up chemical reactions without being used up. Ertls insights provided the scientific basis of modern surface chemistry, says the prize committee. Perhaps the most impressive individual work undertaken by Ertl involved proving the exact mechanism of the HaberBosch process, a reaction vital to the chemical industry and the production of fertilizer. The process converts hydrogen and nitrogen into ammonia using an iron catalyst. Using a variety of spectroscopic techniques which use the interaction of electromagnetic radiation (such as light) with materials to determine the properties of surface molecules Ertl uncovered how and when the strong nitrogen bond is broken during this process, proving which of many suggested mechanisms was correct.  In a statement, Andrea Sella, lecturer in chemistry at University College London, said the HaberBosch process was the industrial process which can safely be said to have had the widest impact on mankind. She added: Gerhard Ertl was one of the first chemists to start taking a very detailed look at what happens on the surface how the individual molecules land and stick to it, how they are split into individual atoms, and how they migrate across the surface to generate the final product, ammonia. Ertls other work has included determining how reactions proceed in catalytic converters and how hydrogen molecules organize themselves at metal surfaces.  \n              Well done \n            Graham Hutchings, a physical chemist at Cardiff University, UK, said the award was extremely justifiable. Its superb that the field of surface science has been recognized. Hes taken a look at how molecules interact with surfaces at a very fundamental level. The number of devices that can be made because of this fundamental understanding is immense. The chemical community has welcomed this years award not least because it has gone to a proper chemist, rather than one who could be considered a biologist, as has happened in many recent years. Many in the community are, however, wondering why the award was not shared by Gabor Somorjai, a surface chemist from the University of California, Berkeley. Ertl and Somorjai shared the 1998 Wolf Foundation Prize in Chemistry for their work in surface science. \n                   Nobel site \n                 \n                   Ertl website \n                 Reprints and Permissions"},

A drive through Yellowstone National Park these days is like going on a photo safari: elk, bison, deer, big horn and moose hang out so close to the roads that it?s easy to spot them. Research now shows this isn?t because the area is jam-packed with animals ? some mammals seem to be attracted to the roads as a shield against predators.  The idea that prey protect themselves by hanging around roads and people has been suspected for some time. ?We have seen elk congregating around human areas in Banff National Park in Canada, and deer clustering along the edges of roads in the Rocky Mountains, and always thought there was something more to this,? says Dave Augeri, a conservation biologist at the Denver Zoological Foundation in Colorado. Now, research conducted by Joel Berger of the Wildlife Conservation Society, in Teton Valley, Idaho, puts hard evidence behind these suspicions.  In the Yellowstone area, bears tend to stay clear of roads because rangers have taken active measures to make them wary of people. Berger set out to see whether other animals would take advantage of this situation, particularly when at their most vulnerable: when giving birth. Between 1995 and 2004, Berger monitored births from 25 female moose in and around Grand Teton National Park, inside the Yellowstone ecosystem. He reports in  Biology Letters 1  that pregnant moose moved an average of 122 metres closer to roads each year of their birthing period, bringing them from 1,000 metres to 380 metres of the road; non-pregnant moose, and those in bear-free areas, did not move. Berger suggests that the pregnant moose move because their calves are heavily predated on by bears, and the bears keep away from roads. ?It would seem that moose mothers are using the fear that bears have of roads to protect their young when they are most vulnerable,? says Berger.  \n              Not so pristine \n            Park managers for Yellowstone and the Grand Tetons have struggled to keep their environments as untouched as possible. Bans on feeding wildlife are in place, litter control has been honed to a fine art and vast sections of the parks have no human structures at all ? visiting them requires days of travel on foot. The fact that a few roads can disrupt the ecosystem so greatly creates a dilemma for the conservationists responsible for keeping the areas wild. ?This just points out that ecotourism is not some gilded pathway,? says Fred Bercovitch, a behavioural biologist at the centre for Conservation and Research for Endangered Species in San Diego, California. Even watching animals discreetely from the safety of a car can change their behaviour. Fortunately, Berger notes that the redistribution of moose mothers in this instance could be a unique and possibly temporary phenomenon. Before 1950, bears were hunted in the Grand Tetons. When the park was established and hunting ceased, bears migrated in from the neighbouring countryside. ?These back-country bears had little or no experience with humans and it?s entirely possible that they may still be adapting to the roads they are encountering,? Berger says.  The bears in Grand Teton National Park could well grow more comfortable with roads in the future, putting an end to the protection that the roads currently grant to prey. In Alaska and the northern rockies, bears seem to be used to roads, and pregnant moose don?t seem to be attracted to them. ?This is an intriguing phenomenon with essential implications for conservation,? says Augeri. ?Clearly, we have to look much more closely at the unanticipated influences our activities are having on predator?prey relationships.? \n                   Yellowstone National Park \n                 \n                   Grand Teton National Park \n                 \n                   Wildlife Conservation Society \n                 Reprints and Permissions"},

Two papers published this week challenge the validity of using the protein Oct4 as a marker for adult stem cells. The protein maintains embryonic stem cells in an undifferentiated state, called pluripotency, but the papers question whether it has the same function in adult stem cells. Oct4 controls gene expression during the early stages of embryo formation, but switches off in somatic cells shortly thereafter. It thus seems logical that Oct4 might also control adult stem cells, and more than 60 studies have used Oct4 expression as a marker of these cells. But now, Rudolf Jaenisch's lab at the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research in Cambridge, Massachusetts, has used several approaches to test for Oct4 expression in adult stem cells in mice 1 . All came up negative. ?It's hard to prove beyond any doubt that something is not expressed or doesn't have a function,? says author Christopher Lengner, also from the Whitehead Institute. ?That's why we had to use overlapping methods. We beat the thing to death.? Lengner and his colleagues aren't alone. Several years ago, Lorenza Lazzari, of the Maggiore Foundation Hospital in Milan, Italy, and her colleagues detected low levels of Oct4 expression in adult stem cells, but their negative controls, which did not contain stem cells, yielded the same result. Lazzari had found it difficult to publish her work, but eventually succeeded earlier this year 2 . ?The dogma of Oct4 as a stem-cell marker was stated by several scientists working on somatic stem cells and it has been very difficult to convince editors,? says Lazzari, who says that she has had several manuscripts on the topic rejected. Many published papers showing Oct4 expression simply didn't include a negative control, Lengner says. Lazzari's false-positive results could be due to the presence of several  Oct4 -related genes that do not code for functional protein, says Gesine K\u00e9gler of the Heinrich-Heine University in D\u00e9sseldorf, Germany. K\u00e9gler and her colleagues found that many approaches used to detect Oct4 cannot distinguish between the functional  Oct4  gene and its related pseudogenes 3 . Lengner also says that many papers relied on stem cells that had been maintained as cell cultures for many generations, and may no longer reflect what occurs in live animals. This doesn't necessarily mean that adult stem cells are not pluripotent, notes Leendert Looijenga, a pathologist at the Erasmus Medical Center in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. It does, however, suggest that they are regulated differently from embryonic ones. Looijenga and his colleagues have tested more than 3,600 cancer tissue samples, representing more than 100 cancers.

A Canadian court has acquitted four doctors and a US blood products company of criminal negligence in the case of four haemophiliacs who were infected with HIV after receiving transfusions of tainted blood in the 1980s. After a five-year police investigation and a lengthy trial that involved more than 100 witnesses and 1,000 exhibits, Judge Mary Lou Benotto of the Ontario Superior Court of Justice in Toronto effectively said that the doctors and the company were not only acquitted but fully exonerated. ?The allegations of criminal conduct on the part of these men and this corporation were not only unsupported by the evidence, they were disproved,? Benotto wrote in her 1 October decision. ?The events here were tragic. However, to assign blame where none exists is to compound the tragedy.? The case is the latest of numerous global investigations into the circumstances in which thousands of patients were given infected blood even after it became known, in autumn 1984, that heat treatment killed HIV in blood products. More than 1,000 Canadians, about 700 of them with haemophilia, were infected by HIV from transfusions, almost all of them before mid-1985. The Canadian court case addressed the infection of 4 people in British Columbia and Alberta in 1986 and 1987. They received an HIV-infected blood-clotting product made by Armour Pharmaceutical, then a maker of blood products based in New Jersey. The now-elderly doctors charged were Roger Perrault, then the national director of the Canadian Red Cross blood transfusion service; John Furesz, then director of Health Canada's Bureau of Biologics (BDB); Wark Boucher, who headed the BDB's blood product division; and Michael Rodell, then a vice-president of Armour Pharmaceutical. The Canadian Hemophilia Society said it was ?surprised and disappointed? by the outcome. ?This verdict sends the wrong message to those responsible for the health of the public,? Pam Wilton, its president, said in statement. But David Scott, an Ottawa lawyer who defended Furesz, said: ?These charges were undoubtedly politically motivated. If those in charge of the criminal process succumb to political pressure to lay criminal charges in inappropriate cases, they will unwittingly undermine the public confidence in the administration of justice.? Lawyers for the Crown didn't say whether they plan to appeal within the 30-day time frame allowed. ?I cannot imagine them doing so,? says Edward Greenspan, the Toronto lawyer who represented Perrault. ?But then again I couldn't imagine them spending 17 months in a court of law proving nothing.? \n                     AIDS Medics in Libya \n                   \n                     AIDS special (2004) \n                   \n                     Nature Medicine -- Twenty years of HIV science (2003) \n                   \n                     Nature insight (2001) \n                   \n                     Canadian Hemophilia Society \n                   \n                     Edward Greenspan wikipedia entry \n                   \n                     David Scott, Ottawa attorney \n                   \n                     1997 Krever Report: Commission of Inquiry on the Blood System in Canada \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Human activity is behind the rising levels of water vapour in the lower atmosphere over the past few decades, climatologists have concluded. The rises in humidity could affect patterns of extreme storms, they warn. Although water vapour is an important greenhouse gas in the upper atmosphere, the rising levels closer to Earth's surface will not greatly affect the overall warming of the planet, says Nathan Gillett of the University of East Anglia in Norwich, UK, and an author of the study. But the results provide yet more evidence that we are changing the climate. According to the researchers' computer models, the best explanation for the rising humidity is that human-produced greenhouse gases have warmed the planet and boosted the amount of water vapour produced by evaporation as part of the global water cycle. \"To put it crudely it's because warmer air can hold more moisture,\" Gillett says. Previous tools used to forecast world precipitation patterns may have underestimated the effect of this extra moisture in the lower atmosphere, the researchers say. Higher humidity is likely to exacerbate problems with extreme precipitation and tropical cyclones, they conclude.  \n              Getting wetter \n            Gillett and his team studied existing measurements of atmospheric humidity from 1973 to 2002, recorded by a network of land-based stations as well as ships, buoys and marine platforms. Over this period the humidity in the lower atmosphere rose by an average of 0.07 grams per kilogram of air worldwide. This is in line with what would be expected in a warming world ? air can absorb roughly 6-7% more moisture for every 1 \u00a3C rise in temperature. The researchers simulated atmospheric moisture levels using a computer model that evaluates the effects of various natural factors, such as changes in solar activity and greenhouse-gas emissions. They then compared the trends seen in the different simulations with the real-world results. The simulations that incorporated the effects of human activities most accurately reproduced the real-world trend, Gillett and his colleagues report in this week's  Nature 1 . The best-fit simulation was so good that it even mimicked variations in the real data, such as the spike seen in 1997?98, when a strong El Ni\u00a3o event warmed Caribbean waters and led to increased humidity. The work follows research published last month 2 , in which researchers led by Benjamin Santer of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California used a similar method to rule out other natural effects as a cause of rising humidity. They showed that the clearing of skies that happened after the 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo, though it let more sunlight in, wasn't wholly responsible for increased water in the air as some people had thought. \"As the world is warming up, it is changing as we expected,\" says Peter Stott, a climatologist at the Hadley Centre for Climate Prediction and Research in Exeter, UK. Work like this shows how mankind is having an effect on complex climate issues, he says - beyond just the temperature. The research shows that climate models are performing well, Stott adds. But predicting the incidence of highly localized, extreme events such as tropical storms will require new models with finer detail, he adds. \"Basic climate models don't have the high resolution needed.\" \n                   Climate change \n                 \n                   Earth and environment \n                 \n                   University of East Anglia Climatic Research Unit \n                 \n                   Hadley Centre for Climate Prediction and Research \n                 Reprints and Permissions"},

How long have I got left, doctor? For a cell, at least, scientists may be close to an answer. A cell's lifespan depends on the length of its telomeres ? the regions of repeating DNA that protect the ends of chromosomes. Every time a cell divides, its telomeres get shorter until they become unstable and cause chromosomes to fuse together. These fusions can make the chromosomes break when cells divide, leading to cell death or triggering genomic rearrangements associated with the early stages of cancer. Now, Duncan Baird of the University of Cardiff, UK, and his colleagues have found the shortest length telomeres can reach before they cause fusion. In addition to the steady loss associated with ageing, random mutations can cause large stochastic deletions that dramatically shrink telomeres in young, healthy cells. Baird's team focused on such cells from fetal human lung cultures whose telomeres had shrunk to the threshold length of less than 77 base pairs long. ?These were normal human cells that had long, functional telomeres,? says Baird. ?You wouldn't expect any telomeric problems.? The critical telomere length was 12.8 repeats (of six base pairs) long, they found ? any shorter and the chromosomes began to fuse together at their ends (R. Capper  et al .  Genes Dev.  doi:10.1101/gad.439107; 2007). Baird suggests that without sufficiently long telomere caps, the cell may perceive the chromosome ends as broken strands of DNA and attempt to piece them together. The new results support the argument that it is the shortest rather than the average telomere length that counts, says Dominique Broccoli, a molecular oncologist at Memorial Health University Medical Center in Savannah, Georgia. ?It's important to know just how short that telomere needs to be,? she says. ?It's something that people have talked about for a long time.? Although scientists suspected that this fusion might occur in otherwise healthy cells, this is the first time it has been demonstrated, says Laure Sabatier of the department of radiology and oncology at the French Atomic Energy Commission in Fontenay-aux-Roses. ?This suggests that loss of large parts of telomeres would occur even during normal cell proliferation,? she says. Baird estimates that telomere fusion occurs in nearly four out of every million cells in young, healthy human cells in the lab. The researchers also gained fresh insight into the process by which chromosomes fuse across their depleted telomeres. Each end chemically stitches together in an error-prone mechanism that can itself yield large DNA deletions. The stitching mechanism ? called microhomology-mediated end joining ? aligns and joins the ends of the two chromosomes via tiny sections of their complementary base-pair sequences ? sometimes only six nucleotides long. This represents an interesting new pathway of telomere-driven genome rearrangements, says Broccoli. \n                      Web Focus: DNA Metabolism \n                   \n                      DNA replication and repair supplement \n                   \n                     Cancer In Focus \n                   \n                     Genes and Development \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

India's blooming carbon market has emerged as the hottest destination for companies in the industrialized world seeking to do their bit in the fight against global warming. But as one of the first nations to move aggressively into carbon trading, India has also been the first to collide with the teething troubles of the fledgling market. ?There is a problem with the process of the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) itself that no one has been able to remove,? says Chandra Bhushan, associate director of the Centre for Science and Environment in New Delhi. ?Independent oversight, to ensure that the processes are clean, just isn't there yet.? The CDM was established under the auspices of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. It lets nations buy certified emissions reductions, or 'carbon credits', from countries that earn them by cutting greenhouse-gas emissions. Several issues lie at the heart of India's troubles with carbon commerce. They include the country's lack of preparedness, the United Nation's inexperience with the market, the technical difficulties of managing, supervising and regulating projects, and delays in the Kyoto Protocol coming into effect. Despite the early setbacks, observers say that a solid system of checks and balances is now coming into place. ?Because India was and currently is the CDM leader, it is natural that the problems were first faced by Indian projects,? says Jos\u00e9 Domingos Miguez, an official in Brazil's Ministry of Science and Technology and a member and former chair of the CDM's executive board, which oversees the mechanism. ?This is a learning-by-doing process.? India is home to 282 of the world's 803 registered carbon-trading projects, according to the United Nations ? more than China (116) and India (108) combined. And analysts say that Indian companies have already earned about US$350 million from these ventures. With another 435 projects in the pipeline, the earnings will quickly run into billions of dollars. Some claim that the offsetting mechanism is susceptible to easy fraud, but Indian firms counter that they have to jump through several regulatory hoops to gain registration. Under the Marrakech Accords of 2001, which fleshed out the rules for meeting Kyoto targets, projects must clear three stages of review ? a process that generally takes about a year to complete. Once a firm identifies a way to reduce emissions in its business ? by switching to wind power, for example ? it has to clear its idea with a government task force appointed inside each nation. Then, the projects are audited by UN-accredited 'designated operational entities', which check their methodology, documentation, finances and eligibility. Around six such entities operate in India. In the third stage, the CDM's executive board, comprising senior climate scientists and officials from around the world, makes the final call. Projects that get the green light can finalize deals with buyers in developed nations. For the rest of the project's duration, UN-appointed auditors visit at regular intervals, awarding credits on the basis of the extent of reductions made.  \n                Delayed take-off \n              Just after Marrakech, Indian companies were among the first to propose eligible projects. But the CDM board, established in 2001, didn't actually start operating properly until the Kyoto Protocol went into force, in February 2005. Even then, Miguez says, it was almost a year before the cash and people were available to monitor projects on the ground adequately. That meant that scores of Indian firms, which filed more than 100 applications before 2005, moved headlong into the process in the absence of clear guidelines. ?Everything was a confusion to begin with,? recalls Subhash Rastogi, vice-president for environment, health and safety at the multi-product firm ITC in Kolkata, which moved into the carbon market in 2003 and has since registered seven projects. Soon, the Indian carbon market began to rack up bad publicity. Questions surfaced about the legitimacy of its projects and the competence of the auditing firms appointed to oversee them. Pressure groups such as the Center for Science and Environment criticized the wrongful approval of undeserving projects. In particular, a rule agreed at Marrakech allowed for the automatic registration of a project unless at least three board members request to review it within 4?8 weeks. ?Some of the projects were going through the automatic mode and getting registered easily,? says Rajesh Kumar Sethi, vice-chair of the CDM board and director of the climate-change department in India's Ministry of Environment and Forests. ?The CDM secretariat was thinly staffed at the time ? but those types of projects are very rare now.? The secretariat, based in Bonn, Germany, now has a technical staff of about 100 to support the 20 board members, Sethi says. The board undertook three random spot-checks last year to keep tabs on national performance, Miguez adds, and it has been updating documentation requirements to tighten up the process.  \n                Measure of doubt \n              An obvious problem, however, is the calculation of greenhouse-gas reductions for specific technologies. These calculations require a baseline from which to measure ? but that has been tough to establish in several industry sectors, such as aluminium, cement and agriculture. Another issue is the mechanism's crucial 'additionality' requirement, which holds that to be eligible for benefits, a project has to show that it is genuinely reducing emissions by more than it would have done otherwise. ?Additionality is subjective,? says Sethi. ?Somebody may say it's additional while somebody else may say that it's not.? That murkiness is creating situations in which some companies think that their projects have been rejected unfairly. ?A certain randomness persists at the level of the executive board,? says Suresh Iyer, deputy general manager of JSW Steel in Mumbai, which has won the world's largest credit award for any one project, for fuel-replacement at its steel mills. ?There is no forum in which companies can defend their projects directly in front of the board.? ?The feeling of rejection is worse when you don't know the reason,? says a high-level executive at a leading cement company who didn't want to be named. ?We applied for two projects with exactly the same methodology. Only one got accepted ? although the rejected one is a much stronger case.? Of 36 projects that the CDM board has rejected so far, 14 are from India. ?The secretariat is still not resourced adequately, either in numbers or expertise,? says Paravastu Rambabu, managing director of Indian operations for the consulting firm Cantor CO2E. He adds that auditing companies face similar capacity constraints. Furthermore, companies seeking to join the CDM pay the auditors' fees, and that's a conflict of interest, according to critics. Miguez says that such payment arrangements were laid down at Marrakech, but agrees that it would be better if the CDM board paid the auditors itself. ?With every new system, there will be pluses and minuses,? notes Iyer. ?But as the number of projects grows, and as companies have seen actual money coming in, awareness and confidence in the process is also growing.? \n                     Market takes a gamble on carbon futures NATURE \n                   \n                     The corporate race to cut carbon NATURE REPORTS CLIMATE CHANGE \n                   \n                     Carbon market survives gas leaks NATURE \n                   \n                     The Clean Development Mechanism \n                   \n                     Global CDM project pipeline maintained by the UNEP \n                   \n                     The clean development mechanism in India \n                   \n                     International Emissions Trading Association \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

The inaugural climate summit hosted by President George W. Bush in Washington DC last week was greeted with cautious optimism from some scientists. But his continued insistence on voluntary measures for reducing greenhouse-gas emissions met with intense scepticism from international delegates and observers. And although Bush underscored the risks posed by global warming in a public speech on 28 September, many scientists and advocates say his administration continues to oppose actions necessary to mitigate the problem. Peter Cox, a climate modeller at the University of Exeter, UK, says he is pleased that the United States is now ?raising the flag? on global warming, abandoning a previous stance that, he says, amounted to denial. ?Essentially, what we had before was the uncertainties in the long-term projections, which are always going to be there, being used as a reason for inaction,? Cox says. ?It is a relief that people are talking about the need for action despite the fact that there are still significant uncertainties.? But in the first US-government-hosted climate summit, Bush offered no specific targets or solutions, aside from the establishment of an international fund to promote clean-energy projects in the developing world and a general endorsement of technology as the best solution. ?There is a way forward that will enable us to grow our economies and protect the environment, and that's called technology,? he said. The administration, which invited developing nations to the talks, also continued to push for voluntary measures that could be designed and implemented at the national level. This was seen as another effort to draw support from developing nations, whose emissions are increasing sharply, and are expected to continue to do so in the coming decades. ?You can't solve this problem on voluntary measures. It's a fraud,? says climatologist Stephen Schneider, from Stanford University in California, who says that even immediate action might not prevent a rise of 2 \u00e9C above pre-industrial levels. ?The science is very clear that unless we are incredibly lucky or there is an incredible breakthrough, we are going to be well over 2 \u00e9C,? he adds. ?The impact-assessment folks say that is when you are going to have all sorts of nasty stuff.? John Ashton, the UK climate-change envoy attending the summit, criticized the Bush administration for failing to suggest a target for the United Nations' climate negotiations that are scheduled for December in Bali, Indonesia. Many European countries are calling for a treaty that would require emissions cuts of more than 50% by 2050. ?If you accept the science, if you want to be taken seriously as accepting the science, you have to be willing to say to the international community where you think the threshold of dangerous climate change lies,?

In a report released on 1 October, the JASON defence advisory group, which consults regularly for the government on a range of technical issues, said there was insufficient peer review over the design for the Reliable Replacement Warhead (RRW). The RRW is to be built without compromising a 1992 US moratorium on all nuclear tests. The report also calls for an extensive battery of non-nuclear 'subcritical' tests to ensure that the new warhead will work as required. Panel-member Roy Schwitters, a physicist at the University of Texas in Austin, says that the design's ?approach is valid?, but ?in lieu of new underground tests, we feel that peer review should have a bigger role? in the certification process. At present, the internal peer-review process of the three involved labs looks only at aspects of the design, not the entire system, he says. The agency responsible for maintaining the US nuclear stockpile ? the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) ? claims that the RRW would be more dependable than the current generation of cold war weapons. It would also contain new safeguards that would prevent its use if it fell into the hands of terrorists. But arms-control advocates say the programme is a costly handout to the nation's nuclear weapons laboratories and, they say, questions about the RRW's design could lead to renewed testing. The report is a further setback for the programme, which is already under enormous congressional scrutiny, says Jeffrey Lewis, an arms-control expert at the New America Foundation in Washington DC. ?It suggests that the NNSA did a poor job in putting together a certification plan,? he says. This week, the NNSA also reported that its dismantlement of deployed warheads had accelerated by 146% over the 2007 fiscal year ? three times greater than it had anticipated. Under the 2002 Strategic Offensive Reductions Treaty with Russia, the United States is committed to reducing its warheads to between 1,700 and 2,200 by 2012. \n                     Nuclear Proliferation Special \n                   \n                     House Appropriations Subcommittee on Energy and Water Development \n                   \n                     National Nuclear Security Administration \n                   \n                     RRW Fact Sheet \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Man's best friend is becoming the geneticist's too. Researchers have made good on the dog genome's promise: a quick-and-dirty way to find the genes responsible for physical traits using just a couple of dozen pooches and a gene chip. Kerstin Lindblad-Toh, of the Broad Institute of Harvard and Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and her colleagues have devised a method of locating the genes responsible for specific traits that requires as few as 10 animals with the feature and 10 without ? as long as they are all the same breed 1 . The team has also identified the genes that give the Rhodesian ridgeback breed its ridge but additionally predispose the dogs to a crippling developmental disease called dermoid sinus 2 . Such feats were predicted when Lindblad-Toh's team mapped the dog genome 3  but this is the first time they have been achieved. The technique exploits the unique evolutionary history of dogs, which humans tamed from grey wolves between 15,000 and 100,000 years ago. Over centuries, humans have bred dogs, selecting for traits such as size and ability to herd sheep. Most of the 400 breeds descend from just a handful of hounds. The result: vast stretches of genetic similarity in dogs of the same breed, allowing geneticists to spot the few differences relatively easily. ?Here you have the perfect genetic model,? says Leif Andersson, a biologist at the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, in Uppsala, Sweden, who co-leads the project. Using a gene chip that analysed about 27,000 single-letter differences across the entire dog genome, the team identified a region of 750,000 base pairs in the Rhodesian ridgeback genome that differed between ridged and unridged animals. The unridged version accounts for just 5% of ridgebacks because breeders select for the trait 1 . To identify the specific genes, the team turned to Thai ridgebacks, which exhibit the same feature without being closely related to the Rhodesians. By comparing the same DNA stretch between the breeds, the team discovered the culprit: extra copies of four genes involved in fetal development. The finding helps explain the prevalence of dermoid sinus in the dogs. This painful development disorder, where the skin fails to separate from the nerve chord, affects nearly one-tenth of Rhodesian ridgebacks, says team-member Claire Wade, a geneticist at the Broad Institute. ?Often the animals have to be put down,? she says. Dogs lacking the duplication of genes are unridged; those with one copy have a normal ridge; but having two copies also carries an 80% risk of dermoid sinus. The mechanism paves the way for geneticists to use the dog genome to help identify genes involved in disorders such as diabetes that also affect humans. \n                     Nature Genome Gateway \n                   \n                     Dog Genome Resources \n                   \n                     Submit Your Dog's DNA \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Video cameras are now small enough to attach to wild birds, giving a view of the world as seen through the legs of New Caledonian crows or from the back of a penguin. A week before a big ?critter cam? conference is to be held in Washington DC,  Nature News  looks at how the cameras can benefit bird buffs.  \n              What?s new? \n            Researchers have created a tiny camera and radio tracker that can be attached to the tail feathers of New Caledonian crows ( Corvus moneduloides ) ? the unusually clever birds that use tools to dig insects out of rotting wood. The cameras weigh just 14.5 grams (lighter than a British \u00a32 coin), and protrude through the underside of the tail and peek through the birds? legs towards its head. New Caledonian crows are unusually adept at making and using tools. So zoologist Christian Rutz of the University of Oxford, UK, and his colleagues wanted to see if they could work out why these crows had developed fondness for cutlery. Their initial results (see  video  ) are reported this week in  Science .  \n              Why do you need to mount a camera directly on the bird?  \n            New Caledonian crows can be tough to catch on tape. They are notoriously anxious around people. When approached, they either run away or advance on the intruder in large, shouting mobs. ?This, of course, is not desirable when you want to observe natural undisturbed behaviour,? says Rutz.  \n              I?m sure that I?ve heard of animal cameras before. Aren?t animals tagged with cameras all the time? \n            Sure, but researchers have typically focused on larger animals. Marine animals in particular can carry heavier cameras underwater as long as the weight is offset by buoyant material. The only wild birds to have been tagged with cameras are those that spend some of their time underwater. Akinori Takahashi of the National Institute of Polar Research Institute in Tokyo, Japan, has studied group behaviour in Adelie and chinstrap penguins by tagging them with cameras that take still photos every few seconds (see picture, right). And David Gr\u00a3millet of France?s basic-science agency, the CNRS in Montpellier, France, has attached video cameras to cormorants to study their underwater hunting technique (see video, right).  \n              But what about that that BBC documentary a few years ago? They put cameras on birds. \n            The birds used for the 2004 BBC programme, Animal Camera, were tame and had been trained to wear cameras latched onto harnesses. The movie?s avian cast consisted of large birds such as peregrines, goshawks and golden eagles, which can fly for short periods of time carrying the heavier cameras. Adrian Thomas, a zoologist at the University of Oxford who worked on the documentary, says that he and his colleagues have also managed to cram cameras, accelerometers, magnetometers, gyros and global-positioning devices onto their birds. Paragliding researchers can then signal the trained birds to perform tricks, which are recorded in detail.  \n              How did they manage to make these crow cameras so small? \n            Thank your mobile-phone company. The push to miniaturize mobile-phone cameras has driven down the size of cameras in recent years.  The hardest part has traditionally been shrinking the size of the batteries, says animal physiologist Terrie Williams of the University of California in Santa Cruz. ?Carrying a pack of batteries would easily ground a small bird,? she says. Whale cams can collect 24 hours or more of footage thanks to their heavy batteries; crow cams can last for just over an hour, she notes. ?Although I am sure the bird?s-eye view will eventually catch up with the whale-eye view,? Williams says.  \n              This video is so shaky and hard to watch. Don?t you have anything any better? \n            Animals don?t always make the best movie directors, and their target audiences are researchers, not moviegoers (which is good, given that the New Caledonian crows clearly think nothing of relieving themselves on camera). To researchers, even the irritating bumps and wiggles can reveal key information about animal biomechanics, says Williams. ?The camera jiggle ? the stuff that ends up on the cutting room floor that makes you sea sick when you watch it is actually so valuable,? she says.

Telomeres, the stretches of repetitive DNA that cap chromosome ends, have long been thought to be solely for protecting the ?important? DNA behind them from wear and tear. Now researchers have discovered that these caps are doing something more ? they?re coding for RNA. ?This really is a breakthrough,? says Laure Sabatier, a molecular biologist at the French Atomic Energy Commission in Fontenay-aux-Roses, who was not associated with the study. Each time chromosomes are replicated, some of the DNA at the ends is lost. Telomeres buffer against the removal of important genetic information by sacrificing their own length rather than allowing deletions to creep into the portions of DNA that code for RNA and protein. That means that as cells age, telomeres gradually become shorter. Some cancer cells achieve immortality by maintaining long telomeres, and the proteins responsible for achieving this are potential targets for anti-cancer therapies.  The DNA that makes up telomeres does not contain recognizable genes. If anything, they have a gene-silencing effect ? the structure of telomeres can interfere with nearby stretches of DNA, stopping them from producing RNA. No one expected telomeres to serve as a DNA template for the synthesis of RNA, says Sabatier.  \n              Serendipity \n            The discovery was made by accident. Joachim Lingner, of the Swiss Institute of Experimental Cancer Research in Epalinges and the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne, and his colleagues were studying a protein involved in degrading RNA. They noticed that the protein was associated with telomeres. ?We reasoned that if you have this entire machinery sitting at the telomere, perhaps there is RNA there,? says Lingner. From there it was a simple assay to see whether RNA corresponding to the telomere sequence was present. Lingner and his co-workers found the RNA, which remained clustered primarily near the telomeres. The results are published this week in  Science 1 .  Whether the discovery will provide new avenues for cancer therapies remains unclear, Lingner notes. It isn?t yet known what the RNA is doing ? it isn?t expected to code for protein, but Lingner speculates that it may have a role in regulating telomere length. The researchers found that if they deleted RNA-degrading proteins located nearby, more of the telomere RNA accumulated around the telomeres. When this occurred, the telomeres became unstable and were more likely to fragment.  ?We see a high rate of telomere loss at the same time as the RNA levels go up at the telomere,? says Lingner, ?but it is important to know whether it is the RNA that directly creates this problem?. \n                   DNA Metabolism Web Focus  \n                 \n                   DNA Replication and Repair supplement \n                 \n                   Joachim Lingner?s webpage \n                 Reprints and Permissions"},

An anaesthetic method that kills pain without producing numbness or preventing movement has been developed.  Current local anaesthetics work by indiscriminately blocking all the channels in a nerve cell, so they can block movement and sensation as well as pain.  However, the new technique involves using a combination of two compounds to home in on pain-sensing nerves in a specific area, leaving other functions unaffected. It could prove useful for situations where patients require anaesthetic, but also need to be able to move or control muscles, such as in childbirth and in some dental procedures.  Bruce Bean of Harvard Medical School in Boston, Massachusetts, and his colleagues targeted the pain by taking advantage of an ion channel called TRPV1, which is only present in pain-sensing nerve cells. This channel opens when it senses capsaicin, the active ingredient in chilli peppers. Working on cultures of neurons, the researchers used capsaicin to open the ion channel, allowing their painkiller of choice ? a local anaesthetic called QX-314 ? to enter the cell. QX-314 is similar to the commonly-used local anaesthetic lidocaine, but, unlike lidocaine, it has no effect unless it is acting from within a cell. The team found that capsaicin did indeed allow the anaesthetic to only enter pain-sensing neurons, where it could then dampen the action of these cells. The combination of compounds also worked in live animals. When the team injected rats with QX-314 and capsaicin, the animals didn?t react to a normally-painful stimulus applied to their foot once the painkiller had taken effect. But the rats could move around as normal. The team?s results are reported online in  Nature 1 .  \n              Better together \n            Capsaicin is already in use as a painkiller for conditions where pain fibres are overactive, says Michael Caterina of Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in Baltimore, Maryland, who also studies the TRPV1 channel. Applying it overstimulates the nerve endings and de-sensitises them, persuading them to stop overreacting. But, as its link to chilli peppers suggests, it produces an uncomfortable burning sensation and can?t be given in high doses.  Caterina say he thinks the new study is a neat trick, because it may be able to get around this problem. As the capsaicin and anaesthetic are applied at the same time, the capsaicin grants the anaesthetic admission to the cell, where activity is dampened down so that pain (including the burning sensation) is relieved.  ?It?s a match made in heaven,? he says. ?They?ve taken a number of reagents in common use in pain, and put them together in a very creative way.?  \n              Better for baby \n            A number of clinical procedures could benefit from a local anaesthetic that doesn?t paralyse or numb the patient. The most obvious is childbirth, where retaining muscle control is important. The commonly-used epidural, which involves injecting anaesthetic into the spine to block the nerves leading to the womb and lower parts of the body, also blocks all movement and feeling, making it harder for the mother-to-be to ?push? the baby out.  Another use could be in dentistry, where blocking some nerves can lead to unhelpful drooling. The method could also be used to treat some chronic pain conditions, where constant pain is caused by abnormally active pain fibres.  Developing the technique for clinical use shouldn?t be too difficult because the two substances are already approved for clinical use. ?Our prediction is that it should be as safe as lidocaine,? says co-author Clifford Woolf, an anaesthesiologist at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. ?We think this could lead to a new therapeutic advance quite rapidly.? Bean believes that a few refinements could make the technique even more effective. ?In these initial experiments we used off-the-shelf molecules that we knew about ? there may be other agents that would give longer-lasting anaesthesia,? he says. \n                   Neuroscience@nature.com \n                 \n                   Brain and Behaviour news  \n                 \n                   Bruce Bean?s homepage \n                 \n                   Michael Caterina?s homepage \n                 \n                   Harvard Medical School \n                 Reprints and Permissions"},

Breeding a species in captivity offers a strategy to save threatened populations, but a new study with steelhead trout shows that even a few generations of domestication can hinder the reproductive success of these animals in the wild. Every year, fish hatcheries release more than 5 billion juvenile salmon and steelhead trout in the Pacific Northwest, primarily for harvest purposes. Recently, the practice has been tested as a means to supplement declining wild populations with captive-bred individuals. But after time in captivity, these fish lose their ability to avoid predators and often differ in their mating behaviours. Researchers assumed that such changes required many generations to take hold ? new research now shows that it can happen much more quickly.  \n              Captive at heart \n            In 1991 the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife (ODFW) in Salem began supplementing wild steelhead trout populations in Oregon's Hood River. Every year, wild steelhead are collected on the river, allowed to breed at the nearby Parkdale Hatchery, and their offspring are released a year later. When these fish are ready to spawn, they swim upriver where they are trapped at the Powerdale Dam, which forms a complete barrier across the river. There, project staff catalogue, measure and then sample DNA from almost every adult fish, before releasing them to spawn upstream or returning them below the dam. During 3 years in the late 1990s, large numbers of captive-reared fish returned to the dam and were crossed with wild fish. By comparing reproductive outputs of fish with one wild parent to those with two wild parents, researchers led by Michael Blouin of Oregon State University in Corvallis estimated the consequences of just one generation of captive-rearing. \"What's starkly clear,\" says Blouin, \"is that using hatchery fish to produce another generation of hatchery fish causes a very rapid decline in fitness.\" Simply raising fish in captivity cuts their reproductive success by 15%. As the researchers report in this week's  Science , having one captive parent in addition to being raised in captivity will reduce reproductive success by an additional 45%, thanks to genetic effects.  \n              Downstream effects \n            Scientists working with steelhead agree that the new research could have a lasting impact on management decisions. Barry Berejikian, who runs a project to supplement fish numbers on the Hood Canal for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, says there may be ways to minimize the problem. His project, for instance, does not require artificial spawning. Eggs are collected from the wild, raised in captivity, and released again, without any mating between captive fish. Even so, Berejikian questions whether Blouin's results can be generalized to other captive-bred species. ?I'm yet to be convinced that this is going to be the case for other salmon,\" he says.  Kevin Goodson, a conservation coordinator at the ODFW, agrees that steelhead trout have a unique life history, and does not believe the study will put an immediate end to programs in other fish such as Chinook salmon. \"We've got some situations where there aren't a lot of options,\" he says. Blouin, however, says that his research adds to the weight of previous studies showing fitness losses in hatchery fish. And his findings may not be all bad news. If genetic changes appear so quickly when wild fish are brought into captivity, it may only take a few generations back in the wild for reproductive fitness to recover through natural selection. \"What happens when you add the first generation of hatchery fish to a wild population?\" he asks. \"We don't know yet.\" Reprints and Permissions"},

Fifty years ago, a small aluminium sphere called Sputnik became the first artificial object to orbit Earth. The Soviet Union launched the satellite atop a modified R-7 intercontinental ballistic missile. Once in orbit, four antennas broadcast its now-iconic beeps to the world. As it whizzed around Earth, Sputnik quickly became a symbol of Soviet space superiority. Contrary to popular belief, Soviet politicians didn?t care much about satellites prior to the launch, according to Alexei Kojevnikov, a historian of science at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, Canada. At the time, Soviet leaders were mainly concerned with the development of intercontinental missiles to countervail US bombers stationed close to the USSR?s borders. ?Sputnik was seen as a little distraction,? Kojevnikov says. The project was primarily supported ?as a reward for scientists? and engineers? good work in creating a missile.? Whereas Soviet bureaucrats were initially disinterested in the launch, Western scientists and politicians seized on Sputnik as an icon of a growing ?red menace?. It was ?more proof of growing Communist superiority in the all-important missile field,? Senator Stuart Symington (Democrat, Missouri) told the  New York Times  two days after Sputnik was sent into orbit.  What the Soviets had that the United States didn?t, commentators said, was a strong base of science education, from which achievements such as Sputnik could arise. Without better education in the United States, added US physicist Elmer Hutchisson, ?our way of life is, I am certain, doomed to rapid extinction?.  \n              Secret spy? \n            In the days after the event, prominent scientists such as Fred Whipple argued that Sputnik might be broadcasting secret codes back to Earth, or photographing the planet from space. There was also speculation as to whether satellites could be used to hurl hydrogen bombs at Earth?s surface. The panicky response gave ?street cred? to a nation that, until then, had been seen as scientifically backward, according to Jonathan McDowell, an astronomer at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge, Massachusetts. ?It made the world see the Soviet Union as a technologically competent superpower,? he says. It also led to rapid funding increases for maths and science education in the United States, and the creation of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). Kojevnikov says both were actually moves to emulate strengths of the Soviet system, which encouraged technical education for the masses and depended on heavily centralized bureaucracies to run its space programme. Sputnik?s mission was primarily technological and political, but there was also a scientific component, adds McDowell. By measuring distortions of the satellite?s constant beeping, Soviet physicists could learn about the ionosphere. They also learned about the density of the upper atmosphere when Sputnik fell back to Earth three months later.  Since Sputnik, humankind?s entry into space has gone in leaps and bounds (see Steps into space). Independet of the utility of those steps, philosophically they taught people to believe that anything is possible, McDowell says. ?That, I think, is the great intellectual shift that the space programme has brought us.? \n                   Russian science web focus \n                 \n                   History of Sputnik \n                 Reprints and Permissions"},

Bacteria can sprout webs of electrical wiring that transform the soil into a geological battery, a team of researchers claims. Some soil bacteria form networks of tiny wires linking individual bacterial cells into a web-like electrical circuit, they report (D. Ntarlagiannis  et al .  Geophys. Res. Lett.   34,  L17305; 2007). The wires allow the bacteria to get rid of electrons generated during metabolism, transporting them to distant 'electron dumps'. The earth beneath our feet might act as a gigantic circuit built by microbes to power their metabolic systems, suggests Yuri Gorby, a geochemist previously at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory in Richland, Washington, and now at the J. Craig Venter Institute in La Jolla, California. As the bacteria consume nutrients for energy, they spit out unwanted electrons into the circuit. Last year, Gorby and his colleagues discovered that  Shewanella oneidensis  bacteria can grow long filaments, just 100 nanometres (a hundred millionths of a millimetre) thick, which conduct electricity (Y. A. Gorby  et al .  Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA   103,  11358\u201311363; 2006). The researchers presented evidence that the microbes use these 'nanowires' to shunt electrons produced during metabolic reactions onto the surface of mineral grains in the soil, to be taken up by metal ions. Without an electron acceptor, the bacteria cannot function properly and die. The researchers found that several other bacterial species also produce such nanowires. Oxygen molecules act as convenient electron dumps for bacteria that lie near the soil surface. But little air penetrates to some environments, such as deep lake sediments or waterlogged soils. Now, Gorby and his team think they have found evidence that the bacterial nanowires can link up into a network, conducting electrons to the aerated surface. The researchers filled plastic columns with wet sand infiltrated with a nutrient compound (lactate), and allowed  S. oneidensis  to grow in this 'fake soil'. Only the top of the column was in contact with air. Electrodes inserted at various heights up the columns revealed that, after about ten days, electrical charge was coursing up the column. Gorby's team examined the sand under a microscope and found that it was threaded by a web of filaments between the bacterial cells. These are wires that provide the pathways for electron transport up to the surface, they suggest. In contrast, when the team grew a colony of mutant cells that could spawn only very thin, frail and non-conducting filaments, the electrodes in the column remained uncharged. \u201cThis is a new aspect of microbiology,\u201d says Gorby. \u201cI think we will find that it's a dominant lifestyle for microbes to live in an electrically connected community.\u201d Sediment batteries, which power low-energy devices such as sensors, might unwittingly be exploiting these electric webs, he says. In these devices, electrodes are inserted into underwater sediments to pick up tiny currents generated by microbial activity. \u201cOur work shows how these electrons are being mobilized,\u201d Gorby says. \u201cIf this idea is right, it is really quite remarkable,\u201d says Kenneth Nealson, a geobiologist at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles, who collaborated with Gorby on last year's discovery of microbial nanowires. But not everyone is persuaded by the claim. \u201cI think many of us would like to believe that microbial communities may be hard-wired, because it is just such an attractive and fantastic notion,\u201d says Derek Lovley, a microbiologist at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst. \u201cBut there is just no evidence for it.\u201d He adds that most microbes in anaerobic environments don't need long-distance access to oxygen in order to get rid of the electrons generated when they break down organic matter. Besides, he says, the experiments don't show conclusively that the filaments are acting as wires, nor that this is what allows electrons to move through the system. He thinks the microbes probably shed electrons by releasing soluble electron shuttle molecules, not by passing them along nanowires. \u201cIt is well documented that  Shewanella  releases soluble molecules that act as electron shuttles,\u201d he says. \u201cThe difference between the wild-type and the mutant could be attributed to the mutants' inability to react with a soluble electron shuttle. This is a more plausible explanation.\u201d Bruce Logan, a microbiologist at Pennsylvania State University in University Park, who has worked on microbe-driven sediment batteries, shares such reservations. \u201cI believe they see nanowires, but I see no evidence that a long-distance connection is established here,\u201d he says. \u201cIt may be possible, but these data don't prove it.\u201d \u201cThere are clearly way more questions raised than answered at this point,\u201d Nealson admits. \n                     Microbiology: Batteries not includedCircuits of slime \n                   \n                     Microbiology: Pipe dreams \n                   \n                     Mud battery stops marine rust \n                   \n                     Electrokinetic microchannel battery by means of electrokinetic and microfluidic phenomena \n                   \n                     A miniature biofuel cell operating in a physiological buffer \n                   \n                     Microbial fuel-cell research at Pennsylvania State University \n                   \n                     All about  Shewanella oneidensis \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

As the world marks 20 years since the introduction of the Montreal Protocol to protect the ozone layer,  Nature  has learned of experimental data that threaten to shatter established theories of ozone chemistry. If the data are right, scientists will have to rethink their understanding of how ozone holes are formed and how that relates to climate change. Long-lived chloride compounds from anthropogenic emissions of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) are the main cause of worrying seasonal ozone losses in both hemispheres. In 1985, researchers discovered a hole in the ozone layer above the Antarctic, after atmospheric chloride levels built up. The Montreal Protocol, agreed in 1987 and ratified two years later, stopped the production and consumption of most ozone-destroying chemicals. But many will linger on in the atmosphere for decades to come. How and on what timescales they will break down depend on the molecules' ultraviolet absorption spectrum (the wavelength of light a molecule can absorb), as the energy for the process comes from sunlight. Molecules break down and react at different speeds according to the wavelength available and the temperature, both of which are factored into the protocol. So Markus Rex, an atmosphere scientist at the Alfred Wegener Institute of Polar and Marine Research in Potsdam, Germany, did a double-take when he saw new data for the break-down rate of a crucial molecule, dichlorine peroxide (Cl 2 O 2 ). The rate of photolysis (light-activated splitting) of this molecule reported by chemists at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California 1 , was extremely low in the wavelengths available in the stratosphere \u2014 almost an order of magnitude lower than the currently accepted rate. \u201cThis must have far-reaching consequences,\u201d Rex says. \u201cIf the measurements are correct we can basically no longer say we understand how ozone holes come into being.\u201d What effect the results have on projections of the speed or extent of ozone depletion remains unclear. The rapid photolysis of Cl 2 O 2  is a key reaction in the chemical model of ozone destruction developed 20 years ago 2  (see graphic). If the rate is substantially lower than previously thought, then it would not be possible to create enough aggressive chlorine radicals to explain the observed ozone losses at high latitudes, says Rex. The extent of the discrepancy became apparent only when he incorporated the new photolysis rate into a chemical model of ozone depletion. The result was a shock: at least 60% of ozone destruction at the poles seems to be due to an unknown mechanism, Rex told a meeting of stratosphere researchers in Bremen, Germany, last week. Other groups have yet to confirm the new photolysis rate, but the conundrum is already causing much debate and uncertainty in the ozone research community. \u201cOur understanding of chloride chemistry has really been blown apart,\u201d says John Crowley, an ozone researcher at the Max Planck Institute of Chemistry in Mainz, Germany. \u201cUntil recently everything looked like it fitted nicely,\u201d agrees Neil Harris, an atmosphere scientist who heads the European Ozone Research Coordinating Unit at the University of Cambridge, UK. \u201cNow suddenly it's like a plank has been pulled out of a bridge.\u201d The measurements at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory were overseen by Stanley Sander, a chemist who chairs a NASA panel for data evaluation. Every couple of years, the panel recommends chemical kinetics and photochemical data for use in atmosphere studies. Until the revised photolysis rate has been evaluated, which won't be before the end of next year, \u201cmodellers must make up their minds about what to do,\u201d says Sander. One of the problems with checking the data is that the absorption spectra of chloride compounds are technically challenging to determine. Sander's group used a new technique to synthesize and purify Cl 2 O 2 . To avoid impurities and exclude secondary reactions, the team trapped the molecule at low temperatures, then slowly warmed it up. \u201cReactions in experimental chambers are one thing \u2014 the free atmosphere is something else,\u201d says Joe Farman, one of the scientists who first quantified the ozone hole over Antarctica 3 . \u201cThere's no doubt that ozone disappears at up to 3% a day \u2014 whether or not we completely understand the chemistry.\u201d But he adds that insufficient control of substances such as halon 1301, used as a flame suppressor, and HCFC22, a refrigerant, is a bigger threat to the success of the Montreal Protocol than are models that don't match the observed losses. \n               Hot topic \n             Meanwhile, atmosphere researchers have started to think about how to reconcile observations of ozone depletion with the new chemical models. Several thermal reactions, or combinations of reactions, could fill the gap. Sander's group has started to study possible candidates one by one \u2014 but so far without success. Rex thinks that a chemical pathway involving a Cl 2 O 2  isomer \u2014 a molecule with the same atoms but a different structure \u2014 might be at play. But even if the basic chemical model of ozone destruction is upheld, the temperature dependency of key reactions in the process could be very different \u2014 or even opposite \u2014 from thought. This could have dramatic consequences for the understanding of links between climate change and ozone loss, Rex says. The new measurements raise \u201cintriguing questions\u201d, but don't compromise the Montreal Protocol as such, says John Pyle, an atmosphere researcher at the University of Cambridge. \u201cWe're starting to see the benefits of the protocol, but we need to keep the pressure on.\u201d He says that he finds it \u201cextremely hard to believe\u201d that an unknown mechanism accounts for the bulk of observed ozone losses. Nothing currently suggests that the role of CFCs must be called into question, Rex stresses. \u201cOverwhelming evidence still suggests that anthropogenic emissions of CFCs and halons are the reason for the ozone loss. But we would be on much firmer ground if we could write down the correct chemical reactions.\u201d \n                     Antarctic ozone hole set to take 60 more years to recover \n                   \n                     Poles lose out as ozone levels begin to recover \n                   \n                     Arctic trends scrutinized as chilly winter destroys ozone \n                   \n                     Ozone hits record low in 2005 \n                   \n                     The hole truth \n                   \n                     Earth Sciences \n                   \n                     EU ozone project SCOUT-03 \n                   \n                     Ozone Secretariat of the United Nations Environment Programme \n                   \n                     NOAA Stratospheric Ozone webpage \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

As  Nature  went to press, scientists were scrambling to locate a small capsule from space now believed to be somewhere in Kazakhstan. The capsule is part of an ambitious experimental space-mail delivery system that aimed to use a 30-kilometre-long satellite tether \u2014 the longest yet. In the early hours of 25 September, the ribbon from the satellite orbiting 300 kilometres above Earth was cut and the capsule parachuted to Earth, although off-target. The test forms part of the European Space Agency's Foton-M3 mission, which set out on its 12-day Earth-orbiting science mission on 14 September. Foton-M3 is carrying more than 40 science experiments, including the tether test, called Young Engineers' Satellite 2 (YES2), a \u20ac2.7-million (US$3.8-million) project involving more than 450 students. The idea was to demonstrate the feasibility of a cheap way of returning small objects to Earth from distances similar to that of the International Space Station some 330 kilometres away. Delivering small payloads from low Earth orbits is not as easy as simply dropping them. \u201cYou don't want this object to spin around the Earth,\u201d says Francesco Emma, head of the European Space Agency's education office. The capsule, or any other payload, must slow down so that it can come out of its orbit. This can be done using a retro-rocket, but tethers are another way. \u201cYou can lower the capsule,\u201d says Emma. \u201cWhen it is released it doesn't have enough energy to spin.\u201d The tether, just 0.6 millimetres thick, was made from a super-strong polyethylene fibre called Dyneema and weighed 5.5 kilograms. YES2 consisted of three parts: the 6-kilogram capsule, together with heat shield, that returned to Earth; a carrier that held the capsule in place; and a deployer, bolted to Foton-M3, that held both capsule and carrier and a spool of tether. The capsule was deployed in two stages \u2014 3.5 kilometres of tether was released at first. After the landing location was targeted, the idea was to reel out the rest of the tether. Once the pendulum-like tether and capsule had swung to the vertical, the tether would be cut, and the capsule would parachute to Earth in about 30 minutes. But the rate of cable uncoiling was 5 metres per second, not 12 metres per second as planned, so the cable unwound only 8.5 kilometres, Russian reports suggest \u2014 although this was still the first successful tether mission to Earth. A transmitter on the satellite should allow mission controllers to locate the capsule's landing site. \n                     Space elevator stuck at ground level \n                   \n                     NASA aims high with orbital transport system \n                   \n                     Nature in Focus: Human Space Flight \n                   \n                     ESA's YES2 project \n                   \n                     International Space Station \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Cape town South Africa's mission to create a globally competitive national academy of sciences reached another milestone last week with the announcement of 51 new research chairs. The South African Research Chairs Initiative, launched by the government in December 2006, aims to create 210 research chairs by 2010 in a range of disciplines from nanophotonics to dignity jurisprudence. The government hopes that the scheme will seduce foreign researchers to come to South Africa, as well as encourage the country's top researchers to stay and expatriates to return. Two-thirds of the 72 appointments made so far are people already working in South Africa, but the eventual aim is for 60% of the appointments to come from abroad. To redress the balance, the next round of awards is likely to be confined to applicants from outside the country, says Robin Drennan of South Africa's National Research Foundation, which administers the scheme. But Cheryl de la Rey, deputy vice-chancellor for research at the University of Cape Town, says that the selection process makes it difficult to attract overseas candidates. \u201cIt's not easy to get people to move continents, and a problem with the current procedure is that it takes so long that some foreign-based candidates take up other offers. We must try to improve the turnaround time,\u201d she says. The National Research Foundation's chief executive Mzamo Mangaliso says the selection process will be overhauled to speed it up without compromising quality. \u201cWe hope to empower our universities to recruit suitable candidates in a speedy and focused manner,\u201d he says. Although 14 of the country's 22 universities have been awarded at least one chair, two-thirds of the appointments are concentrated at three universities: the University of Cape Town, the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg and the University of Stellenbosch. Piet Steyn, Stellenbosch's director of research, says that this is unavoidable because a critical mass of researchers is needed as well as access to infrastructure such as experimental facilities and libraries \u2014 which are concentrated within relatively few regions of the country. The chairs, which will cost the state 170 million rand (US$24 million) over the next five years, are a very positive and important intervention, Steyn says. So far, around two-thirds of the incumbents are white, but the initiative aims to have 60% of the places filled by black researchers. One of the advantages of appointments from within the country, says de la Rey, is that universities are obliged, by the terms of the scheme, to fill the new chair-holder's previous post. This can be done at a more junior level, where it is often easier to diversify in terms of ethnicity and gender, she says. Cancer biologist Iqbal Parker of the University of Cape Town, who is director of the newly established International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology there, is delighted with his new research chair. He and Frank Brombacher, another research-chair holder, will head up the centre's first two research programmes \u2014 on non-communicable diseases, which are increasing in Africa, and the immunology of infectious diseases, respectively. Parker says that the main advantage of the scheme is that the research-chair positions incorporate awards of studentships, postdoctoral fellowships and running expenses for five years. \n                     News in brief \n                   \n                     South Africa's research chairs initiative \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Companies are increasingly acknowledging the risks posed by global warming, suggest surveys released on 24 September. The latest Global Corporate Climate Change Report, released by the advocacy group Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) at an event in New York headlined by former US President Bill Clinton, details disclosures of energy costs from more than 1,300 companies around the world (see graphic). The London-based group of institutional investors is campaigning for the right of shareholders to probe the environmental policies of firms in which they invest. It argues that the possibility of real damages from global warming and the almost certain introduction of regulations penalizing emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases mean that climate now poses a material liability to many companies that should be publicly disclosed. CDP is leveraging investor pressure to push for voluntary disclosure, but others have opted for brute force. New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo issued subpoenas on 14 September for internal documents from five companies planning to build new coal-fired power plants, questioning whether they have fully disclosed the financial risks of increasing their greenhouse-gas emissions. Ceres, a coalition of environmentalists and investors, and Environmental Defense, a non-profit organization based in New York, followed up days later with a petition to the US Securities and Exchange Commission seeking to increase financial disclosure requirements on corporate exposure to 'climate risk'. On Monday, Wal-Mart announced that it intends to ask its suppliers for the energy costs involved in manufacturing seven of its product lines. The retail chain will then work with CDP to translate this information into greenhouse-gas emission figures. \u201cIt will be money coordinated through Wall Street that builds the energy-efficient economy of the twenty-first century,\u201d says CDP head Paul Dickinson. \u201cThere are risks, but there are also big opportunities.\u201d CDP asked firms to assess the risks \u2014 and opportunities \u2014 presented by global warming, and to describe any strategies being used to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions. The survey, signed by more than 300 institutional investors managing some US$41 trillion in assets, found that 76% of respondents reported implementation of a programme to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions, compared with 48% a year ago. The percentages of respondents who thought global warming posed an economic threat and of those who believed it offered opportunities were roughly equal, at 79% and 82%, respectively. This is the fifth annual report by CDP, and the statistics indicate some success: 77% of the world's 500 largest companies responded, compared with 47% in 2002. European firms led the way with 83% participating. North American firms gained some ground with a 74% response rate, compared with 66% last year.

The tricky word 'embryonic' is to be removed from the name of the US Human Embryonic Stem Cell Registry, the National Institutes of Health announced last week. It will be renamed the Human Pluripotent Stem Cell Registry. The change results from an executive order issued by President George W. Bush after he vetoed legislation that would have lifted some restrictions on federal funding for human embryonic stem-cell research (see  Nature  doi:10.1038/news070618-13; 2007 ). The order was widely viewed as an attempt to downplay the potential of human embryonic stem cells. Even its title is politically charged: \u201cExpanding Approved Stem Cell Lines in Ethically Responsible Ways.\u201d But Charis Thompson, a professor of rhetoric and a member of the Berkeley Stem Cell Center in California, says both sides play at that game: advocates of embryonic stem-cell research avoid using terms such as 'embryo' and 'cloning', she observes. \u201cThis kind of linguistic deflation of public anxiety is a hallmark of moving ahead in this field in the United States and will only intensify,\u201d Thompson says. Besides removing 'embryonic' from the names of the cell lines that can receive federal research funding \u2014 as instructed in the executive order \u2014 the 18 September announcement sets out a strategy of awarding grants to create cell lines without the involvement of embryos, adding more funds to existing grants and \u201caggressively pursuing an assessment of the potential of alternative sources of pluripotent stem-cell lines\u201d. This rankles with many scientists working to create pluripotent stem-cell lines, who say that such an assessment is not possible without research on newly derived embryonic stem-cell lines. \u201cIt's not an alternative; these are complementary technologies,\u201d says Rudolf Jaenisch at the Whitehead Institute in Cambridge, Massachusetts, who is working to reprogramme non-embryonic cells to be as flexible as embryonic stem cells. One problem is that pluripotency is a notoriously imprecise term. Not even human embryonic stem cells have been established as pluripotent, as researchers have yet to establish their ability to become all human cell types, says Glyn Stacey, head of the UK Stem Cell Bank in Hertfordshire, which handles stem-cell lines created from embryos as well as those derived from fetal and adult tissues. The first non-embryonic stem-cell lines could be added to the registry in the next few months.

Disgraced South Korean cloning scientist Woo Suk Hwang has set up a research base in Thailand, according to reports from South Korea last week. Science-policy officials in Thailand say they are worried about the reports, as they knew nothing about this. Se Pil Park, a fertility expert at Cheju National University in South Korea, says Hwang and ten colleagues have gone to Thailand to carry out cloning experiments involving the transfer of human DNA into eggs from cows, pigs and other animals. The resulting embryos cannot produce viable offspring, but might result in embryonic stem-cell lines that could be cultured for research and for therapeutic use. In 2004, Hwang claimed to have produced embryonic stem cells by cloning human DNA using human eggs. But the data behind these claims were found to have been fabricated. Park would not disclose details of the researcher's latest work, nor where he was based. Hwang, who remains on trial for fraud, embezzlement and violation of a bioethics law related to his discredited experiments, lost his licence to do research with human eggs. According to Park, Hwang went to Thailand to carry out interspecies cloning because he thought he would face opposition from ethicists in his home country. In Thailand, human reproductive cloning was made illegal in 2002, but there are currently no laws regulating therapeutic cloning involving human DNA or interspecies cloning. According to Thai veterinary scientist Pradon Chatikavanij, proposed regulations on animal experimentation now before the main legislative body, the Council of State, might restrict interspecies cloning, although no decision on this has yet been made. Chatikavanij is the former head of and now a consultant for the National Research Council of Thailand, which is in charge of drafting the regulations. Chatikavanij says the Thai government knows nothing about any research being done by Hwang in Thailand. \u201cWe should know what they are doing.

Researchers have long scratched their heads over how some aquatic bugs and microorganisms come to be enclosed in amber.  Amber is formed from tree resin, and aquatic organisms are ? as their name implies ? usually found in the water. Assuming that tree resin hardens on the tree, it isn't obvious how water-loving creatures get trapped inside. There have been theories that perhaps resin still flowing in trees with water-logged holes might trap some organisms or that the dried-out remains of aquatic creatures might blow into blobs of resin on the wind. Now, Alexander Schmidt from the Museum of Natural History in Berlin, in Germany and David Dilcher of the University of Florida in Gainsville have knocked these ideas out of the water by proving a simpler theory. For trees standing in water, they show, resin dropping into the water stays firm enough to retain its shape and act as a trap, but soft enough for an insect to wander wander through the shell of the hydrophobic resin blob 1 . \"It is so logical and easy an answer that we didn?t think of it,\" says Michael Balke of the Bavarian State Collection of Zoology in Munich, a researcher specializing in the taxonomy of aquatic insects who has wrestled with this question before. \"[This] provides an easy and very plausible answer to how insects get caught in resin.\"  \n              Swamp solution \n            The researchers didn?t have to go far to find a forest where they could test their idea: Dilcher owns some land in Florida with a bit of a swamp on it. The two researchers set to work, cutting some trees standing in water to induce a resin flow, and then watching what happened. When the resin reached the water line, some spread out and floated on the water. The majority of the resin, however, slid all the way down to the floor of the pond as pillow-shaped blobs. These formed a thin hard shell after a few days, but remained liquid inside.  The researchers found that small microorganisms could penetrate the blob before its hard shell formed and largish insects that blundered into the blob could break through the shell to get stuck inside. ?People thought it was very hard to get tiny soft-bodied organisms into the resin,? says Schmidt.  The team collected a menagerie of Florida swamp-dwellers in their resin, which hardened as the summer wore on and the water dried up, exposing the resin to the air. Along with water beetles (pictured), algae, diatoms, flagellated microorganisms, nematodes and mites, the researchers report finding fungi and bacteria actually growing inside the resin ? at least until it solidified. \n                   Evolution & Ecology  \n                 \n                   Baltic amber inclusions \n                 Reprints and Permissions"},

A major US experiment that might open a more commercially attractive route to fusion is facing the prospect of closure after running into heavy cost overruns and scheduling delays. On 15 September, a panel of independent scientists travelled to Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory in New Jersey to determine whether to shut down the National Compact Stellarator Experiment (NCSX). Raymond Orbach, the Department of Energy's undersecretary for science, called for the review after discovering that the project was nearly US$40 million over budget and two years behind schedule. ?Given the magnitude of the increases projected,? Orbach wrote in a 9 August letter to the panel, ?all options, including termination of the project, must be considered.? Whereas nuclear fission derives its energy from the splitting of heavy nuclei such as uranium, fusion produces energy from the fusing of lightweight elements, usually hydrogen isotopes. The dream is to produce energy from abundant materials such as sea-water without generating long-lived radioactive waste. Most of the world's current efforts to show that fusion could be a feasible energy option is focused on ITER, a massive reactor now under construction in Cadarache, France, and slated to cost $6 billion in construction and $6 billion in operating costs until 2026. (See box) Fusion only takes place when hydrogen is heated to hundreds of millions of degrees to form a plasma, and so fusion reactors must contain their hydrogen fuel inside a magnetic field. ITER's design, known as a tokamak, will generate that field by a combination of external superconducting magnets and an internal current through the core (see  Nature   436 , 318; 2005). This design is relatively simple to build, but the internal current can disrupt the confinement.  The Princeton experiment hopes to get round those problems using an alternative set-up called a stellarator. Unlike tokamaks, stellarators use only external magnets to confine the plasma. The lack of an internal current makes the plasma more stable and, in theory at least, allows stellarators to run for longer than tokamaks. Stellarators cannot yet operate at the temperatures and pressures of tokamaks, but the results of early experiments are impressive: a Japanese stellarator known as the Large Helical Device, in Toki City, has held its plasma for more than an hour. Current tokamaks, by contrast, can hold their plasmas for a few minutes at most. But the promise of stability comes at a cost, says Thomas Klinger of the Max Planck Institute for Plasma Physics in Greifswald, Germany. To hold plasma without an internal current requires much more complex magnetic-field geometry. That must be created with unusually shaped magnetic coils, which are difficult to manufacture. ?A stellarator is much simpler to operate, but much more difficult to build,? he says. Construction seems to be at the core of the NCSX's woes. The project was originally budgeted at about $92 million with completion in 2009, but a review this July found that costs had ballooned to $130 million and completion date had been pushed back to 2011. ?As we came into the assembly phase, it turned out to be more complicated than we anticipated,? says Stewart Smith, dean of research at Princeton University, which oversees the lab and the experiment. Smith declined to comment further on the reasons for the delay, except to say that the cost underestimation was being taken ?very seriously?. The review of the NCSX comes at a crucial time for the US fusion programme, according to Stephen Dean, the head of Fusion Power Associates, a non-profit group in Washington, Seattle, that advocates the development of fusion. The fusion-research community has long feared that US participation in ITER would starve other programmes of funds. As all planned fusion budget increases are to go towards the American contribution to ITER, that leaves no contingency for cost overruns in other programmes such as the NCSX, says Dean. ?I think there's a fair possibility that the Department of Energy will cancel the programme,? he says. ?In my opinion, that would be a sin,? says Klinger, who heads Wendelstein 7-X, a ?300-million ($416 million) German stellarator project under construction in Greifswald. Unlike the German reactor, the NCSX was to use a unique hybrid of stellarator and tokamak technology. If it worked, Klinger says, it could lead to tokamaks that could operate continuously, which would be far more commercially attractive than the ITER design. ?It is a very important experiment,? he says. The fate of the programme will probably be determined after the current review is completed. The committee is expected to deliver its report at the end of October. \n                     NCSX \n                   \n                     ITER \n                   \n                     KSTAR \n                   \n                     Orbach's Letter \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

A week after a series of powerful earthquakes rocked Indonesia, killing more than 20 people, geologists are warning that \u201cthe big one\u201d may be yet to come. The region might still hold enough energy to release a magnitude-9.0 tremor that could produce a deadly tsunami, echoing the 2004 tsunami that killed more than 230,000 people in southeast Asia. The trio of quakes, of magnitudes 8.4, 7.9 and 7.0, occurred off the coast of Padang in southwest Sumatra on 12 and 13 September, along a subduction zone where the Australian tectonic plate dives under the Sunda plate. The plates are sliding past each other, but in some patches they stick, building pressure, which is released when the plates slip in an earthquake. Last week's earthquakes released pressure from a 700-kilometre-long region, known as the Mentawai section, which had been building since the last quake, an event of magnitude 8.6\u20138.9 in 1833. Kerry Sieh, an earthquake geologist at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, has spent the past 15 years studying the history of Indonesian earthquakes from the patterns the tremors leave in coral growth. His data suggest that this area has ruptured every 200 to 230 years since the fourteenth century. Based on Sieh's study of the uplift of fossil corals, a preliminary analysis suggests that last week the plates slipped far less (around 2 metres) than they did in 1833 (10\u201318 metres). If that is the case, not all the pressure may have been released, and part of last week's rupture zone could 're-rupture' in conjunction with a 200-kilometre patch off the coast of Padang (see image) that has not ruptured since 1797. That would produce a magnitude-9.0 quake, he says \u2014 enough to spawn a deadly tsunami. Jim Mori, an earthquake specialist at Kyoto University's Disaster Prevention Research Institute, says Sieh's 'seismic gap' theory is plausible. \u201cIt is similar to the geological trough at Nankai in Japan in that earthquakes are now expected where they have not occurred in a long time,\u201d he says.

Damaged by divers, pollution and climate change, coral reefs may soon be protected through debt forgiveness. The US Congress is expected to approve a bill that would cancel foreign debt in developing countries in exchange for coral reef and rainforest conservation.

The full Senate and House of Representatives should take up the bill soon, and it could reach President George W. Bush ? a supporter ? by the end of 2007, says Mark Helmke, a senior adviser for Senator Richard Lugar (Republican, Indiana), one of the bill's sponsors. The bill provides $75 million to pay off debts owed to the United States over the next three years. Congress passed a similar bill in 1998 that has channelled $137 million to protect rainforests in developing countries such as Panama, Bangladesh and Botswana. Under the deal, countries in debt to the US Agency for International Development give money to local conservation groups. In return, the United States cancels the same amount of debt. For example, in 2003, the US government cancelled $10 million in debt owed by Panama to protect the Chagres National Park. The money is being spent on projects such as park-boundary enforcement to stem illegal farming and training locals as ecotourist guides. Indonesia is likely to be the first country to take up the debt-for-coral swap. Its Coral Triangle, home to more than 600 species of coral and 3,000 species of fish, is under threat from pollution, overfishing and bleaching ? a situation exacerbated by global warming. ?Corals are in a tricky position because of climate change,? says Lara Hansen, chief scientist for climate change with the conservation group WWF in Washington DC, which has helped to broker rainforest protection. ?Even if you protect a coral spatially, you still have this massive threat.?

Field upon field of beautiful blooms belie a dark legacy that wends a destructive path from the growing fields of Afghanistan to individuals in cities thousands of miles away. Yet opium and its derivate heroin are the biggest cash exports in a country ravaged by war ? the livelihoods of whole communities depend on the crop, which represents more than 40% of the country's gross domestic product. And it's not just Afghan villagers earning from the crops ? insurgents, warlords, the Taliban and terrorist groups obtain a large part of their funding through trade in illicit narcotics, according to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), headquartered in Vienna, Austria. The nation's opium production ? accounting for 93% of global illegal production ? exceeds the world's demand for illicit opiates by more than 3,000 tonnes, according to a UNODC report released last month. Opium poppy ( Papaver somniferum ) cultivation in Afghanistan is up 17% on last year, to 193,000 hectares. Good weather meant that each hectare yielded more opium ? the crop in 2007 was up by more than one-third from 2006. It is an attractive crop for farmers in times of insecurity ? opium lasts for a long time without spoiling, unlike other perishables. And, of course, it attracts high prices. In 2007 the average 'farm-gate' price of opium was US$122 per kilogram. The southern province of Helmand, where there is little security and Taliban insurgents exert a huge influence, is now the world's biggest supplier of illicit drugs ? the total opium income for farmers in that province was $528 million. In 2006, according to the US state department, the export value of opium from Afghanistan was $3.1 billion (for 6,100 tonnes), but by the time it reaches the streets of London, UK, for example, its price rises to about \u00a320 billion ($38 billion). Internationally, the consensus is that the situation is at crisis point, but there remains intense disagreement on the best course of action. The United Nations and the Afghan government have both called for assistance from North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) troops to help to eradicate poppies. But last week NATO reiterated its opposition to direct action, saying: ?The NATO International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) does not allow for ISAF to be directly involved in poppy eradication.? Many fear that the sight of NATO troops ripping up crops would damage relations with ordinary Afghans and drive them towards the Taliban.  \n                To spray or not to spray? \n              So what should be done? Many argue that indiscriminate aerial crop-spraying will be the only effective option. ?Very strong pressure is now building up in favour of aerial eradication,? UNODC's executive director, Antonio Maria Costa said recently. The United States also strongly supports this stance, and is leading the push to spray the growing poppy fields. But Afghan president Hamid Karzai is opposed to the idea. However, in a direct contradiction, Ahmad Zia Massoud, one of Afghanistan's vice-presidents, recently called for spraying. His view is not shared by a number of other bodies. ?We are against the policy of aerial spraying,? says the British Embassy in Afghanistan's counter-narcotics expert. ?We would likely be handing the insurgents a propaganda tool.? Every subsequent birth defect, or ?two-headed cow? would immediately be blamed on the spraying, he argues. With the population so financially dependent on the crop, international bodies are increasingly looking at alternatives to eradication to address the illicit drugs trade problem, including introducing a legal, licensing scheme. On 12 September, the European Parliament's Committee on Foreign Affairs issued a report calling for its council to put a proposal to the Afghan government for turning part of the poppy crop into legal analgesics, such as morphine and codeine. The Senlis Council, an international think tank with an office in Kabul, has its own scheme, called the Poppy for Medicine programme, which would give control of opium production to local communities, and would license them to produce morphine powder from their crop. ?It's not just a policy choice, it symbolizes what sort of relationship you want to have with the Afghan people,? says Norine MacDonald, president of the scheme. Opium-licensing schemes in Turkey, introduced in the 1970s, and a longer-running scheme in India have proved successful, MacDonald points out.  \n                Law and order needed \n              But the proposal has its critics. ?Legalizing is not an option,? says Susan Pittman, from the US state department. And the British agree: ?In order to have licit cultivation you need to have law and order?, and Afghanistan is not in that situation. ?You'd be putting the Afghanistan government in competition with the narcotics traders,? the British Embassy spokesman says. The Embassy's view is that producing morphine in Afghanistan would be uneconomic because of cheaper fertilizers and automated systems in other countries. The Senlis Council claims that in its Poppy for Medicine schemes, groups of farmers would sell their morphine to the Afghan government for $3,100 per kilogram ? a significant mark-up on the current gate-price of opium ? and the government could then sell it on for $4,300 per kilogram. Opium is first processed to a crude morphine base, morphine hydrochloride. This can then be converted to either morphine powder, or heroin (see 'From flower to needle'). To produce 1 kilogram of morphine takes around 8 kilograms of opium. According to the UNODC, this year's opium crop in Afghanistan ? 8,200 tonnes ? would produce 1,170 tonnes of heroin. Most of Afghanistan's opium is converted to heroin within the country, mainly in labs set up near the border with Iran. Surveyors reports showed that the number of these labs increased in 2007. The trafficking process includes bringing the chemicals needed to convert opium to heroin into Afghanistan. Under the Senlis Council proposal labs would be set up locally to produce morphine powder directly. One of the Poppy for Medicine programme's strongest arguments is the need to provide painkillers to countries where there is a shortage, including Afghanistan itself. In North America, average annual morphine consumption is 55 milligrams per person, in north Africa and the Middle East this plummets to 0.29 milligrams per person, and in the Asia Pacific region it is 0.67 milligrams per person. ?Afghans don't know what painkillers are; it's a rich person's idea,? says MacDonald, who says that there is a large unmet need for painkillers. But the British Embassy counter-narcotics expert says that this is a misconception. ?There may be fundamental problems with supply,? he says, and problems with distribution, but ?there is not a worldwide morphine shortage.? ?For the past two decades morphine has been available in sufficient quantities at the global level to cover the demand,? says Margarethe Ehrenfeldner from the International Narcotics Control Board (INCB) in Vienna, Austria. That morphine comes from licit opium, produced mainly in India, Turkey, Australia, France, Spain and the United Kingdom. GlaxoSmithKline, for example, supplies 25% of the world's medicinal opiates from poppies grown in Tasmania in Australia. But the Senlis Council claims that the INCB's data are skewed. It says that the market demand defined by the INCB is not the same as the actual need for morphine and other poppy-derived medicines, such as codeine. The need for morphine in developing countries is underestimated because of a self-perpetuating cycle of under-prescription and inhibitory import regulations, the Senlis Council says. And Ehrenfeldner admits that some governments report low levels of morphine consumption. ?The INCB and WHO are taking measures to increase accessibility of analgesics worldwide,? she says, ?however, this cannot be accomplished in the short run.? The Senlis Council had hoped to have its pilot scheme up and running by the October growing season, but this is looking ?unlikely?, it now says. The plan for a new Afghan industry in legal opium production could be thrown into jeopardy if aerial spraying is carried out during the February 2008 harvest. ?The deal was essentially that if cultivation was up next season on 2007's, the United States would absolutely spray this coming year,? says Senlis's Brigitte Scheffer. \n                     British Embassy, Kabul \n                   \n                     Afghanistan National Drug Control Strategy \n                   \n                     UNODC Afghanistan Opium Survey 2007 \n                   \n                     US counter narcotics strategy for Afghanistan \n                   \n                     The Senlis Council \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

The previous record minimum was 5.32 million square kilometres, set in 2005, but this year it has already reached a low of 4.24 million square kilometres, according to the US National Snow and Ice Data Center in Boulder, Colorado.

A patient with arthritis who died in July during a gene-therapy trial may have succumbed to an infection she had before the viral vector was administered, experts said on Monday at a meeting of an advisory panel in Bethesda, Maryland, investigating the incident. Little of the evidence presented to the panel seemed to indicate that the injected viral vector had a key role in 36-year-old Jolee Mohr's demise. Although DNA sequences from the vector were found in her liver and spleen, \u201cthe detection of the sample is very low and below the limit of quantification in these assays\u201d, said Jeffrey Bartlett, a member of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee (RAC). \u201cIt really indicates the absence of ongoing replication of the vector in these tissues.\u201d The panel is still awaiting the results of tests on Mohr's tissue samples, expected by December, and the results of blood studies looking for the vector and protein produced by the transgene. It will then reach a firmer conclusion about whether the gene therapy she received three weeks before her death was in any way responsible for it. But even with all the information in hand, \u201cthere will I think still be some uncertainty\u201d, said RAC chair Howard Federoff. Mohr died on 24 July, 22 days after her right knee was injected with an adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector made by Targeted Genetics, a Seattle company. This vector was engineered to contain a gene for an anti-inflammatory protein, TNFR:Fc, which inhibits tumour-necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1). TNF-\u03b1 causes inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis. Autopsy results and the clinical history of the patient presented at the 17 September meeting indicated that the immediate cause of her death was massive bleeding of unknown origin in the tissue space behind the kidneys. This displaced her abdominal organs and ultimately compressed her lungs, making them unable to function. She was also overwhelmingly infected with histoplasmosis, an environmental fungus that can cause serious infections in immunocompromised individuals. She began to feel ill with fatigue and a low-grade fever three days before the gene therapy was administered, the panel heard. TNFR:Fc suppresses the immune system, and so it is possible that the gene therapy caused the infection. However, the design of the trial, in which some patients were also taking similarly acting immunosuppressant drugs, means that it will be difficult to ascertain what caused the infection to take hold. Mohr was also taking a TNF-\u03b1-inhibitor drug for the arthritis, which suppresses the immune system. Carol Kauffman, an infectious-disease specialist at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, told the panel that overwhelming histoplasmosis infection had killed several patients taking such TNF-inhibitory drugs. Of the 871 gene-therapy trials registered with the NIH, 4% have used AAV. Officials at the NIH and the US Food and Drug Administration reported at the meeting that they had reviewed all the AAV trials to date and found no pattern of adverse events associated with AAV, or any increased incidence of adverse events compared with trials using other gene-therapy vectors. The trial Mohr took part in was unusual in that it involved repeated injections. It was halted after her death. \n                     https://doi.org/10.1038/nm0907-999 \n                   \n                     https://doi.org/10.1038/nm0907-1008 \n                   \n                     https://doi.org/10.1038/news070820-1 \n                   \n                     Biotechnology@nature.com \n                   \n                     Drug Discovery@nature.com \n                   \n                     Immunology@nature.com \n                   \n                     Nature Insight: Infection and Immunity (July 2004) \n                   \n                     Nature Insight: Human Genomics and Medicine (May 2004) \n                   \n                     Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee September 17 meeting agenda \n                   \n                     Targeted Genetics press release responding to September 17 RAC meeting \n                   \n                     Targeted Genetics graphic describing mechanism of action of its gene therapy \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

A young Russian biologist who was taking samples to a collaborative institute in France has been accused of attempting to smuggle bioweapons by Russia's federal security service, the FSB. He has been interrogated repeatedly by FSB agents and prevented from leaving the country. His job also now looks uncertain. But experts say that the accusations are absurd. Oleg Mediannikov's Kafkaesque nightmare began on 12 December 2006 at Moscow's Sheremetyevo airport, as he was about to board a plane to Marseilles. Customs officials confiscated 20 phials containing non-pathogenic strains of a typhus vaccine approved by the Russian health ministry for export to France, along with Mediannikov's computer and USB memory sticks. Mediannikov initially thought there was a minor problem with the paperwork. But more than eight months on, the interrogations continue. Mediannikov, who works at the Gamelaya Institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology in Moscow, studies  Rickettsia prowazekii , the bacterium spread by lice that causes epidemic typhus. The institute's laboratory of rickettsial ecology, headed by Irina Tarasevich, has a long-established collaboration with the Rickettsial Unit of the University of the Mediterranean in Marseilles, led by Didier Raoult. The two institutes are World Health Organization Collaborating Centres for Rickettsial Reference and Research. Raoult planned to compare the protein spectrum of two strains of  R. prowazekii  \u2014 Madrid E and EVir \u2014 produced more than 20 years ago in chicken embryos in Russia and since held at the Gamelaya Institute, with similar strains produced more recently in France from mammalian cell cultures. Both strains are not considered to be virulent and are used in vaccinations against typhus. The work is part of a larger research project on the pathogenesis of  R. prowazekii , led by Raoult and funded by France's basic-research agency, the CNRS. Mediannikov was allowed to continue his trip to Marseilles without the samples. On his return to Moscow in January, he was told that the confiscated material had been sent to a secret laboratory \u2014 code-named the 47th military research institute \u2014 for an 'expert assessment'. Three weeks later he was told that an additional assessment \u2014 the first allegedly concluded the materials were benign \u2014 was necessary before the materials could be returned. This second assessment is still pending. But the situation is causing other problems for Mediannikov. On 13 February, he intended to go on a tourist trip to Cameroon, only to learn at Moscow's Domodedovo airport that there was an official order preventing him from leaving the country. When he demanded an explanation, a customs official said the order \u201cmust not be discussed\u201d. His passport was confiscated and returned two months later by regular post. All his efforts to clarify the situation have proved fruitless. In early June, customs informed him that the FSB \u2014 successor to the Soviet KGB \u2014 insisted on initiating criminal proceedings. To avert prosecution, he gave them the valid export permission signed by the deputy health minister. In addition, he presented letters from Tarasevich and Raoult attesting to the harmlessness of the strains and their sole use for scientific purposes. Nonetheless, criminal proceedings were initiated on 26 June \u2014 and the accusations are severe. The indictment, of which  Nature  has obtained a copy, cites Article 188/2 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation on smuggling materials that might be used for preparing weapons of mass destruction. People guilty of illicit trafficking of weapons-delivery systems can be sentenced to up to seven years in prison. Raoult says that he is stunned. \u201cSomething like this has never happened in 20 years of our centres' collaboration,\u201d he says. \u201cOleg spent two years working in my lab. He is a very good, dynamic and responsible scientist.\u201d His work has been instrumental in helping fight typhus in Russia, he adds. Typhus bacteria are not considered potential bioterrorism agents by other governments. \u201cIt is a terrible disease, but the agent is so difficult to grow that it doesn't make any sense to use it for bioweapons,\u201d says Raoult. This week, Mediannikov told  Nature  that the deputy director of his institute had been approached by the FSB and that Mediannikov has now been told to resign or face the sack. \n               On the up \n             Mediannikov's case illustrates a worrying resurgence in Russian scientists being accused of wrong-doing. In 2000, for example, thermo-physicist Valentin Danilov of Krasnoyarsk State Technical University was arrested for allegedly passing classified information to China. He was acquitted in 2003, but taken into custody again after the Russian Supreme Court overturned the acquittal in 2004. And in 2004, Igor Sutyagin, a social scientist formerly with the US and Canada Institute in Moscow, was sentenced to 15 years in a labour camp for allegedly passing classified data on nuclear submarines and missile-warning systems to a British company. The FSB also suspected chemist Oleg Korobeinichev, head of the laboratory of chemical kinetics and combustion in Novosibirsk, of having divulged state secrets to the United States. But the charges were dropped in June 2006, and Korobeinichev received a public apology from local legal authorities. On 27 August, the FSB finally withdrew the charges against physicists Oleg and Igor Minin, who had been accused of revealing state secrets. \u201cThere have been worse times in this country,\u201d says a Russian expert on non-proliferation on condition of anonymity. \u201cBut Vladimir Putin has untied the hands of the FSB, and we do see a trend here towards strengthening state control over all spheres of life, including science.\u201d In May, the FSB warned in a secret report to President Putin that biological samples taken from Russians could be used abroad to produce 'genetic weapons'. Consequently, the export of human specimens was temporarily banned. The order was reversed two weeks later after an outcry in the media and the scientific community. \u201cPublicity does help in such cases,\u201d says Konstantin Severinov, a biochemist who has a joint affiliation at the Institute of Molecular Genetics in Moscow and at Rutgers University in New Jersey. Severinov was himself 'interviewed' by an FSB official in June. \u201cI told the guy straight away that the whole genetic-weapon craze is nothing but lunacy and paranoia,\u201d he says. Over the past couple of months, Mediannikov has been summoned six times to the FSB interrogation department in Moscow. Interviews \u2014 about his biography, scientific advisers, collaborators, research, and so on \u2014 lasted for up to four hours, but took place in a \u201cquite pleasant\u201d atmosphere, he says. Mediannikov is now waiting for the result of the second expert assessment. \u201cIf there's anything in it that might back the charge we will insist on a third, independent assessment,\u201d he says. \u201cIf things get worse, we will also demand that the FSB interrogates the deputy health minister, who approved the export of the material.\u201d He points out that scientists from the Gamelaya Institute have previously taken similar samples to France without any problems. One customs officer, Mediannikov says, hinted to him that customs were \u201cordered\u201d by the FSB to take action against him. And Severinov says that Mediannikov might have been shopped to the FSB by an over-zealous member of his institute's 'first department'. These notorious 'security' departments are obligatory at Russian research institutes \u2014 a relic of Soviet times \u2014 and they maintain close connections with the FSB. Mediannikov's situation is serious, as is always the case when FSB investigators are involved, say legal experts. But if convicted only of 'ordinary' smuggling, he may yet get away with a modest penalty fee, they say. A date for the trial has not been set. He is not in custody, but experts doubt that he would be allowed to leave Russia as long as the investigation continues. \n                     Guilty, but no jail sentence for Russian scientist \n                   \n                     Scientists decry 'spy' verdict for Russian physicist \n                   \n                     Russian scientists face long fight for justice \n                   \n                     University of the Mediterranean, Maseilles, Rickettsiological Unit \n                   \n                     WHO Collaborating Centres \n                   \n                     Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation (Wikipedia Article) \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

The next head of the UK Medical Research Council (MRC) has been chosen, potentially bringing to a close a period of significant unrest within the organization.  Nature  has learned that the government's biomedical research organization will appoint Leszek Borysiewicz as successor to its current chief executive Colin Blakemore when he steps down at the end of this month. Borysiewicz, who is currently deputy rector at Imperial College London, has a clinical-sciences background and is currently co-chair of the MRC's advisory group on stem-cell research. He will take charge of the MRC's \u00a3460-million (US$933-million) annual research budget \u2014 perhaps more, if a government decision to increase the MRC's spending power is announced as expected later this year.  \u201cI hope that there will be a substantial increase in the MRC's budget,\u201d says Blakemore. \u201cIt is important for the MRC to sustain its investment in fundamental research, as well as having funds to expand.\u201d  Borysiewicz will inherit an organization whose scientists are beset with doubts about their future. Last year's government-commissioned review of the MRC's goals by venture capitalist and former Wellcome Trust governor David Cooksey called for the council to pursue an agenda of 'translational research' \u2014 biomedical research more strongly focused on health benefits and the economic bottom line. The review voiced economists' and executives' fears that, despite the MRC's impressive track record of medical discoveries such as cancer drugs and monoclonal antibodies, it has failed in the past to maximize the clinical impact and reap the cash rewards its innovations deserve. But the new agenda has left MRC-funded scientists worried that basic research will be left out in the cold. \u201cI'm a lot more confident than I was six months ago that the MRC will not have to reduce its commitment to fundamental research or the breadth of its portfolio, and, in addition, that it will be given the ability to transform discoveries into valuable applications more efficiently,\u201d Blakemore told  Nature . Critics of the translational research agenda are anxious that the new appointee should not stifle basic research. \u201cWe need someone committed to making sure that 'blue sky' research funding is maintained,\u201d says Hilary Leevers, acting director of the Campaign for Science and Engineering in the UK. \u201cWe need to make sure science is balanced.\u201d With a strong basic research background that has also yielded clinical benefits such as vaccines, Borysiewicz looks well placed to deliver on this balancing act. The process of selecting a new chief executive has also suffered controversy, with doubts about the suitability of MRC chairman John Chisholm \u2014 appointed last year to lead the search for a new chief executive \u2014 to select the right candidate. In July, the Commons Science and Technology Committee said that it had \u201cserious reservations as to whether Sir John is the right person to guide the MRC executive through the coming period of change\u201d. Chisholm previously presided over the spin-out of the government's defence research agency to form a profit-making company called QinetiQ. At the MRC, he was appointed as a non-executive chairman with no involvement in the council's decision on where to direct funds, but rumours have persisted that more than one well-qualified candidate has been discouraged from applying for the role of chief executive owing to fears of interference in such decisions. Blakemore says he was not aware of candidates declining to apply, adding that \u201cI am very confident that the next chief executive will be expected to be a strong scientific leader of the MRC\u201d. Although Blakemore claims that he has no certain knowledge of who will replace him, he says \u201cI hope that we will have a new chief executive in post shortly after my departure. \u201d He adds that selecting a chief executive from a clinical background would potentially be a good strategic move. \u201cThe most important thing is that the MRC should, and I think will, maintain its quality of judgement in supporting the very best biomedical research in the UK,\u201d Blakemore says. Most observers of British science agree that the translational research agenda is a necessary and pragmatic new direction, providing that basic science does not suffer unduly. This was a widespread fear when Blakemore announced his intention to leave earlier this year. \u201cWe hope the agenda can be implemented without losing research quality,\u201d says Royal Society president Martin Rees. \u201cThe appointment of someone of high standing and professional reputation is crucial.\u201d Borysiewicz, described by Rees as a \u201cdistinguished figure\u201d, has a research background focused on viruses and immunology. In 2001 he received a knighthood for his work on developing a range of vaccines, including the vaccine against human papilloma virus aimed at preventing cervical cancer. A popular figure among students and researchers at Imperial College, Borysiewicz is responsible for the college's overall scientific and academic direction. He has embraced applied research, particularly in establishing the Schistosomiasis Control Initiative, which was funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Another influential British science policy job also looks to have been given to a candidate from Imperial College. John Beddington, a biological economist and political adviser on fisheries, is to be asked to become the British government's new chief science adviser, replacing David King when he finishes his eight-year tenure at the end of this year. The Department of Innovation, Universities and Skills is expected to make a formal announcement shortly. With a background in environmental and fisheries research, Beddington is well-versed in the issues that look set to dominate government science policy during the next few years. \u201cWe at the Royal Society feel he's an excellent choice,\u201d says Rees. \n                     UK science reshuffled \n                   \n                     Biomedical research chief departs as reforms loom \n                   \n                     UK civil servants accused of warping science \n                   \n                     Inquiry hears claim of threats over lab move \n                   \n                     Allegations fly over fate of UK medical research institute \n                   \n                     Health and medicine news \n                   \n                     Lab life news \n                   \n                     Policy news \n                   \n                     Leszek Borysiewicz \n                   \n                     Medical Research Council \n                   \n                     MRC stem-cell research \n                   \n                     John Beddington \n                   \n                     Imperial College London \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

A suite of seminal neuroscience papers by Henri Korn of the Pasteur Institute in Paris allegedly contains a string of anomalies in data interpretation, according to a reanalysis of the papers, published this week in the  Journal of Neurophysiology 1 . But Korn and his co-authors contest this and are critical of the reanalysis, which appears in the same journal as many of Korn's original papers. The papers, published over the past 25 years by Korn and his co-workers, including Donald Faber of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York, concern the dynamics of the release of neurotransmitter chemicals at the synapse \u2014 the junction between nerve cells (see  'Theory of neurotransmitter release moves on' ). They suggest that a single bouton (nerve terminus) releases only one quantum of transmitter per nerve impulse. This influential theory has major functional implications, but remains controversial. A key finding underpinning their theory was based on electrophysiological studies of giant nerve cells in goldfish, called Mauthner cells. Korn and Faber claimed that the number of synaptic boutons counted by light microscopy was highly correlated with the number worked out from an analysis of the amplitudes of the electrical spikes triggered by the neurotransmitter 2 . But their graph of the correlation, with data points lying on a nearly perfectly straight line, is \u201calmost miraculous\u201d given the noise and uncertainties in the underlying data, claims Jacques Ninio, a bioinformatician at the Ecole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure in Paris, who carried out the reanalysis. Ninio extracted the data from graphs in the papers and recomputed them. \u201cSeveral theoretical curves were simply not what Korn and co-workers claimed them to be,\u201d he says. Ninio's conclusions add to similar allegations by two researchers who worked in Korn's laboratory \u2014 Nicole Ropert, now at the University of Paris Descartes, and Luca Turin, a former researcher for the CNRS, France's basic-research agency, now at University College London. In 2004, Ropert submitted a 25-page report to the Pasteur Institute's research integrity committee detailing allegations of \u201cevents contrary to scientific ethics\u201d. But the committee last year opted to close the matter without an independent investigation. A similar request made by Turin to the CNRS in 1989 was also not taken forward. Ninio's challenge is dismissed in an accompanying response 3  by Korn, Faber and statistician Alain Mallet of the Pierre and Marie Curie University in Paris, who was a co-author on several of the papers. They criticize Ninio's approach, describing it as \u201cqualitative assessments of second-order representations of the data\u201d. \u201cAlthough we may have made some mistakes \u2014 inherent in any scientific inquiry \u2014 none of the putative errors invalidates the major findings in our papers,\u201d they write. The research, they write, \u201cchanged the nature of the scientific discussion about structure\u2013function correlations at synapses\u201d. They also add: \u201cSubsequent research carried out independently by a number of eminent scientists supported our proposal of the 'One-Vesicle Hypothesis'.\u201d Nature  has obtained the referees' reports on Ninio's paper. One referee comments that Ninio \u201cdemonstrates convincingly\u201d that claims in some of Korn and his colleagues' papers are unsuppported. They \u201care at best erroneous, and at worst deliberate falsifications of the results of the mathematical analysis\u201d, the referee alleges. The second referee's report argues that Ninio raises \u201ca disquieting number of discrepancies\u201d and that Ninio \u201cventures to say what many experienced observers have politely evaded: that at least one of the emperors of French neuroscience has no clothes\u201d. Nature  put these allegations and referees' comments to Korn, who says he answered the scientific queries raised by Ninio in his published response. But that rebuttal is \u201cunconvincing, though artful\u201d, claims Paul Adams, a neurobiologist at Stony Brook University in New York. \u201cNinio did the best he could in view of the fact that he did not have access to the original data.\u201d Adams describes the Ninio paper as \u201cvery useful\u201d, saying that published discussions of this issue have not been as sceptical as they should have been. \u201cThe 'sheep' mentality is alive and well even at the summits of neuroscience,\u201d he says. \n                     Modellers seek reason for low retraction rates \n                   \n                     The trouble with replication \n                   \n                     Let's replicate \n                   \n                     Misconduct?

The kouprey, an enigmatic Asian ox believed to be a hybrid \u2014 and so, unworthy of conservation efforts \u2014 is in fact a distinct species related to the banteng (a wild ox) 1 . The conclusion contradicts earlier findings 2  that the horned beast is a cross between the banteng and domesticated zebu cattle. First identified in 1937 and last spotted in the 1980s, the kouprey ( Bos sauveli ) has become a symbol for conservation in southeast Asia. Some experts think that it is already extinct. Gary Galbreath, a biologist at Chicago's Field Museum in Illinois who concluded that the kouprey was a hybrid, told  CBS News : \u201cIt is surely desirable not to waste time and money trying to locate or conserve a domestic breed gone wild.\u201d He based that conclusion on the observation that kouprey and banteng ( Bos javanicus ) shared several sequences of mitochondrial DNA. Now, Alexandre Hassanin and Anne Ropiquet of the National Natural History Museum in Paris have sequenced three regions of mitochondrial DNA and five of non-coding nuclear DNA from seven related species, including kouprey. The pair found that kouprey have unique sequences of both mitochondrial and nuclear DNA.

A colony of mice whose very existence defies logic could rewrite our understanding of human evolution, health and disease, researchers say. The laboratory mice lack stretches of DNA that scientists believed were essential for survival. And yet they eat, grow and reproduce normally. There seems to be nothing wrong with them despite their genetic deficiencies, says Nadav Ahituv, a human geneticist at the University of California, San Francisco, who created them through two painstaking years of breeding experiments. \u201cWe were expecting to see either fertility problems or a lethal phenotype\u201d \u2014 the mice being affected so severely that they die in the womb. But neither happened. \u201cI was very surprised,\u201d says Ahituv, who published his results this week 1 . Ahituv made four mouse 'knock-outs', each one lacking a stretch of DNA between 222 and 731 base pairs long. These same stretches of DNA exist in human genomes, base pair for base pair. This 'ultraconserved' DNA is exactly the same across the long evolutionary distance between humans and mice and rats. So why the mice lived could answer fundamental questions about evolution. Ultraconserved DNA was first described in May 2004, when a group led by David Haussler at the University of California, Santa Cruz, reported the existence of 481 stretches of DNA more than 200 base pairs long with completely identical sequences in mice, rats and humans 2 . Of these stretches, 256 were found in non-coding DNA, often far away from genes. Those found close to genes were often near developmental regulators, which hinted that the ultraconserved DNA might act as a switch in the cascade of events that shapes an embryo into a fully formed mouse or human. Beyond that, it wasn't clear what this class of DNA did, and so such regions have been called 'junk' DNA. But the fact that it was preserved through evolution led people to believe it was important. Haussler's group calculated that the probability of just one of these elements popping up at random in the human genome was less than 10 \u221222 . And on 17 August, Haussler's group reported in  Science  that natural selection processes are actively preventing ultraconserved DNA from changing. Haussler's group sequenced hundreds of pieces of ultraconserved DNA from 72 people and statistically analysed the pattern of variations in the ultraconserved regions. The pattern was consistent with that expected if natural selection was discriminating against mutations in ultraconserved regions 3 . \u201cThis means there is a force preventing mutations in the ultraconserved regions from spreading throughout the general population,\u201d Haussler says. \u201cWhat surprised me was the strength of the selection\u201d \u2014 about three times as strong as selection on protein-coding regions. However, although ultraconserved DNA seems crucial, scientists still aren't sure what it does or where it comes from. Ahituv was part of one group, headed up by Edward Rubin and based at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, California, that found that 45% of 167 ultraconserved elements tested in developing mice acted as enhancers \u2014 regulators that tune up gene activity 4 . Scientists led by Steven Brenner at the University of California, Berkeley, have found another regulatory role for ultraconserved elements in a family of human genes that regulate themselves by destroying their own messenger RNA templates 5 . Only a single ultraconserved element has so far revealed its origins. By scanning genome data, Haussler's group found that one human ultraconserved element is 80% similar to a piece of DNA found in a 400-million-year-old class of ancient fish that includes the coelacanth 6 . The element had been shuttled into the fish genome by a genetic invader called a retroposon, but mammals have now co-opted it to boost expression of a brain-development gene called  ISL1 . Although little is known about the history of ultraconserved DNA, it should still be possible to determine what makes it so important that it has been kept unchanged for millions of years. \u201cThe ultraconserved region could play a role in human diseases and we are now deciphering this unexpected involvement,\u201d says George Calin at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston. Ultraconserved DNA expression may be different in cancer cells and healthy cells, for example. Calin's findings are due to be published next week. Ahituv's new results seem to contradict the little that is known about ultraconserved DNA, says Haussler. He thinks that the knock-outs may have produced effects so small that they weren't obvious in controlled laboratory conditions. \u201cEvolution has performed vastly more trials than can ever be performed in a laboratory,\u201d Haussler says. \u201cIt's possible that there's a pretty small effect that is difficult to measure in the lab, but is significant in the long run.\u201d See Editorial,  \n                     page 1 \n                   . \n                     It's the junk that makes us human \n                   \n                     Mice do fine without 'junk DNA' \n                   \n                     'Junk' DNA reveals vital role \n                   \n                     NPG Omics Gateway \n                   \n                     Haussler Lab \n                   \n                     Bejerano Lab \n                   \n                     Brenner Lab \n                   \n                     Ahituv Lab \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Research on this striking natural phenomenon became something of a battleground after two groups, previously collaborators, put forward two opposing theories. Now, a team at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) in Pasadena, led by mechanical engineer Melany Hunt, says that they are both wrong 1 . \u201cThere are strong feelings in this field,\u201d says physicist Michael Bretz at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. \u201cIt'll take a while longer to get it sorted out. But the explanations keep getting better.\u201d The noise of the 'singing' dunes can be very loud, audible for up to ten kilometres. \u201cIt's really magnificent,\u201d says physicist St\u00e9phane Douady at the Ecole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure in Paris, who proposed one of the competing theories. Marco Polo described it on his journeys through the Gobi desert in the thirteenth century, attributing the sound to evil desert spirits. There is a sand-covered hill in northwestern China called Mingsha Shan, which means singing sand mountain. The effect is clearly related to avalanches of sand, and can be triggered by people sliding down the slopes. One of the first attempts at a scientific explanation came from Ralph Bagnold, an army engineer who fell in love with the North African deserts during the Second World War. He suggested that the noise was caused by sand grains colliding, and that the frequency of the sound was determined by the average time between collisions. This implies that the frequency depends on the size of the individual grains, increasing as the grains get smaller. Douady and his students Bruno Andreotti and Pascal Hersen focused on these collisions during a research trip in Morocco in 2001. Douady decided that for the moving grains to generate a single sound frequency, their motions must become synchronized. This synchronization, he argued, comes from standing waves set up in the sliding layer. The noise is loud because the surface of the dune acts like a giant loudspeaker membrane. But Andreotti came up with a slightly different explanation. The synchronization of grain motions, he said, comes from waves in the sand below the sliding layer, which then act back on the moving grains, 'locking' their movements together. It might seem like a small distinction, but Douady and Andreotti could not resolve their differences, and in the end they published separate papers offering their explanations 2 , 3 . Andreotti now works at a separate lab in Paris. But both explanations have serious problems, according to Hunt. For one thing, the measurements made by her team on booming dunes in Nevada and California seem to show that the booming frequency doesn't depend on the grain size at all. What's more, the previous theories imply that all dunes should be able to 'sing' when an avalanche takes place. But in fact not all dunes sing \u2014 that's why Mingsha Shan got its name, for example. Andreotti proposed that 'silent' dunes aren't dry enough, or have grains of the wrong shape. But Hunt and her colleagues think that the answer lies deeper than this. They say that dunes have to be covered in distinct layers of sand to create a boom. Their measurements of vibrations in the sand \u2014 made with an array of 'geophones' like those used to monitor seismic waves in earthquake studies \u2014 showed that the speed of these seismic waves increases in abrupt steps as the sand gets deeper. At 1.5 metres below the surface of one dune, for instance, the speed of the seismic waves increased from 180 metres per second to 310 metres per second. The Caltech researchers think that this layered structure enables the surface to act as a kind of waveguide for acoustic energy, rather like the way an optical fibre channels light. So although they agree that the boom is transmitted to the air by a loudspeaker effect of the dune surface, they think that the frequency is set by the width of the waveguide layer of sand. Dunes that do not have this layered structure, such as smaller dunes, do not sing at all. This is unlikely to be the last word on the matter, however. For one thing, the strange properties of the sand in 'booming dunes' are not just found in large structures. \u201cYou can take a cupful of this sand and excite it with your finger,\u201d says Peter Haff, a geologist at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina. \u201cYou can feel it vibrating, like running your finger over a washboard. But you can take sand from other parts of the dune, and there's nothing you can do to make it vibrate.\u201d Haff says that, although these theories may offer part of the answer, \u201cthere must be something else going on at a small scale\u201d. Douady agrees. \u201cThe problem for the Caltech theory is that we can recreate these sounds in the lab,\u201d he says. He thinks that the sand layering might play a role in modifying the sound, but that it is \u201cjust a decoration\u201d to the basic mechanism of booming. \n                     Desert dunes set to roam \n                   \n                     Quicksand can't suck you under \n                   \n                     Secret of world's biggest dunes revealed \n                   \n                     Snow knowing \n                   \n                     Vriend's page on booming dunes \n                   \n                     Douady's website on singing dunes, including videos and sound recordings \n                   \n                     Andreotti's website on singing dunes, also with sound \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Beijing In a bid to encourage scientific risk-taking and to curb rampant misconduct, China is planning to legislate for failure. A law proposed by the Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST) would allow Chinese scientists to report failures in their research without jeopardizing their chances of future funding. But critics say that policies with real impact, such as establishing systems for effective evaluation and oversight, are needed more urgently. \u201cChinese researchers are under tremendous pressure to produce results,\u201d says Cheng Guodong, a geoscientist at the Cold and Arid Regions Environmental and Engineering Research Institute in Lanzhou, Gansu province. \u201cTheir performance in the lab has a domino effect on other aspects of their life, such as promotion, salary and social benefits. So the stakes are high if they fail.\u201d Some believe that a consequent fear of failure is preventing Chinese scientists from taking risks, and results in research misconduct across the country. According to the draft law, failure of research projects would not have any professional bearing on researchers as long as they could demonstrate that the experiments were well thought out and properly conducted, says Xue Lan, executive vice-president of the Development Research Academy for the 21st Century at Tsinghua University, Beijing, who heads the team that has drafted the proposal. It was announced on 26 August, the day before the international Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development released a report calling for improved innovation capacity in China. In 2005, China became the world's sixth biggest spender on research and development, and it currently has more researchers than any country apart from the United States. But the report, commissioned by MOST, concludes that China has a long way to go in building the mature, national innovation system it wants. Some commentators say that China needs to introduce radical reforms to improve its innovation capacity. But is the proposed legislation for failure the right way of going about it? Li Gong, chief executive of Mozilla Online, the Beijing subsidiary of the global software company, is not convinced. \u201cThe starting point of the proposal is fundamentally flawed. The definition of failure in research is problematic because negative results also yield knowledge,\u201d he points out. \u201cThis is a useful but small step,\u201d says Mu-ming Poo, a neuroscientist at the University of California, Berkeley, and director of the Institute of Neuroscience in Shanghai. But the proposed amendment is built on the premise that there is critical appraisal of a project's success or failure in China, which is not the case, he says. Many researchers believe that the lack of a transparent evaluation system is the real reason for the poor performance of China's scientists and that this needs to be tackled urgently. \u201cWithout that, everything will fall apart,\u201d says Cheng. \u201cFear of failure is only partly responsible for rampant research misconduct in China,\u201d says Bai Lu, a neuroscientist at the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development in Bethesda, Maryland. \u201cAt the heart of the matter is that there is no effective oversight mechanism to ensure that fraudsters do not go unpunished. The lack of a culture of accountability is a much broader and deeper issue.\u201d According to the newspaper  China Daily , the draft law says that principal investigators should establish credibility records for their staff in order to curb fraud, and asks researchers to be 'self-disciplined'. \u201cBut self-discipline is not enough,\u201d says Lu. \u201cThat's the point.\u201d Despite the criticisms, the proposed law has its supporters. Duan Yibing, a science-policy researcher at the Institute of Policy and Management in Beijing, explains that basic laws carry supreme authority in China, so legislation that recognizes the intrinsic risks associated with research and is tolerant of failure would send a powerful signal. \u201cRisk-taking is the most important aspect in science, so China is doing the right thing,\u201d says Raghunath Mashelkar, president of the Indian National Science Academy in New Delhi. \u201cThe law would influence the way researchers and funding agencies behave and generate an environment conducive to innovation.\u201d In India, Mashelkar has successfully carved out a niche for innovation by setting up special funds, such as the Kite-Flying Fund and the New Millennium Indian Technology Leadership Initiative, for high-risk projects, a strategy he thinks may offer China some useful lessons. Legislation alone would not be enough to cause fundamental change in the culture of scientific research in China, acknowledges an employee at MOST, who wishes to remain anonymous. He says that a series of supporting regulations and policies, including those for improving appraisal and oversight systems, are already under discussion. \u201cThe law would not only provide a guiding principle for formulating those rules but a significant impetus for their implementation,\u201d he says. The proposed law is being deliberated by the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, China's top legislature. A decision is expected to be made next March. \n                     Innovation versus science? \n                   \n                     China tightens up \n                   \n                     China's green accounting system on shaky ground \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Although both had an extensive list of publications in gravitational physics, they struggled to answer even basic, high-school-level questions, according to \u00d6zg\u00fcr Sario\u011flu, an associate professor at METU. \u201cThey didn't know fundamental stuff like newtonian mechanics,\u201d he says. Suspicious, one of Sario\u011flu's colleagues, Ay\u015fe Karasu, began to look through the duo's publication record. Using Google, she quickly turned up a paper from which it seemed the students had lifted several lengthy sections. By mid-February, faculty members had identified dozens of articles on arXiv that they say seemed to be partly or completely plagiarized. They notified Ginsparg, who began his own investigation. So far, the search has turned up 67 papers, about half of which have appeared in low-profile peer-review journals. In addition to the two students at METU, the papers were authored by professors and students at three other universities: Dicle University in Diyarbakir, the University of Mersin in I\u00e7el, and Onsekiz Mart University in \u00c7anakkale. Sario\u011flu says that most of the plagiarism seems to have come from two rival groups, one at Onsekiz Mart and the other at Mersin and Dicle. Many of the papers concern an obscure theory of gravity known as the M\u00f8ller version of general relativity. Few people would be likely to check such work, allowing the students and professors to build their publication record without fear of being caught, says Ginsparg. \u201cThey were following the optimal strategy.\u201d \u201cThey're isolated, their English is bad, and they need to publish,\u201d says Sario\u011flu. \u201cSo they plagiarize, I guess,\u201d he says of the alleged plagiarizers. A recent analysis turned up numerous examples of plagiarism on the arXiv server (see  Nature   444 , 524\u2013525; doi:10.1038/444524b 2006 ). Ginsparg says that it's not uncommon for scientists with a poor command of English to plagiarize introductions or background paragraphs from earlier work, often adding an appropriate citation. He thinks that although such practices are ethically questionable, it is inappropriate to be overly draconian. Katepalli Sreenivasan, director of the International Centre for Theoretical Physics in Trieste, Italy, which has a programme of collaboration with physicists from the developing world, agrees. \u201cThere are some cultures in which plagiarism is not even regarded as deplorable,\u201d he says. Problems of academic integrity come up frequently at the centre, and are dealt with on a case-by-case basis, he adds. But both think that the Turkish case clearly crosses the line. \u201cIt's dishonest and sloppy,\u201d Ginsparg says. He adds that, although arXiv normally declines to publicize such incidents, the size and scope of this case made it an exception. Salti and Aydogdu have been suspended for two terms, according to Sario\u011flu. They cannot be expelled because METU's ethics policies for students do not include rules on plagiarism. But, he says, it is unlikely they will be able to continue at the university. Meanwhile, Salti says that he and several authors plan to bring a lawsuit against arXiv. It remains unclear whether the other three universities involved have taken any action. \n                     Preprint analysis quantifies scientific plagiarism \n                   \n                     Clamp down on copycats \n                   \n                     Special Report: Taking on the cheats \n                   \n                     Plagiarism in Cambridge physics lab prompts calls for guidelines \n                   \n                     A list of the plagiarized articles \n                   \n                     Middle East Technical University \n                   \n                     More on plagiarism detection in arXiv \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Controversial genomics pioneer Craig Venter has sequenced his own genome. In a preliminary analysis published this week (S. Levy  et al .  PLoS Biol .  5,  e254; 2007), Venter's team has picked apart the sequences belonging to both chromosomes in each of the 23 chromosome pairs found in his cells, providing the first glimpse of the variation found within a single genome. The paper also highlights some features of Venter's genome. The sequence of his  ABCC11  gene, for example, indicates that Venter is likely to have wet earwax, as opposed to dry. In a finding likely to disappoint some critics of the maverick scientist, Venter has four repeat sequences located just before his  MAOA  gene. Having only three of the repeats is associated with an increased risk of antisocial behaviour. On a more sobering note, Venter's  APOE  sequence is associated with a higher risk of Alzheimer's and cardiovascular diseases, and his  SORL1  gene also contains several variants that are associated with Alzheimer's disease. For more about his personal genomic and family history, Venter aficionados can refer to his upcoming book,  A Life Decoded . Venter has placed references to how his genome sequence may have affected his life throughout the book, says Jan Witkowski, executive director of the Banbury Center at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in New York, who is reviewing the book for the 4 October issue of  Nature . Venter's sequence also provides important new information about the human genome. Previous sequencing efforts have not distinguished between the two copies of each chromosome, or even between DNA from different donors. \u201cWhat we were doing was mixing up alleles,\u201d says Samuel Levy \u2014 who led the study at the J. Craig Venter Institute in Rockville, Maryland \u2014 referring to DNA sequences from specific spots on the chromosome. \u201cWe were creating Frankenstein versions of chromosomes.\u201d This time, armed with an additional 13 million sequences \u2014 added to the 19 million generated from Venter's own DNA during the first genome project \u2014 and fresh algorithms designed to pick apart sequences from different versions of the same chromosomes, Levy and his team could look at the variation within the genome. They found more than 4 million variations between the two sequences, including single nucleotide differences, sequence insertions and deletions, and differences in the number of copies of a given gene. Some 44% of Venter's genes contained a genetic difference between copies found on each chromosome. Venter's two sets of chromosomes differed by 0.5%, suggesting that there may be seven times more DNA variation than previously expected, says Levy. This approach provides a clearer picture of the human genome, says Edward Rubin, director of the Joint Genome Institute in Walnut Creek, California. Before, the sequence gave a \u201cstatistical view\u201d of the genome, Rubin says. \u201cAnd in fact the genome is not statistical, it's really a linear array of bases.\u201d Venter notes that single genetic changes are unlikely to seal his fate. \u201cI take it very seriously,\u201d he says. \u201cBut most diseases are going to be some huge compilation of human factors and environmental factors.\u201d Witkowski agrees, but says that reading about someone's genome can strike an emotional chord. \u201cSomehow there's a sense that when you tell people that sequence, you're telling them in a very deep way about yourself,\u201d he says. \u201cIt's like looking at their medical records.\u201d See Editorial,  \n                     page 1 \n                   . \n                     James Watson's genome sequenced \n                   \n                     Celebrity genomes alarm researchers \n                   \n                     Genome sequencing X Prize announced \n                   \n                     Sequencers step up to the speed challenge \n                   \n                     Nature Omics Gateway \n                   \n                     Dissect Medicine \n                   \n                     Heredity blog \n                   \n                     DNA's 50th Anniversary Special \n                   \n                     J.

Another team of genome researchers at the J. Craig Venter Institute in Rockville, Maryland, which has been investigating the DNA of a rather less salubrious organism, this week reports a surprise discovery: the DNA of fruitfly  Drosophila ananassae  contains the entire genome of a parasitic bacterium of the  Wolbachia  genus. Smaller parts of the parasite's genetic material also turned up in worms and wasps. Bacteria commonly swap DNA with each other. But transfer of bacterial genes into animals was thought to be rare. The new work, published in  Science  (J. C. Dunning Hotopp  et al .  Science  doi:10.1126/science.1142490; 2007), suggests that gene flow from bacteria to animal hosts happens on a larger scale and more commonly than suspected. And it hints that the bacterial genome may have provided some sort of evolutionary advantage to its host. \u201cYou're talking about a significant portion of [the fruitfly] DNA that is now from  Wolbachia ,\u201d says Julie Dunning Hotopp, who led the study. \u201cThere has to be some sort of selection to carry around that much extra DNA.\u201d But Dunning Hotopp's former colleague Jonathan Eisen of the University of California, Davis, contests this. \u201cOne cannot conclude that some DNA is advantageous simply because it is there,\u201d he says. Up to 75% of insect species are plagued by  Wolbachia , which lives inside testes and ovaries and passes from one female generation to another through infected ova. To ensure its spread,  Wolbachia  can skew insect birth ratios towards females and even prevent infected males from successfully mating with disease-free females. The bacterium's close association with egg cells means there's ample opportunity for bacterial DNA to get permanently sewn into a host's nuclear genome, says Dunning Hotopp. When Dunning Hotopp and her colleagues analysed the DNA of  D. ananassae  uninfected by  Wolbachia , they found 44 of the 45  Wolbachia  genes they searched for. Because these selected genes are so widely spread throughout  Wolbachia  DNA, this suggests that the rest of its more than 1-million-base-pair genome is also likely to be found in fruitflies. Many of the  Wolbachia  genes were infiltrated by strands of insect DNA that jump around the genome, and so are unlikely to be functional. But the researchers showed that at least 28 of the bacteria's 1,206 genes are active in the flies. More genes that have seeped from bacteria into animals are certain to be found, the researchers say, particularly in reptiles and amphibians. But finding bacterial genes in mammals is unlikely because no bacteria are known to infect their sperm and egg cells. \n                     Anti-malaria mosquitoes prove extra fit \n                   \n                     Parasite infiltrates fruitfly research \n                   \n                     Genes caught skipping from bacteria to beetle \n                   \n                     Wolbachia, widowmaker \n                   \n                     Werren Lab \n                   \n                     Wolbachia  Consortium \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

A process aimed at revising the regulation of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) has been launched by the US Department of Agriculture (USDA). But critics fear the changes will not go far enough to protect the environment and public health.

A draft environmental-impact statement released in July gives the first glimpses of how the USDA rules might change. It proposes to expand its authority from plants that might endanger other plants to \u201cthe full range of potential agricultural and environmental risks posed by these organisms, including risks to public health\u201d. The agency is also suggesting a tiered programme, with different regulations for different levels of risk, and special rules for organisms that produce compounds used in industry or pharmaceutical products. Other proposals include allowing regulation of a crop that has previously been officially \u201cderegulated\u201d and creating a new category for permitted \u201clow level presence\u201d of GMOs in food and seed crops.

A groundbreaking analysis of Neanderthal DNA that suggested they interbred with humans was based on samples contaminated with human DNA, a new study suggests. The study 1 , published on 28 August in  PLoS Genetics , reanalysed about one million base pairs of fossilized Neanderthal DNA that had been analysed in a paper published last November in  Nature 2 . The  Nature  paper and a paper in  Science 3  published the same week on 65,000 base pairs were the first reports on Neanderthal nuclear DNA. But around 80% of the sequences in the  Nature  paper are modern human DNA, not Neanderthal, claims Jeffrey Wall, an evolutionary geneticist at the University of California, San Francisco, who led the  PLoS Genetics  study. This indicates that human genetic material was somehow introduced into the samples. This known risk is increased by the closeness of the two species \u2014 the 3-billion-base-pair genomes of a human and a Neanderthal differ by less than 0.5%. The results in the  Nature  paper suggested that there was interbreeding among Neanderthals and humans in their common European home ground before Neanderthals became extinct 30,000 years ago. The  Science  article found no genetic evidence of interbreeding. Svante P\u00e4\u00e4bo, senior author of the  Nature  paper, concedes that his group at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany, had problems with contamination. These prompted him to change laboratory procedures and to add controls late in 2006, after the paper was published. \u201cI agree with [Wall's] analysis,\u201d P\u00e4\u00e4bo says. \u201cTheir observations are formally correct.\u201d P\u00e4\u00e4bo's co-author Michael Egholm, who is research vice-president at 454 Life Sciences in Branford, Connecticut, adds: \u201cThere is no denying contamination. It was one of the dangers of doing this.\u201d But ongoing analysis indicates that human contamination in their study was just 30%, Egholm adds. There had been intense debate over the contrasting results in the  Nature  and  Science  papers, which analysed the same 38,000-year-old Neanderthal bones from Croatia using different sequencing methods. P\u00e4\u00e4bo's group used 454's rapid 'direct sequencing' approach, whereas the  Science  team, led by Edward Rubin of the Joint Genome Institute in Walnut Creek, California, used a traditional method using cloned DNA and bacteria to generate the base pairs. The studies gave different estimates for the time Neanderthals diverged from humans \u2014 the  Science  article pegged it at 706,000 years ago, whereas the  Nature  paper set it at 516,000 years ago. Wall's study confirms the 706,000-year divergence date. The probable human DNA contamination led to the more recent date and may have led to the suggestion of later interbreeding, Wall says. The  Nature  paper also found more similarities between genetic variations called SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms) in Neanderthal and human DNA than the  Science  paper, even after allowing for the  Nature  group's larger number of base pairs. P\u00e4\u00e4bo's team reported that about 30% of the SNPs in the Neanderthal DNA are derived \u2014 that is, the mutations occurred \u2014 in today's humans. P\u00e4\u00e4bo acknowledges there is \u201ca potential problem\u201d with the presence of these human SNPs in the Neanderthal sequence. These same discrepancies were noted by Rubin's group. \u201cWe had concerns,\u201d says Rubin. \u201cWe suspected some of the issues raised by Wall.\u201d Both P\u00e4\u00e4bo's and Rubin's groups expect to publish further Neanderthal sequences from other specimens that each group is studying.

The plight of wild gorillas has taken a turn for the worse, according to the latest edition of the World Conservation Union (IUCN) Red List of Threatened Species. Western gorillas ( Gorilla gorilla ), which live in the western Congo basin, have moved from 'endangered' to 'critically endangered' in the 2007 list. And conservationists anticipate that the mountain gorilla ( G. beringei ), which is now found only in Rwanda, Uganda and the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo, will follow suit once its population survey is completed. The number of western gorillas has declined by more than 60% in the past 25 years, according to the new assessment, published on 12 September. The Ebola outbreak that has hit the main subspecies, the western lowland gorilla ( G. gorilla gorilla , pictured) is largely responsible \u2014 wiping out roughly one-third of individuals in protected areas. The upgraded conservation status is mainly the result of the Ebola outbreak and a resurgent trade in bushmeat, says Russ Mittermeier, chair of the IUCN Primate Specialist Group in Arlington, Virginia. \u201cThe decline has been really precipitous,\u201d he says. \u201cGorillas are still being sold as a luxury food item.\u201d Mountain gorillas are less numerous than western gorillas, but have not yet been upgraded to critically endangered. This is mainly because the most vulnerable subspecies ( G. beringei beringei ) \u2014 numbering barely 700 gorillas in the Virunga mountain range on the border of Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo \u2014 has been kept stable by a popular and well-managed tourism programme. But civil strife in the Congo means that this security is under threat. Last week, the conservation group WWF reported that park rangers had been leaving their posts in fear of armed rebels, who have already killed several gorillas within the Congo's parks this year. The Red List contains details of some 41,000 species, of which more than 16,000 are officially threatened with extinction. Additions to the 2007 list include three species of coral, the first corals ever to be included.

As governments race to stockpile Tamiflu and other antivirals in preparation for the next influenza pandemic, scientists are starting to look at a different approach \u2014 drugs that modulate the immune system. Proponents argue that these abundant and cheaper drugs, such as statins, might be a useful option where antivirals are unavailable or have been given too late. But sceptics fear that they might do more harm than good because they suppress the body's immune response to the virus. With the latest studies seeming to contradict each other, the flu community is divided about the best way to proceed. The high mortality associated with viruses such as avian flu is thought to be because the immune system has a massive over-reaction to the infection. The body hikes its production of immune molecules called cytokines, which flood into the bloodstream, causing what's known as a cytokine storm.This triggers inflammation and lung damage, and can lead to multiple organ failure and death. So rather than the usual approach of targeting the virus, researchers hope that mortality could be reduced by using drugs that regulate this immune response. At present, planning for pandemics is focused on stockpiling antivirals. But becasue these drugs, such as Tamiflu, are expensive and difficult to manufacture, there may not be enough to go round by the time another pandemic strikes, and poorer countries may not have access to them at all. \u201cIf we are to be serious about confronting a pandemic, we must urgently evaluate agents that are already available and affordable to people in all countries,\u201d says David Fedson, former director of medical affairs at Paris-based Aventis Pasteur, now Sanofi-Aventis. This month, Ian Clark's group at the Australian National University in Canberra published a study 1  investigating the effectiveness of another immune-modulating drug, called gemfibrozil, in mice infected with the influenza virus. Gemfibrozil is a fibrate, a class of drug widely prescribed to lower lipid concentrations in the blood. But it also inhibits the release of inflammatory cytokines such as tumour-necrosis factor, interferon-\u03b3 and interleukin-6, and stimulates production of the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-4. Clark's team infected mice with H2N2 \u2014 the flu strain that caused the 1957 pandemic. Four days later, once the rodents had become sick, they injected 46 mice with 60 milligrams per kilogram of body weight of gemfibrozil once a day for six days. Twice as many of the treated mice (52%) survived compared with controls (26%). \n               Tread with caution \n             \u201cThe paper should spark some interest, but even more caution,\u201d says Erik De Clercq, a virologist at the Catholic University of Leuven in Belgium. He points out that it is difficult to extrapolate from Clark's H2N2 mouse model to the H5N1 strain in humans. For example, he says, it did not show that increased survival was directly due to inhibition of the cytokine storm. Clark agrees and is planning further studies to rule out the possibility of confounding effects, such as the drug having a direct antiviral effect. However, two other studies suggest that the cytokine storm might not be as fatal as thought. In one study 2 , mice that had one cytokine pathway knocked out showed no reduction in mortality compared with normal mice after they were infected with H5N1. \u201cThese results refute the popular paradigm that the cytokine storm is the cause of death during H5N1 infection,\u201d says Robert Webster, who carried out the study with his colleagues at St Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee. In the second study 3 , by Jacqueline Katz's group at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, Georgia, mice deficient in the inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1 receptor had worse mortality, higher viral loads and more inflammation than did controls when infected with the HK/486 virus. But both studies tested only three to five mice in each experiment, and looked at only a few of the many overlapping cytokine pathways, points out Eric Mortensen of the Audie L. Murphy Veterans hospital in San Antonio, Texas. They need to be replicated with a much larger number of mice, and examining other potential pathways, says Mortensen. Clark even asserts that \u201cif the same outcomes had been repeated at  n  = 15, the statistics would show the opposite of what Webster's group claimed,\u201d he says. However, Rachelle Salomon, the lead author of the study, says \u201clarge numbers of mice would be ideal, but due to our experience with these viruses, I am confident with the result and conclusions\u201d. The groups were small because the experiments needed to be done in laboratories with an approved biosafety level of at least 3 (the maximum is 4), she explains. Because Australia has different standards, Clark was able to use level 2 facilities. Statins \u2014 another lipid-lowering class of drug with anti-inflammatory effects \u2014 might be a better bet than gemfibrozil, says Mortensen, who has papers in the press showing that these drugs lower the number of deaths from pneumonia. And then there is a preliminary analysis 4  of 20,000 patients older than 50 years enrolled in the University Medical Center Utrecht primary-care network in the Netherlands by Eelko Hak and his colleagues at the university. They found that during flu epidemics, people who took statins were 28% less likely to develop respiratory disease and 51% less likely to die from any cause than were those who did not take the drugs. Another, case-control study 5  of 130,000 patients also found that current use of statins lowered mortality from pneumonia. But Frederick Hayden of the World Health Organization's global influenza programme says that pandemic flu involves protracted viral replication, often over weeks, so using immune drugs when viral replication is high could do more damage than good. A more sensible idea might be to study joint treatments with immune modulators and antivirals, he says. But definitive answers can only come from clinical trials done immediately after the onset of a pandemic, says Peter Openshaw of Imperial College London. \u201cWe need to be able to plan ahead and set up trial protocols, but that's not easy to do when we don't know when an epidemic may strike.\u201d \n                     Australia tackles bird flu using RNAi \n                   \n                     Controlling immune response may cut bird flu death rate \n                   \n                     Researchers call for more bird flu drugs \n                   \n                     New flu treatment calms immune response \n                   \n                     Nature Reports Avian Flu \n                   \n                     WHO Avian Flu \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

In April, planetary scientist Alan Stern joined NASA as associate administrator for science, putting him in charge of the agency's $5.5-billion science budget. Now he must juggle more than 90 space missions and 3,000 grants with focuses ranging from Earth to the distant Universe. \n               You've announced extensions to a number of missions lately. Does this mean you're cutting future missions? \n             Not at all \u2014 it's an effective way to get more science done with our budget. Often this gives you more bang for the buck by providing important new science for very little additional cost. With these extensions, we're going to get two new comet visits and a search for extrasolar planets for about 15% of the cost that either of the Stardust and Deep Impact missions took to build. And there will be more future missions. \n               What about costs? \n             Cost can be held down by properly scoping missions to begin with and then closely managing to that budget. There's been too much management by open chequebook, and that will not be continued. We are changing the culture about overruns and we are not going to tolerate them as was done in the past. The Kepler mission [to find Earth-like planets] is one example. When they came saying they needed more money I said 'no' repeatedly. And they found a way to stay within budget. \n               The Mars programme is the biggest planetary programme at NASA, but what's the status of a mission to bring back rocks? \n             Mars sample return has been on the to-do list for 35 years, but it's had a very frustrating life cycle. It has repeatedly become very popular and then grown to be so large as to be unaffordable. But because it's been so highly ranked by the scientific community, I want to see us finally do it. So I've asked Doug McCuistion, our Mars programme director, to draw up architectures for an affordable Mars sample-return mission, and to design it to cost. To remain affordable it will have to be a Chevy sample-return instead of a Cadillac version, but I know what we've got from overly ambitious, Cadillac-like Mars sample-return mission plans: zero grams of martian rock. \n               Will it really happen this time? \n             To show people I'm serious about getting started, I've asked the spacecraft builders at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory to add a sample-caching ability to the our next rover, the Mars Science Laboratory [planned to launch in 2009]. As that drives around it will pick up samples and store them for possible pick-up by the sample-return mission a decade hence. This will give us critical practice at sampling on Mars, and it will also give us the option of skipping a future rover to cache samples \u2014 meaning we can reduce the cost and shorten the time until a documented sample is back on Earth. \n               Some scientists question the Vision for Space Exploration, NASA's push to return astronauts to the Moon. What real science is there to be learned from such a programme? \n             Let's remember that Apollo was very important scientifically. It taught us that the Earth\u2013Moon system was born in a giant impact, it taught us about the importance of magma oceans, and its samples may even have recorded the signature of the clearing of the Kuiper belt [a phase in the early Solar System when mass was lost from the asteroid belt]. With twenty-first-century technology we will be able to accomplish a lot more science when we return to the Moon than Apollo ever could with 1960s technology. The vision for space exploration is critically important for the country, and it's also extremely exciting for science. Imagine: we'll be sending sophisticated field laboratories and, later, geologists, geophysicists and geochemists to the Moon. Perhaps the Vision will allow these same capabilities to be extended to near-Earth asteroids and to Mars. Think about Mars sample return with human crews \u2014 it will be tremendous. Instead of just hundreds of grams, humans can bring back hundreds of kilograms of samples. The science is just mouthwatering. \n               What about Earth? Will you restore some of the remote-sensing missions that have been cut in recent years? \n             We at NASA are currently operating a fleet of Earth-monitoring satellites that are the envy of other nations. We are simultaneously building the next Landsat mission, and we have seven other Earth-studies missions, representing billions of dollars in investment, under construction. No other nation can match this. We are now planning the next wave of Earth research missions recommended by the Earth-studies decadal survey released this year. \n                 Interview by Alexandra Witze \n               Reprints and Permissions"},

It was one of the most important astronomical discoveries of the twentieth century, and it became one of the more controversial when only one of the discoverers received a Nobel prize. Now a fascinating new footnote has been added to the story of how pulsars were discovered with the revelation that some had previously been observed by a US Air Force staff sergeant at a remote Alaskan outpost. Earlier this month, 81-year-old Charles Schisler came forward to tell the story of how he used a military radar to identify around a dozen radio sources, some of which were pulsars. Astronomers who have seen Schisler's meticulous logs believe that he spotted a bright pulsar in the nearby Crab Nebula months before the first scientific observation of a pulsar was published in  Nature  (A. Hewish  et al .  Nature   217 , 709\u2013713; 1968). Although Schisler never knew exactly what he was seeing, the story should be counted as an early pulsar spotting, says Jocelyn Bell Burnell, an astronomer at the University of Oxford, UK, and one of the authors on the original paper. \u201cHe happened to be a very observant person,\u201d Bell Burnell says. Schisler's story began in the summer of 1967 during a mind-numbing four-hour shift on an early-warning radar at Clear Air Force Station in Alaska. He was using the Ballistic Missile Early Warning System, a massive set of radars that looked some 4,800 km across Siberia for incoming warheads. As he sat at his station, the bored, 41-year-old staff sergeant noticed a faint signal on his scope. During the course of the summer, the source continued to show up. \u201cI kept seeing it week after week,\u201d he says. Then one day Schisler noticed something \u2014 the mysterious blip appeared 4 minutes earlier than the day before. Four minutes meant a lot to the airman: before being stationed at Clear, he had been a navigator on a B-47 bomber, and he knew that stars rise 4 minutes earlier each night as a result of Earth's motion around the Sun. Schisler calculated the source's approximate position in the sky and wrote it down on a scrap of paper. Over the weekend, he drove 125 km to the University of Alaska at Fairbanks, where he met an astronomy professor who showed him the location of his source \u2014 the Crab Nebula, some 6,300 light years from Earth. At the centre of the Crab, a supernova remnant, there sits a bright pulsar. Schisler returned to Clear with the coordinates of other radio sources that he thought he might be able to detect with the radar. Throughout the late summer and early autumn, he began a meticulous log of anything he could spot on the scope. Because the radar was designed to pick up man-made pulses bouncing off incoming missiles rather than steady signals, Schisler believes most of the things he saw were pulsars. By his own count, he spotted about a dozen sources. \u201cMy commanders didn't know what the hell I was doing,\u201d he recalls. The work preceded by several months the observations made by Bell Burnell, then at the University of Cambridge, UK, which led to the first paper on the subject. A Nobel prize for the discovery was subsequently awarded to her supervisor Antony Hewish, but, controversially, not to her. Schisler was not the only one to \u201cpre-discover\u201d a pulsar, though, according to Bell Burnell. \u201cThere are actually a lot of stories,\u201d she says. In the 1950s, a woman visiting the observatory at the University of Chicago, Illinois, pointed out that there was a regularly pulsating source of visible light in the Crab Nebula. Elliot Moore, an astronomer at the university, dismissed the woman's claim, telling her that all stars seem to flicker. Another radio astronomer she knows of will, after a drink or two, confess to having dismissed observations of a pulsating source as the result of faulty equipment. \u201cHe's a bit embarrassed now,\u201d says Bell Burnell. For his part, Schisler says he never quite understood what he was looking at until he heard of Hewish and Bell Burnell's discovery on a short-wave radio. When he learned that they had discovered a pulsating radio star, Schisler says, the significance of his own work became clear. But he says he didn't dare speak about the log until nearly half a century later, when the old early-warning system at Clear was finally decommissioned. He says that he feels he deserves no credit for his work, but he still regrets that he was unable to share what he had seen. \u201cI wish we had had a way to communicate with the scientific community,\u201d he says. \n                     Observation of a Rapidly Pulsating Radio Source \n                   \n                     Star twins \n                   \n                     Some stars may be older than they look \n                   \n                     More About Pulsars \n                   \n                     The Crab Nebula \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

A cicada known as the kumazemi is descending on Japan en masse, deafening the citizens and wreaking havoc on the country's fibre-optic system. The 6- to 7-centimetre-long black cicada ( Cryptotympana facialis ) inhabits western Japan and subtropical regions of eastern Asia. This August is expected to be the largest and noisiest cicada summer in the insect's four-year cycle. Surveys of the shells shed by maturing cicadas at a park in Osaka, carried out by Shigehiko Shiyake, curator of the Osaka Museum of Natural History, and Eiji Numata, a biologist at Osaka University, show that the cicada population increases every year for four years, after which it returns to base level and the cycle restarts. From the past three years' data, the scientists calculate that this year will be the four-year peak, with nearly 2.5 times as many cicadas as in 2006. The noise level is also set to climb. Measured at 90.4 decibels at another Osaka park last year, this year the same spot is expected to hit 94 decibels \u2014 decibels follow a logarithmic scale, so that's more than double the volume. Prolonged exposure to this level of noise can cause deafness. The kumazemi are also cutting households off from their Internet. Apparently mistaking fibre-optic cables for withered branches, they have been punching their one-millimetre-diameter ovipositors into the cables and laying eggs. In at least 1,000 cases over the past two years, the cicadas have either severed the cable or opened up a hole, allowing water to seep in. The Osaka-based Nippon Telephone and Telegraph West Corporation has responded by creating new cables that lack the grooves that the cicadas target with their ovipositors and by adding another protective plastic layer to the cable.

David Schwartz and the agency he heads are not having much of a summer. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) has announced that it will investigate \u201cthe management and leadership\u201d of its environmental agency, the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina. NIEHS director Schwartz is temporarily stepping aside \u201cto eliminate even the perception that the review is anything other than independent and unbiased\u201d. The investigation is expected to take several months. Schwartz was a controversial figure even before he took the job. In April 2005, after the NIH announced new rules on the kinds and amounts of stock its employees could hold, Schwartz said he would not take the post of director. After confidential chats with NIH head Elias Zerhouni, he felt reassured enough to take the job. Since then, a cavalcade of charges has been made against Schwartz, many of which came from the office of Senator Charles Grassley (Republican, Iowa). Grassley accused Schwartz of overspending by $4 million on his own lab at the expense of other intramural researchers and took exception to the expert-witness role Grassley took in some asbestos-related lawsuits, allowing attorneys to dwell on his credentials. Schwartz has since stopped giving expert testimony. Scientists at the institute also complain that he has disregarded the results of peer review when allocating funds and provoked conflict by attempting to privatize one of the institute's journals,  Environmental Health Perspectives . And this month, officials at NIEHS handed out a form requesting that staff report any phone calls they receive from Congress \u2014 the type of form usually used by staff who deal with legislative affairs. On 20 August, Grassley wrote a letter to Zerhouni that said: \u201cHanding this form out to rank and file NIEHS employees during the course of a congressional investigation could cause these employees to feel that management is attempting to flush out whistleblowers or any other individual assisting me with my inquiry.\u201d However, it is not clear whether the forms went to more than a handful of people. Scientists in the institute's intramural research programme have also voted on their feelings about the tumult. Of 206 tenured and tenure-track scientists, 146 participated.

The global carbon market is far busier this year than last, according to figures released this month. Around 1.2 gigatonnes of carbon \u2014 worth \u20ac15.8 billion (US$21.4 billion) \u2014 were traded worldwide in the first half of 2007, primarily on the European Union (EU) Emissions Trading Scheme, according to analysts at carbon-market consultants Point Carbon in Oslo, Norway. Last year saw a mere \u20ac22.5 billion change hands all year. But another Point Carbon analysis points out that the infant US market of ten northeastern states looks to be planning too many initial allowances. Volume is up in the EU market, experts say, because traders are looking to the future. Trading on emissions allowances from the first, experimental, phase of the exchange collapsed in April 2006 and has never recovered. Most trading now is on allowances for the second phase, which begins on 1 January 2008 and runs to 2012. Currently, a credit bought on the open market for a tonne of emissions from the developing world through the Kyoto Protocol's Clean Development Mechanism costs less than buying the straightforward allowance to emit a tonne. As a result, many companies in the industrial world are selling off the maximum permissible percentage of their allowances and making up the difference with these 'certified emission reductions' (CERs). This lowers prices (see  Nature   448 , 401; doi:10.1038/448401b 2007 ) but increases volume. It has also led to a secondary market in buying and selling CERs. Another inducement to trade now is that companies can save allowances from the second phase for use in any year in the future, a feature called 'infinite banking'. The increased activity is good for the health of the market, according to Guy Turner, director of New Carbon Finance in London. For one, it smooths out ups and downs in price, calming skittish investors. \u201cIt's the weight of numbers,\u201d says Turner. \u201cThings move much more sluggishly.\u201d And, according to Endre Tvinnereim, senior analyst at Point Carbon, increased volume is good for the planet as well. \u201cIncreased activity increases the number of actors with a financial stake in a better environment,\u201d he says. Across the Atlantic, as the US Congress lurches towards passing a bill that would establish a carbon market in America, a few vanguard states have started their own. But analysts say that this scheme may face the same problem that crashed the European market. The value of phase I credits in the EU scheme fell to nearly nothing because there were far more credits floating around than companies needed.Point Carbon's analysis indicates that the US Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI), comprising ten states on the northeast coast, from Maine to Delaware, may be planning allowances for 13% more carbon than they need. Meanwhile, Arizona, California, New Mexico, Oregon, Washington, Utah and two Canadian provinces have agreed to develop a cap-and-trade scheme within the next 12 months. Janet Peace, an economist at the Pew Center on Global Climate Change in Washington DC, points out that the number of credits in the RGGI had been set before the EU phase I crash. \u201cRGGI had already put their model rule out there. I don't think you can blame them for the lesson that came later.\u201d She also says that over-allocation will not necessarily spell doom for the nascent US market, which is to start trading in 2009. Many states will auction off their credits, some with a minimum bid, thus giving them some value from the off. But there is a lesson for future schemes in the over-allocation crash and subsequent rebound in the EU, Peace says: \u201cYou need good data on which to hang your cap.\u201d \n                     Market watch \n                   \n                     Market watch \n                   \n                     No more hot air \n                   \n                     Western states launch carbon scheme \n                   \n                     Is the global carbon market working? \n                   \n                     Climate Change in Focus \n                   \n                     RGGI \n                   \n                     Point Carbon \n                   \n                     New Carbon Finance \n                   \n                     The Pew Center on Global Climate Change \n                   \n                     EEX Emissions Allowance price data \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Many of the world's indigenous livestock breeds are in danger of dying out as commercial breeds take over, according to a worldwide inventory of animal diversity. Their extinction would mean the loss of genetic resources that help animals overcome disease and drought, particularly in the developing world, say livestock experts. \"Valuable breeds are disappearing at an alarming rate,\" says Carlos Ser\u00e9, director general of the International Livestock Research Institute in Nairobi, Kenya, one of the organizations involved in the survey. The entire inventory, compiled by the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization, contains details of some 7,600 breeds of cattle, pigs, sheep, poultry and other animals in 169 countries. The survey reports that 11% of the investigated breeds are now extinct (some having disappeared many decades ago), 16% are currently at risk, 38% are unthreatened, and the security of the remaining 35% is unknown.  Discussing the findings at a meeting of policy-makers, breeders and livestock scientists in Interlaken, Switzerland, Ser\u00e9 called for the establishment of 'gene banks' containing frozen sperm and eggs from endangered breeds, similar to the facilities currently being set up to preserve the world's crop strains.  \n              Locally sourced \n           Local breeds, nearly 70% of which are found in the developing world, are often better suited to their environments than commercially marketed animals bred for their high yields and short-term profitability, Ser\u00e9 argues. Red Maasai sheep, for example, are naturally resistant to intestinal parasites, and Uganda's indigenous Ankole cattle are particularly drought-hardy. But the dominance of big breeding companies, mostly based in industrialized countries, means that these populations are being supplanted by the most common commercial breeds. Holstein-Friesian cattle, the stereotypical black-and-white dairy cow, are now found in more than 120 countries throughout the world. The spread of such animals means that many farmers are now working with livestock that are poorly adapted to their environment, Ser\u00e9 says. \"Until recently, natural selection allowed animals to adapt, but now a lot of this is falling through the cracks,\" he says. The pursuit of high-yielding animals means that genetic diversity is in crisis even in the established commercial breeds, says Shirley Ellis of the Institute for Animal Health in Compton, UK. She estimates that the roughly one billion Holstein-Friesians in the world were sired by the same few dozen bulls in North America. The advent of cloning for the most prized males will make the inbreeding problem worse still, she says. Exporting strains such as Holstein-Friesians to the developing world is short-sighted, experts point out. \"They don't cope very well with local climate and diseases,\" Ellis says.  \n              Banking for the future \n            Gene banks to preserve local diversity should be set up in the areas where this genetic diversity is found, argues Ser\u00e9. He wants to see an international effort to raise perhaps US$2 million to begin the process of establishing either national or regional centres for storing genetic material. \"Many rich countries are already setting up genetic stores, but we don't have it in the south where it's needed,\" he says. The main threat facing local livestock is the pre-eminence of short-termism in livestock breeding, and the fact that it is controlled by large Western companies, Ser\u00e9 says. But the political volatility of much of the developed world also plays a part, he argues.  In the wake of human conflicts such as the Darfur crisis, in which livestock were slaughtered by marauding militias, aid agencies can only replace these animals with Western breeds, Ser\u00e9 points out. But such animals are less valuable to local farmers in the long run.  Preserving the genetic heritage of indigenous breeds could also save breeders the trouble of trying to promote traits, such as drought-tolerance, from scratch. \"Breeding is sophisticated, but it's cheaper to spot a breed that can do the job already,\" Ser\u00e9 says. \"Nature may have already produced what you need.\" \n             Visit our  \n             \n                 newsblog \n               \n              to read and post comments about this story. \n           International Livestock Research Institute \n                   Food in focus \n                 \n                   Biotechnology news \n                 \n                   Ecology and evolution news \n                 \n                   Genetics news \n                 \n                   Report on Animal Genetic Resources \n                 \n                   FAO conference \n                 \n                   International Livestock Research Institute \n                 \n                   Institute for Animal Health \n                 Reprints and Permissions"},

Carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) isn't the only atmospheric pollutant making the oceans more acidic and threatening the health of coral reefs and plankton. New research suggests that nitrogen and sulphur released into the air by human activities may be driving down the pH more than expected in some coastal waters. Increasing CO 2  levels are expected to change the acidity of the Earth's waters from 8.2 to about 7.8 by the end of this century. But less attention has been paid to the effects on the acidity of ocean waters of the nitrogen and sulphur compounds emitted by fertilizers and fossil fuels. The reasons for this neglect are simple. Although atmospheric nitrogen and sulphur compounds are well known for showering the Earth with acid rain, the vast volume and mighty buffering power of the sea was thought to makes oceans resilient to this effect. Added to that is the simple issue of scale. Humans add 6 teramoles of reactive nitrogen and 2 teramoles of sulphur to the atmosphere every year, says geochemist Ken Caldeira of Stanford University in California. In contrast, yearly release of CO 2  is 700 teramoles. \"Based on this consideration alone, one might expect the acidification from CO 2  emissions to be nearly 100 times greater than the acidification resulting from nitrogen and sulphur emissions,\" he says. When Scott Doney of Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Massachusetts and his colleagues modelled the impacts of nitrogen and sulphur compounds on ocean acidity, their results supported the idea that, in general, nitrogen and sulphur contribute only a small percentage of the effect of CO 2  to ocean acidification. But, they report in  Proceedings of the National Academies of Sciences USA  this week 1 , in some areas these gases have 10-50% of the impact of CO 2 .  \n              Local impact \n            \"On the global scale, if you add them all up, the impacts of nitrogen and sulphur are small,\" says Doney. \"But when you start looking at spatial and regional impacts, they can be pretty important.\"  The hardest-hit areas would be those closest to the sites where air pollution is taking place, because reactive nitrogen and sulphur compounds tend to come raining back down to Earth within days to a week of being emitted, giving them little time to travel.  Oceanographers say it is clear that these elements can increase acidity. But the scale of the effect predicted by Doney is surprising.  \"I would be surprised that coastal areas are so sensitive to this input,\" adds biological oceanographer Ulf Riebesell of the Leibniz Institute of Marine Sciences in Kiel, Germany. He says he would expect physical and biological effects to mediate the acid \u2014 adding nitrogen also stimulates plankton productivity, for example, which in turn lowers the concentration of dissolved inorganic carbon and makes water more alkaline. But Doney's model accounts for such effects and still comes up with a hefty impact on ocean acidity.  While nitrogen and sulphur may contribute more to acidification of coastal waters, they remain only a small part of the full picture, adds Caldeira. \"There are plenty of good reasons to curtail emissions of both sulphur and reactive nitrogen,\" he says. \"However, if we are concerned about diminishing the threat posed by ocean acidification, we must work much, much harder to decrease our CO 2  emissions \u2014 these must be decreased dramatically and soon.\" \n             Visit our  \n             \n                 newsblog \n               \n              to read and post comments about this story. \n           \n                   Nature Reports: Climate Change \n                 \n                   Climate Feedback blog \n                 \n                    The Ocean Acidification Network \n                 Reprints and Permissions"},

But even the most sensitive of modern cleaning techniques come with problems \u2014 which one researcher says he can solve with a gel sponge and a magnet. Many current conservation techniques use specially designed gels that can be placed on isolated dirty spots of a painting. In this way, specific cleaners can be applied to a small area of an artwork without the cleansing gel running or removing the paint along with the dirt. But getting the sticky gel off at the end can be tricky. Residue of gel and cleaner can remain both on and under the surface being cleaned, marring the art. And using any kind of abrasive removal technique on a delicate painting comes with its own problems. Piero Baglioni, a chemist at the University of Florence, Italy, says he has found a way around these problems \u2014 by creating a gel that can be removed with a magnet.  \"It will replace the old method because it's easier,\" Baglioni says. Baglioni and his colleagues detail their production of a gel sponge containing magnetic nanoparticles in the latest issue of the journal  Langmuir 1 .  \n              Sponge bath \n           Baglioni's gel consists mainly of a polymer (polyethylene glycol and acrylamide) impregnated with iron nanoparticles. This gel is firm enough to be cut with scissors into 'sponges' of specific shapes required for cleaning. Such sponges can be loaded with a wide array of cleaning materials, as required for oil paintings or marble sculptures for example, and applied to the parts of the artwork that need cleaning.  Once applied, the cleanser leaches onto the top surface of the artwork, where it should dissolve the dirt to be removed. As the upper surface of the gel dries during the cleaning process, an osmotic pressure gradient is set up within the gel that then pulls the cleaning solution back into the sponge and away from the surface of the painting or sculpture. This trick works thanks to the fact that the gel is generally more inclined to soak up water-based substances than the surfaces being treated.  Simply placing a magnet above the piece of gel then removes it from the painting's surface without damaging the art. \"To the best of our knowledge, the ... responsive chemical gel represents one of the most advanced, versatile systems for cleaning works of art, avoiding any side effects,\" the researchers write in their paper.  Aviva Burnstock, head of the Department of Conservation & Technology at London's Courtauld Institute of Art, notes the importance of being able to remove the sponge as well as the cleaning material that the sponge was impregnated with.  What's interesting about Baglioni's system, she says, is how his sponge can be used to treat such small areas; other gels are not necessarily so good at limiting how much of the painting is exposed to the cleaner. \"It's not a bad idea,\" she says. \"It could be useful for very delicate surfaces.\" \n             Visit our  \n             \n                 newsblog \n               \n              to read and post comments about this story. \n           \n                   Langmuir \n                 Reprints and Permissions"},

Researchers behind a major trial on breast-cancer prevention whose funding was cancelled in June say that Elias Zerhouni, director of the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) has indicated that he may be willing to meet them. The trial was to have received US$55 million from the National Cancer Institute (NCI). It would have involved almost 13,000 postmenopausal women at a high risk of developing breast cancer, and aimed to investigate the efficacy of two cancer drugs \u2014 letrozole and raloxifene \u2014 in preventing the disease. It was initially approved by NCI staff, external reviewers and, in January, by an executive committee of senior NCI leaders. But the next day, NCI director John Niederhuber put the funding on hold. He convened an ad hoc committee to study the costly trial further. Niederhuber later cancelled the funding, partly over fears of giving healthy women pills with known side effects and the public's reluctance to take preventative medicines. Previous studies, he wrote, \u201chave failed to change the practice of breast cancer prevention among women and their [doctors], perhaps because of the side effects of these drugs\u201d. The scientists leading the trial at the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project, based in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, protested vehemently, and accused Niederhuber of \u201cacting unilaterally\u201d. On 20 July, they hand-delivered a 13-page appeal to Zerhouni, asking him to intervene. Last week they said, \u201cwe've had some very positive interactions\u201d with Zerhouni's office, and they are hopeful of meeting him this month. The appeal has drawn media attention in the United States, and in a recent editorial  The Lancet  labelled Niederhuber's actions \u201ctroubling\u201d and called for an investigation ( Lancet   369,  2134; 2007 ). But Bruce Chabner of Massachusetts General Hospital, who chaired Niederhuber's ad hoc committee, says that the NIH's frozen budget has forced Niederhuber to make tough fiscal choices. He adds that the panel was strongly influenced by the fact that letrozole, made by Novartis, goes off-patent in 2011. \u201cWas it worth spending millions on a trial that might never result in a drug being used for this indication?\u201d he asks. \u201cWe thought it likely it wasn't.\u201d \n                     News Analysis \n                   \n                     The zero effect \n                   \n                     Focus on breast cancer \n                   \n                     New Horizons in Cancer Research \n                   \n                     Cancer supplement \n                   \n                     Cell division and cancer supplement \n                   \n                     Signalling in cancer \n                   \n                     Clinical practice and research \n                   \n                     National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project \n                   \n                     National Cancer Institute breast cancer home page \n                   \n                     National Breast Cancer Coalition position statement on tamoxifen and raloxifene in healthy women \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

The legend of Jason and the Argonauts' heroic quest for the Golden Fleece may provide a fascinating window into real Bronze Age society, say researchers who believe they have found the earliest evidence of a trading gold mine. The adventure, which was set about 1300  BC  \u2014 a generation before the Trojan war described by Homer \u2014 involves a mission to capture the precious fleece from Colchis, in modern-day Georgia. The mythological fleece has been interpreted in various ways, but is thought by some to symbolize the vast wealth and gold of Georgia. Although gold was used and traded in ancient times, there has been scant evidence of where the precious metal used in Eurasia during the Bronze Age originated, and whether it was mined or panned from rivers. Gold mines in the Upper Nile region of Egypt and elsewhere in Africa date from 2,500  BC  and are believed to have supplied the Ancient Egyptians' needs. But the legend of the Golden Fleece hints at a thriving gold trade in the Caucasus dating back further than was first thought. In 2004, a team of German and Georgian archaeologists discovered what may be the world's oldest gold mine at Sakdrissi, about 70 kilometres southwest of Tbilisi. Thomas St\u00f6llner and Andreas Hauptmann of Ruhr University in Bochum, Germany, and Irina Gambashidze, an archaeologist from the Centre of Archaeological Studies in Tbilisi, dated the mine to around 3000  BC . Now, the researchers have produced evidence that suggests this mine was trading as far back as 2500  BC . The team analysed samples of gold from the mine and compared them with gold from some 25 ancient artefacts dating from 2500 to 1500  BC  in the Bronze Age. The beautifully worked pieces, housed in museum collections in Georgia and neighbouring countries, include needles, necklaces and rings. The gold was analysed using a process called LA\u2013ICP\u2013MS (laser ablation\u2013inductively coupled plasma\u2013mass spectrometry), in which a tiny layer of surface metal is vaporized and the various elements in the vapour are identified by their mass. The ratio of trace elements in the gold helps to pinpoint where it came from. In this case, the team found similar levels of lead and osmium in the gold from the mine in Sakdrissi as in the artefacts. But the clincher was the unusually high amount of antimony in the artefacts, which is characteristic of the particular geochemistry at Sakdrissi. Although this suggests a strong link between the mine and the artefacts, it is possible that the gold used was not mined, but panned from rivers in the local area. Villagers in parts of Georgia are still reported to pan the rivers for gold using sheep fleeces \u2014 another potential link to the tale of the Golden Fleece. Gold obtained from rivers tends to contain elevated levels of metals such as osmium, tin and palladium, so the archaeologists are now assessing the osmium levels in gold taken from the river to see whether the gold in the artefacts was panned or mined. Fingerprinting gold is one of the most difficult tasks in archaeometry, says Maria-Filomena Guerra, a physicist at the Centre for Research and Restoration of the Museums of France in Paris, who is separately trying to follow the gold trail. Guerra's team has been analysing gold artefacts from a Mycenaean tomb at Kazanaki near Volos, the modern Greek town close to the area where legend says Jason came from. The tomb dates from 1400  BC  and Guerra has so far analysed a gold-beaded necklace and gold leaf interred there, using a technique called PIXE XRF (particle-induced X-ray emission X-ray fluorescence). Guerra found levels of tin, platinum and palladium in the tomb samples that indicate the gold came from a river source and was almost certainly panned for, she says. She now plans further analyses to prove her hunch that the gold was panned in Georgia. \n                     Archaeology: Deep divisions \n                   \n                     Joan of Arc's relics exposed as forgery \n                   \n                     Were ancient Minoans centuries ahead of their time? \n                   \n                     Twice-rescued Bronze Age disc goes on public view \n                   \n                     St\u00f6llner research project in brief \n                   \n                     Golden Fleece in Wikipedia \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

The Walt Disney Company is going toe-to-toe with the University of Washington in Seattle after a study by the university's researchers suggested that exposure to DVDs and videos for babies, including Disney's Baby Einstein, could be associated with poorer language development.

In a letter to the university, he accused it of issuing a \u201cdeliberately misleading, irresponsible and derogatory\u201d press release. \u201cWhether your university is comfortable associating its name with analysis of this quality is, of course, your decision,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAnd I would not be reaching out to you if all that was at stake was a poorly done academic study.\u201d What is at stake is a million-dollar industry in such products for babies. A full set of Baby Einstein DVDs costs US$369.99. Baby Einstein packaging says it \u201cis not designed to make babies smarter\u201d, but detractors claim such products are marketed as educational. \u201cDisney is expecting the brand to bring in $1 billion by 2010,\u201d says psychologist Susan Linn of Harvard Medical School in Boston, Massachusetts, and a founder of the Boston-based Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood, a group opposed to marketing to children. In May 2006 the campaign asked the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to investigate Baby Einstein and Brainy Baby of Alpharetta, Georgia, another leading manufacturer of baby videos, for \u201cengaging in deceptive acts and practices\u201d. They were backed by the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry. The complaint is still being considered. Linn sees the entire 'baby industry' becoming more litigious. \u201cWe can expect more of this kind of corporate intimidation,\u201d she warns. \u201cDisney is on the defensive and they're going to come out swinging.\u201d The study, published online earlier this month (F. Zimmerman  et al .  J. Pediatr.  doi:10.1016/j.jpeds.2007.04.071; 2007 ), found that babies aged 8 to 16 months who watched such videos scored lower than other babies on the Communicative Development Inventory (CDI), a standard tool used to gauge language development in infants. Babies that watched an hour a day scored 17 points lower on the CDI scale \u2014 corresponding to knowing seven fewer words than a typical baby in the study who did not watch the videos, the researchers say. Lead author Frederick Zimmerman suggests several explanations for their findings, including the fact that parents worried about their child's language development might turn to the videos. But \u201cit is possible that heavy viewing of baby DVDs/videos has a deleterious effect on early language development,\u201d he says. The study was press-released by his university under the headline \u201cBaby DVDs, videos may hinder, not help, infants' language development\u201d. University president Mark Emmert has refused to retract the press release and says he stands behind the research. \u201cThe findings were considered significant enough to be reported in a major journal, and as a public institution we feel duty bound to make the public aware of these findings,\u201d he says. Deborah Linebarger, an expert in child development and television at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, was asked by Disney to defend Baby Einstein to the FTC. Although believing such products can be useful, she declined. \u201cI have concerns that anything called Baby Einstein, Genius, etcetera, is exploitive of a vulnerable population,\u201d she says.

It's official: biology postgraduates in the United States face greater competition for tenure than ever before. A wealth of data released this month will reopen discussions about employment and training in the US biomedical system. The data, compiled by the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology (FASEB) ( http://opa.faseb.org/pages/PolicyIssues/training_datappt.htm ), are from many sources, including the US National Science Foundation (NSF), the Council of Graduate Schools and the National Institutes of Health (NIH). And one message is clear: increasing numbers of bright young students are eager for a career in biology and biomedicine, but fewer than before will gain the coveted tenured academic positions. NSF data show that the number of students in US graduate programmes in the biological sciences has increased steadily since 1966. In 2005, around 7,000 graduates earned a doctorate. But the number of biomedical PhDs with academic tenure has remained steady since 1981, at just over 20,000. During that period the percentage of US biomedical PhDs with tenure or tenure-track jobs dropped from nearly 45% to just below 30%. So where do all the graduate students end up? The percentage of biomedical PhDs going into industry has tripled, from 10% to 30%, since the 1970s, the NSF reports. But those who stay on the academic track face a more arduous slog than their mentors. Although numbers of applicants for postdoctoral fellowships awarded by the NIH increased between 2002 and 2006, the percentage who were successful dropped sharply (see graphic). And the average age of scientists earning their first R01 grant \u2014 the NIH's bread-and-butter grant to an independent researcher \u2014 has risen from 34 in 1970 to 42 now. The percentage of PhDs still in a postdoctoral fellowship three or four years after their doctorate has declined since 1997, from 45% to 30%, although the total number of postdocs grew from about 25,000 to 33,000 in the same period. What does this mean for biology and biomedicine as a career option? It's more than an abstract question to Howard Garrison, director of FASEB's office of public affairs, who has a college-bound daughter. \u201cShe's thinking of biological sciences, so I tell her don't give up, but make sure you're realistic about your future,\u201d Garrison says. \u201cPeople are drawn to the biological sciences because it's an exciting field and an exciting time, but people have to have a broad and flexible approach to their careers.\u201d A huge question is why the doubling of the NIH budget from 1998 to 2003 seems not to have helped young scientists. Most of the money went into infrastructure rather than tenure-track jobs (see  Nature   443 , 894; doi:10.1038/443894a 2006 ). The NIH dollars devoted to training fellowships did grow, but not as fast as the rest of its budget, and when the NIH budget stopped growing, so did the dollars (see graphic). Most NIH-supported postdoc appointments are now financed by research grants, not training grants. \u201cIf you're being supported to do research on research grants, but you're still a postdoc, there's a tension, because you're not being funded to be trained,\u201d says Jodi Lubetsky of the Association of American Medical Colleges. Norka Ruiz Bravo, deputy director for extramural research at the NIH, says the agency welcomes the FASEB report: \u201cFASEB has performed a very useful and timely service for the biomedical research community in highlighting this important issue. It is a matter of great interest and concern for NIH.\u201d The NIH recently instituted the Pathways to Independence awards, which help postdocs set up their own labs.

In 2005, a team led by Harry Bryden, an oceanographer at the University of Southampton, UK, reported a 30% decrease in the MOC at 26.5\u00b0 north, after comparing their measurements from ship-based instruments in 2004 with similar data from 1957, 1981, 1992 and 1998 (H. L. Bryden, H. R. Longworth and S. A. Cunningham  Nature   438 , 655\u2013657; 2005). They did caution at the time that, due to the scarcity of observations, the error bounds of their study were exceptionally wide. Nevertheless, the finding fuelled fears of an imminent collapse of the thermohaline Atlantic circulation \u2014 the ocean conveyor driven by temperature and salinity differences that gives rise to the Gulf Stream, allowing western Europe to enjoy a relatively mild climate. Alarmist headlines warned that a mini ice age would hit Britain. However, 12 months' worth of data from an array of moored instruments, deployed during the same 2004 cruise that yielded the most recent measurements included in Bryden's study, now suggest that the observed changes were due to short-term variability and not the result of global warming. Stuart Cunningham of the National Oceanography Centre in Southampton and his colleagues found that the strength of the overturning circulation varied wildly \u2014 by a factor of 8 \u2014 between March 2004 and March 2005 (S. A. Cunningham  et al .  Science   317 , 935\u2013937; 2007 ). Bryden, who was also involved in the new study, had unknowingly probed the ocean during a period of relatively low circulation, they conclude. \u201cI guess we can give [thermohaline] the all-clear,\u201d says Jochem Marotzke, an oceanographer at the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology in Hamburg, Germany, formerly principal investigator of Rapid Climate Change (RAPID), a monitoring programme funded by the UK Natural Environment Research Council. The Atlantic sensor array, which is to remain operational until 2014, is part of the RAPID programme. Available data provide no statistically significant evidence for a change of the overturning circulation over the past 50 years, says Marotzke, a co-author on the new study. From now, the RAPID system should allow researchers to detect circulation changes from one year to the next, provided the average circulation volume changes by 20% or more. But because the unknown variability from year to year may also be large, it will take at least ten more years of continuous measurements until a possible downward trend will become recognizable in the data noise. But Bryden remains unconvinced that the RAPID measurements in the new study have rendered his initial findings null and void. The depth of the thermocline \u2014 the layer of rapid heat transfer between the mixed-water layer at the surface and deep-ocean water \u2014 varies across the basin from west to mid-ocean, changing the recirculation of water. An increase in the slope of the thermocline along with the observed freshening of deep water near the Bahamas, do indicate a 10\u201315% decline in average circulation since 1980, Bryden maintains. \u201cRAPID is quite an achievement,\u201d Bryden says. \u201cBut I don't share the opinion that our previous results are just due to seasonal variability. It may not be statistically reliable, but all the science points to a slow down of the Atlantic circulation.\u201d \n                     Decades needed to tell whether ocean currents are slowing \n                   \n                     Climate change: A sea change \n                   \n                     Climate Change in focus \n                   \n                     RAPID programme \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Most claims that men and women are affected differently by disease-associated gene variations are poorly founded. A team of researchers has found that the data supporting such claims are often poorly analysed statistically or come from studies that were not adequately designed to show these links. \u201cThe abysmal standard of statistical analysis in much of genetic epidemiology is little short of scandalous,\u201d says David Balding, professor of statistical genetics at Imperial College London, UK, who was not involved in the study. \u201cThis paper reveals an entire industry of prominently reported results that are largely unjustified and probably mostly false.\u201d John Ioannidis and his colleagues at the University of Ioannina School of Medicine in Greece evaluated 432 claims in 77 research papers (N. Patsopoulos  et al .  J. Am. Med. Assoc.   298,  880\u2013893; 2007 ). The team applied a set of criteria to determine whether the papers' authors had performed the correct analysis, such as comparing like with like, and had taken steps to show that the association was not due to chance. Worryingly, only 12.7% of claims satisfied these criteria. \u201cThere is quite a gap between what should have been done and what the journals and reviewers should have asked for, compared with what the authors did,\u201d says Ioannidis. Many studies were not designed to test for a link between sex and gene variants, with researchers trying to extract associations from their data after the fact. Sample sizes were at least ten times smaller than they needed to be to yield statistically robust results, Ioannidis adds. \u201cThis paper tells us that we don't have a clue whether gender is a real biomarker for any of the clinical areas assessed,\u201d says Howard McLeod, director of the UNC Institute for Pharmacogenomics and Individualized Therapy in Chapel Hill, North Carolina. \u201cGender, as well as age and race, are crude ways of understanding the complex factors regulating clinical effect,\u201d he adds.

A branch of mathematics known as K-theory has this month seen its flagship journal bifurcate in a strange dispute, the details of which were still emerging as  Nature  went to press. The events centre on Anthony Bak, a mathematician at the University of Bielefeld in Germany and until recently managing editor of the Springer journal  K-Theory . Bak left the monthly journal, due, he says, to production problems and a too-high subscription rate. He has arranged to launch a rival title with another publisher that has offered a lower subscription rate, in the process shedding some editors unhappy at how the shift has been managed. In seeking to cut prices, the editors follow the lead of the editorial board of the Elsevier mathematics journal  Topology , which quit to launch a competing non-profit title (see  Nature   445 , 351; 2007). The cover date of the last issue of the supposedly monthly  K-Theory  was April 2006. Bak has withheld all papers accepted by the journal since then \u2014 a situation that not all of the editors, or the papers' authors, seem to have been aware of until recently. In January 2007, the publisher sacked Bak. That month Bak wrote to his editorial board members asking them to resign en masse, which they did. As well as the cost of the journal, he mentioned production problems at Springer. But he neglected to tell Springer of the resignations. \u201cAt no point did Bak communicate to Springer directly that the board had resigned,\u201d says Catriona Byrne, editorial director for mathematics at Springer. It was only in May that Springer learned that the board had resigned. In August, Bak announced publicly that he had arranged to launch a rival title, the  Journal of K-Theory , with Cambridge University Press at a lower subscription rate. Springer has now said that it will lower the  K-Theory  subscription rate. Eric Friedlander at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois, a former editor at  K-Theory , is in principle sympathetic to the switch. \u201cThere is a lot of concern in the mathematics community about the cost of journals,\u201d he says. But on 17 August, Friedlander wrote to Bak to say that despite being named as a member of the editorial board of the new journal, he was not willing to serve \u201cbecause I cannot endorse the process by which you have withheld manuscripts submitted to  K-Theory  and proceeded without consultation with authors and the editorial board\u201d. One of the editors who resigned, Andrew Ranicki of the University of Edinburgh, UK, has returned to the Springer journal. He and mathematician Wolfgang L\u00fcck of the University of M\u00fcnster, Germany, issued a statement on 13 August to say that they would act as interim managing editors for the journal. Bak launched  K-Theory  in the 1980s and ran it successfully for many years. He became increasingly unhappy after Springer acquired the journal through its merger with Kluwer Academic Publishers in 2004. Bak says that the editorial board agreed in 2004 to consider moving to a different publisher. Byrne admits there were some teething problems, but says these were being or had been dealt with. She adds that Bak failed to send sufficient manuscripts to fill the journal and that those he did send arrived erratically, creating difficulties with the workflow. Bak confirms that after April 2006 he stopped sending Springer the manuscripts passed on to him by  K-Theory 's other editors. Friedlander is uncomfortable that papers were held up: \u201cOur responsibility is to review mathematics that is submitted to us and disseminate it.\u201d L\u00fcck calls it \u201ca scandal\u201d. Another former editor says they understood the backlog at Springer to have been so bad that the withholding of the papers would have made little difference to when they appeared. Byrne says: \u201cThis is definitely a misconception.\u201d L\u00fcck and Ranicki have asked authors to contact them if they have papers accepted by  K-Theory  that they want to be published in the journal. Meanwhile, Bak has offered authors publication in the new  Journal of K-Theory . K-theory, which is concerned with the algebraic properties of space, has had some high-profile moments. One major contributor to the field, Hyman Bass of the University of Michigan, received a US National Medal of Science on 27 July. But K-theory remains a relatively small discipline, which does not need more than one dedicated journal. For this reason, Ranicki and L\u00fcck said on 17 August that they will not try to continue  K-Theory , but deal only with the papers that have already been accepted. \n                     Rebels hold their own in journal price war \n                   \n                     PS I want all the rights \n                   \n                     Sackings put editorial freedom on the spot \n                   \n                     Access to the literature web focus \n                   \n                     K-theory journal homepage \n                   \n                     News about K-theory on a journal-watch wiki \n                   \n                     Wikipeda on the mathematics of K-theory \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

The last common ancestor of humans and gorillas might have lived at least 2 million years earlier than previously thought. Fossilized teeth of the earliest gorilla ever discovered, dating to 10 million years ago, have been found in Africa, say researchers. The new species ( Chororapithecus abyssinicus ) from Ethiopia, reported on  page 921  of this issue, helps to fill in a huge gap in the fossil record. The team of Ethiopian and Japanese researchers has based its conclusion on just nine teeth from at least three individuals of the species, which were discovered in the desert scrubland of Afar about 170 kilometres east of Addis Ababa. The teeth, eight molars and a canine, \u201care collectively indistinguishable from modern gorilla subspecies\u201d in size, proportion and scan-revealed internal structure, says Gen Suwa of the University of Tokyo Museum, Japan, who led the study. The team argues that the gorilla's divergence date from the human lineage is not about 8 million years ago as previously surmised (S. Kumar  et al .  Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA   102,  18842\u201318847; 2005 ), but \u201cgreater than 10 to 11 million years ago\u201d on the basis of the age of the new species. Functionally, he adds, the teeth already seem to be evolving \u2014 they could shear through a plant diet, a gorilla trait \u2014 although other herbivore apes also exist in the fossil record. This finding could prompt discussions of how anthropologists and geneticists determine the hominin line's divergence from chimps, previously pegged at about 6 million years ago. \u201c Chororapithecus abyssinicus  suggests, once again, that Africa was the place of origin of both humans and modern African apes\u201d \u2014 not Eurasia as some researchers have argued, says Suwa. But palaeoanthropologist Jay Kelley, who studies primate teeth at the University of Illinois at Chicago and was not involved in the study, is sceptical. \u201cI'm not convinced it is a gorilla,\u201d he says. More fossils, analysis and debate will be needed to determine whether the specimen is ancestral to hominids, he adds. For now, he would be \u201cvery cautious\u201d about using the specimen to realign divergence dates between hominins and gorillas\u2013chimps. Suwa's team is part of the Revealing Human Origins Initiative (RHOI), a project that searches at multiple sites in Africa, Europe and Asia for species that predate the earliest known hominid, the 7-million-year-old  Sahelanthropus tchadensis  (M. Brunet  et al .  Nature   418 , 145\u2013151; 2002). Between 15 million and 22 million years ago, there were dozens of primate species across Africa and Euroasia \u2014 and apes dominated the primate scene. But fossils show that these species don't share the characteristics of modern African apes. \u201cFrom that species pool, the common ancestor of African apes and humans branched out,\u201d says Tim White, a palaeoanthropologist at the University of California, Berkeley, and an RHOI director. \u201cAnd the goal of RHOI is to find the common ancestors.

Scientists have erased a long-term memory in the brains of laboratory rats, offering insight into how such memories are stored. Yadin Dudai and Reut Shema of the Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovot, Israel, trained rodents to associate a particular smell with illness. Injecting the rat brains up to a month later with a polypeptide called ZIP caused the rats to completely forget the unpleasant memory, they report in  Science 1 . The study suggests that even though long-term memories can last for years or even for a lifetime, they are constantly maintained by an ever-active process. That goes against previous ideas that long-term memories are simply held in safe, static storage says co-author Todd Sacktor, a neuroscientist at State University of New York Downstate Medical Center in Brooklyn. \"The result is surprising because most people would basically say it's impossible to erase a memory like this,\" says Sacktor. Most neuroscientists think that relatively permanent changes in the shape and physiology of neurons help store long-term memories, he says.  \n              Sweet memories \n           Researchers already knew that if they caught the formation of a memory within minutes, they could wipe it from the brain's hippocampus with chemicals that stop neurons from making new proteins. But it was unclear what might happen after this time window passed, when memories are thought to be shunted to another part of the brain - the cortex \u2014 for long-term storage. \"What's been completely unknown \u2014  terra incognita  \u2014 is what happens next,\" says Sacktor. To find out, the team first trained rats to avoid the scent of saccharin by exposing them to the sweet smell, then feeding them lithium \u2014 a metal that makes them sick. Rats given this treatment soon learn to avoid water smelling of saccharin. They then looked to see what would happen if they injected the rat cortex with ZIP, a small protein Sacktor's laboratory previously used to block spatial memories held in the hippocampus. ZIP silences an enzyme called PKM-zeta, which Sacktor thinks is key to perpetuating long-term memory.  The rats given such a shot, even up to a month after learning to avoid saccharin, lost their memory of the bad experience and happily drank the sweet water. To search for any remaining trace of the memory, the researchers tried reminding the mice of the link by giving them lithium again. But the ZIP-treated mice kept swigging the sweetener-water. \"No matter what we did, the memory never came back,\" says Sacktor.  \n              Spanner in the works \n            The team suggests that PKM-zeta could maintain memory by creating new receptors for neurotransmitter molecules, says Dudai. A so-far unidentified mechanism that keeps this enzyme active would then be crucial for keeping hold of long-term memories. By blocking PKM-zeta, ZIP may halt this process. \"It's like placing a stick in an engine. The minute you stop it the memory collapses,\" says Dudai.  David Glanzman, a neuroscientist at the University of California, Los Angeles, is not completely convinced that the rats' memories have been fully erased. He says that if experiments show the effect lasts for a year, he would be swayed.  The researchers \u2014 who are expecting a lasting effect \u2014 are now testing to see whether the memories stay erased for longer periods of time. \"I think there's going to be an avalanche of studies following up on this,\" Glanzman says. \n             Visit our  \n             \n                 newsblog \n               \n              to read and post comments about this story. \n           University of California, Los Angeles \n                   Dudai Lab \n                 Reprints and Permissions"},

In the movie  28 Days Later  a deadly virus escapes from a British research lab and wreaks havoc across the country. That was fiction, but concerns about lab safety are not. It is now nearly certain that the foot-and-mouth virus discovered on 3 August in cattle near Guildford, UK, originated at the nearby animal-research facility in Pirbright. The incident seems to have been due to an accidental leak of the virus from either the government-run Institute for Animal Health (IAH) or commercial vaccine manufacturer Merial Animal Health, which share the Pirbright facility. Merial said last week that it \u201chas complete confidence in its safety and environmental protection\u201d. The IAH also says it does not know of any security breaches and is cooperating with the inspectors. This latest incident highlights the problems that can occur with the security of so-called 'dual-use' research \u2014 work that could be of use to terrorists as well as to legitimate researchers (see  'Laboratory lapses' ). Investigations into the foot-and-mouth outbreak are ongoing, but engineering or personnel failure must have been to blame if the virus escaped from a secure lab, in the opinion of Keith Plumb, a bioprocess engineer at the Institution of Chemical Engineers in London. It could have emerged only through the ventilation system, in waste, or on people, he says. Waste should be sterilized before disposal in the sewers, either by steam or chemicals. Damage to filters in the negative-pressure air system, for example, could have given the virus a possible exit route, says Plumb. Lab workers are fully covered by a gown, with only their eyes exposed, and must enter the lab via air-locks. After leaving the lab and removing the gown, researchers must shower to get rid of any contamination that might have occurred. Not taking enough time to shower is another possible exit route for the virus, Plumb says. \u201cThese kinds of breaches happen frequently in labs,\u201d he says, although usually with no serious consequences. The 2001 anthrax attacks in the United States were a rude awakening for biosecurity, and experts are now warning that biologists need to engage more seriously with the dual-use issue. The prospect of a deliberate release of dangerous biological material is of increasing concern, whether through lab break-ins or by research personnel. The failed terrorist attacks in July in central London and at Glasgow airport seemed even more shocking when it emerged that many of the suspects were doctors. \u201cPeople can't just walk in off the street into labs, but if there was somebody who wished to do with bioagents what was done with these other things we'd have a job to safeguard against it,\u201d says Plumb. \n               Regulate or be regulated \n             National and international regulators are currently looking at whether lab safeguards are adequate and how rigorously they are applied. \u201cBiosecurity is probably still a little bit too lax,\u201d said Jens Kuhn, a virologist at Harvard Medical School who advises on arms control. In the United States, the most stringent regulations apply to labs working with 'select agents', which include Ebola virus, saxitoxin (a lethal toxin found in algae), foot-and mouth-disease virus and bird flu, are required to adhere to a stringent set of rules. Suggestions for site security in the rules include guard services, gated entry, biometric readers and locked storage units. In addition, inventory control and IT systems must be assessed. However, the US Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), which is responsible for regulating many dangerous materials, has identified \u201cserious weaknesses\u201d in the security of select agents in university laboratories. These problems were initially identified after a review of 11 universities in 2002. A follow-up investigation of 15 universities in 2004, the results of which were released last year, identified problems with 11 that \u201ccould have compromised the ability to safeguard select agents from accidental or intentional loss\u201d. Access controls, such as procedures for issuing electronic keys to sensitive areas, were problematic at six universities. Training for individuals with access to dangerous agents had either not been provided or not been documented at three universities. Inventory and access records were also a problem, with some records incomplete or \u201cdifficult to decipher\u201d. Contacted by  Nature , the DHHS insisted that all the weaknesses had been corrected. But the number of problems identified raises questions about the integrity of labs in general and biology labs in particular. \u201cIt's fair to say that unlike areas such as physics, biologists haven't had that kind of discussion in recent years,\u201d says Brian Rappert, a biosecurity expert at the University of Exeter, UK. Rappert has been running seminars on bio-security with Malcolm Dando, professor of international security at the University of Bradford, UK. They found that biosecurity awareness among the 1,600 biologists who attended their seminars was extremely low. \u201cOur regular finding was that very few of them had thought very much about these dual-use issues,\u201d says Dando This lack of engagement with security may come back to haunt biologists as the trend towards regulation accelerates. Reynolds Salerno, manager of the International Biological Threat Reduction programme at the US government's Sandia National Laboratories in Albuquerque, New Mexico, points out that the international community is beginning to consider the possibility that malicious individuals might acquire dangerous pathogens or toxins from a legitimate laboratory. \u201cThe biotechnology community does need to be more involved in helping government establish the risk of dual-use technology and at least provide cogent arguments not to over-regulate these new technologies,\u201d he told  Nature . Next year, countries including Britain, China, Germany and the United States will revisit the international Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention, to which more than 150 countries are signatories. \u201cOne of the questions is the whole issue of biosafety and oversight, awareness, codes of conduct,\u201d says Dando. \u201cWe'll see increasing attention from scientific bodies in the run up to that.\u201d Europe is also looking at biosecurity. In July, the European Commission released a consultation paper on bio-preparedness, noting that \u201cin some domains imperfect implementation of safety measures and the existence of security gaps may continue to pose a risk\u201d. Proposals on the cards include limiting the number of security-cleared researchers and accredited labs, mandatory courses on biosafety at university level and obliging researchers to adopt a professional code of conduct. With regulation already a burden, many researchers fear that more rules could be stifling. \u201cThe more security you have, the more impaired the research gets. It's definitely very difficult and gets more difficult by the year,\u201d says Kuhn. \u201cIn the US, in general the people who make these regulations don't consult with the scientists. Whereas physicists have been dealing with these issues for a very long time and have shown research can continue very successfully, biologists just see another hurdle in their grant writing, more paperwork and their papers disappearing. They get panicky.\u201d \n                     A defensive strategy \n                   \n                     Lab loses trio of plague mice \n                   \n                     Synthetic biologists face up to security issues \n                   \n                     US biosecurity advisory board faces delicate balancing act \n                   \n                     The 1918 flu virus is resurrected \n                   \n                     Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention (BTWC) website \n                   \n                     European Commission consultation paper (pdf) \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

A tool that ranks researchers by the quality of their work is also a good predictor of their future performance 1 , according to its designer, physicist Jorge Hirsch at the University of California, San Diego. The h-index was first proposed in 2005 by Hirsch 2 , and attracted immense interest from scientists because of its claimed objectivity in ranking scientific achievement. Although other bibliometric measures of performance, such as counting up the number of papers published in  Nature  and  Science , have widely acknowledged shortcomings, they are still used to assess an individual's or department's research. Scientists generally prefer the alternative of assessment by peer review, but this process can be affected by subjectivity and bias. A fair and transparent method for gauging performance is greatly desired, especially by young scientists seeking tenure or academic placement. To this end, the British government has announced that after 2008, it will base funding assessments for universities purely on such a metric. But which to use? Counting the number of papers might give an undue advantage to scientists who publish lots of little consequence, or in small 'salami slices'. The number of citations is a better measure of a work's impact, but it can be distorted by a few highly cited papers among many indifferent ones. The ratio of these two measures \u2014 the mean number of citations per paper \u2014 is also a good indicator of performance 3 . But the h-index offers an alternative: it is the number  n  of a researcher's papers that have all received at least  n  citations. Thus, Frank Wilczek's h-index of 68 (see  'From the top down' ), means that 68 of his papers have been cited at least 68 times each. From a selection of well-cited papers in the journal  Physical Review B , Hirsch selected 50 authors who had started publishing papers in the 1980s, and assessed how their careers had developed. He calculated how well various metrics \u2014 the h-index, the number of publications (productivity), the number of citations and the mean number of citations \u2014 during the first 12 years of their publishing career predicted the values over the next 12. But rather than assessing the cumulative impact of previous and future work, he investigated how well the indices predicted the quality of subsequent work. Hirsch found that the h-index was slightly more accurate in this respect than the number of citations, and substantially better than the other two indices. It even predicted future productivity better than did past productivity. \u201cPerhaps prolific authors with small citation counts feel less incentive to continue being prolific, as they perceive that their work is not having an impact,\u201d he suggests. In other words, they decide that it's not worth trying so hard. Hirsch also shows how the h-index can discriminate in papers with multiple authors. \u201cI'm concerned about the blind way in which a co-author of a paper is allocated a full citation count for that paper, irrespective of his or her individual contribution,\u201d he says. The h-index automatically allocates a smaller proportion of the credit to the researchers who were likely to have contributed less, so \u201cit does a good job of unravelling that\u201d, he explains. One of the h-index's benefits, Hirsch claims, is that it is hard to manipulate by self-citation \u2014 researchers would have to cite many of their own papers many times to boost their h-index rating. But physicist Michael Schreiber, of the Technical University of Chemnitz in Germany, argues that self-citations can distort the value appreciably 4 , and he proposes that they be excluded to 'sharpen' the index. James Fowler, also of the University of California, San Diego, says that even when self-citations are removed from citation counts, those who cite themselves more seem to be more successful. His group found that more than half of the citations a scientist receives can be attributed directly or indirectly to self-citation 5 . Nonetheless, the h-index does seem to be able to identify good scientists, and it is becoming widely used informally, for example to rank applicants for research posts. \u201cPeople in various disciplines are using or considering using the h-index as one of the criteria both for appointments and for grants allocation\u201d, says Hirsch. \u201cI have seen several job applicants send us their h-index in their CV.\u201d Schreiber agrees that \u201cthe use of the h-index is increasing, at least unofficially.\u201d Whether you like it or not, he says, \u201cthe h-index is here to stay\u201d. However, Schreiber cautions, \u201cit is always a problem to reduce research work to one number. We should be careful using it and should be aware of its limitations.\u201d \n                     Top five in physics \n                   \n                     Brown's budget briefing \n                   \n                     Prestige is factored into journal ratings \n                   \n                     Index aims for fair ranking of scientists \n                   \n                     Hirsch paper \n                   \n                     Schreiber paper \n                   \n                     H-index \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Its resurgence now threatens middle-class urbanites in cities such as Singapore. Ewen Callaway asks whether Asia's ever-growing wealth will propel a treatment or vaccine to market. He was a 25-year-old rock-climber, educated to university level and from a middle-class family in Singapore. But last month, Ian Ng hit the headlines for the worst reason. He became the city-state's fourth and youngest victim of dengue fever this year. Ng was taken to hospital vomiting and feverish on 21 July, but he died from the mosquito-borne virus less than 24 hours later. The booming cities of southeast Asia are experiencing their worst dengue outbreak in a decade \u2014 early rains and unchecked urbanization have promoted the spread of the virus-carrying mosquitoes. Singapore, which almost managed to wipe out the pandemic disease in the 1980s, has already had 5,000 infections this year. In Indonesia, more than 100,000 people have contracted dengue and 1,100 have died, coming close to the figures for all of 2006, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). Malaysia, Cambodia, the Philippines, Myanmar and Thailand are all experiencing a similar surge in the disease. Monsoon flooding across India, Nepal and Bangladesh threatens to worsen the situation by causing an explosion in mosquito populations. Dengue infects at least 50 million people a year in more than 100 countries, mainly across Asia, Africa and South America. But unlike many diseases ravaging the developing world, dengue cuts across class. \u201cThis is not a disease of the poverty-stricken, rural farmer,\u201d agrees Scott Halstead, scientific director of the Seoul-based Pediatric Dengue Vaccine Initiative (PDVI), a non-profit organization launched in 2003 to drive a vaccine to market. In some developing countries, \u201cthe richer you are, the more likely you are to get dengue\u201d, he adds. This could be a reason for hope. Dengue still plagues the poor people in urban areas, who face the brunt of a disease with neither cure nor vaccine. But as Asian economies boom, dengue is starting to interest pharmaceutical companies. \u201cIt's been enormously helpful to the field to see the potential market value of a dengue vaccine increase, and that has everything to do with rising incomes in Latin America and Asia,\u201d says Bruce Innis, who heads vaccine development at GlaxoSmithKline (GSK). \u201cThe reason why GSK and Sanofi-Aventis are in this business is shrewd business judgement,\u201d says Halstead. Andrew Farlow, an economist at the University of Oxford, UK, who is working to determine the potential market for a dengue vaccine, says that there would be a substantial private market for a dengue vaccine in Asia and the Pacific. And the high economic toll that dengue takes in southeast Asia \u2014US$2.36 billion in the next 10 years according to the World Bank \u2014 means that middle- and high-income countries will be willing to pay more. Spread by the bite of the female  Aedes aegypti  mosquito, dengue is caused by four  Flavivirus  strains. Those infected develop high fever and debilitating joint pain that can leave them bedridden for weeks. Infection with one strain provides lifetime immunity against that strain, but not against the other three. In fact, immunity from one strain boosts the chances of having a much more severe illness, called dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF), because antibodies against another strain latch onto the virus and speed its entry into host cells. The result is immune overload, as blood vessels leak and the body goes into shock. \n               Target the hosts \n             Dengue fever isn't deadly, but DHF kills one in five if patients are not given adequate hospital support. More than 500,000 people \u2014 mostly children and infants \u2014 contract this more severe form of dengue, which kills 20,000 every year, making it a leading cause of childhood death in many countries. And the numbers are increasing. Without an effective drug or vaccine, the only way to stem dengue is to go after its host. The mosquitoes flourish in small pools of clean water outside homes \u2014 tyres and plastic containers are some of their favourite spots. Dengue is an almost exclusively urban disease \u2014 the WHO describes it as a \u201cman-made problem related to human behaviour\u201d. \u201cIf they breed, you will bleed,\u201d warns a pamphlet being distributed by the Singapore government that features a menacing mosquito. Unlike other countries in southeast Asia, Singapore has spent millions on mosquito control and surveillance, keeping a daily map of dengue hot spots. Citizens are fined up to S$200 (US$132) if mosquitoes are found on their property. But these measures haven't stemmed the virus's spread in recent years, largely because of ineffective programmes in other countries, says Duane Gubler, a dengue expert at the University of Hawaii in Honolulu. An influx of workers from neighbouring countries in which the disease is endemic transmits the virus to small pockets of mosquitoes in Singapore, Gubler says. Worse, decades of low infection rates have left the country's population with little immunity and now fewer mosquitoes are needed to spark an outbreak. Until recently, there has been scant financial support for research and development of vaccines and treatments. But coinciding with an economic boom in affected cities, drug companies have begun pumping in money and manpower (see  'Research frontline' ). Dengue's immediate potential public and private market is unprecedented, says Harold Margolis, director of PDVI. In 2003, his firm received a $55 million grant from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Seattle, Washington, to support development and testing of dengue vaccines, including gauging the costs and impact of a vaccine. And many in the field say an economic incentive improves the outlook for a vaccine or treatment. \u201cI'd rather be working with a company that feels positive they're going to get some reward,\u201d Halstead says. A dengue vaccine could have a market in the hundreds of millions, says Margolis, who is working to ensure that the vaccine will be available to everyone who needs it \u2014 not just those who can pay for it. A two-tiered market \u2014 public and private \u2014 is likely to emerge, catering to governments on one hand and to travellers, the military and foreign-aid organizations on the other, says Margolis. \u201cYou can sell it to the private sector, but it may not make dengue go away,\u201d warns Margolis. \u201cIf that happens, that could severely affect the success of dengue vaccination.\u201d But a dengue vaccine is not a  fait accompli , and a number of challenges could slow or derail development. One of the most important is the vaccine's safety. A successful vaccine would need to provide immunity to all four strains of the virus. Inadequate protection against any one strain could boost chances of coming down with DHF. And with hundreds of millions of people vaccinated, any slight safety problem will be magnified, says Halstead. Although no one questions the need for a dengue vaccine, some wonder how far away it actually is. \u201cWe've been waiting for a vaccine for a very long time,\u201d says Michael Nathan, dengue specialist at the WHO. He emphasizes the importance of continued mosquito control, which can address not just dengue, but other mosquito-borne diseases, such as yellow fever and malaria (see  'Mosquito-borne diseases' ). In the meantime, Singapore and its increasingly wealthy neighbours may have to contend with more of Ng's generation falling to this indiscriminate killer. \n                     Climate takes aim \n                   \n                     Indonesia to tackle tuberculosis and dengue \n                   \n                     Disease outbreaks highlight India's poor mosquito control \n                   \n                     New lease of life for tropical medicine \n                   \n                     Dengue virus: Break-bone fever \n                   \n                     Dengue in Singapore \n                   \n                     Pediatric Dengue Vaccine Initiative \n                   \n                     Novartis Institute for Tropical Diseases \n                   \n                     World Health Organization dengue site \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Her death brings Indonesia's total number of fatalities from bird flu to 82, and hits its main tourist destination while it is still reeling from terrorist incidents.

Charles Grassley, the Republican senator for Iowa, has said that he will introduce legislation to set up a national public registry of payments made to doctors by pharmaceutical companies. Four states and the District of Columbia already have laws requiring such disclosures. But, Grassley says, such laws should be rolled out nationwide. \u201cFor the sake of transparency and accountability, shouldn't the American public know who their doctor [ sic ] is taking money from?\u201d Grassley asked in a speech on the Senate floor on 2 August. Grassley is not the first legislator to propose a registry, and his office did not provide details of his plan. Whatever the plan entails, it is likely to meet resistance from the American Medical Association and the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America. Public unease with lucrative arrangements between researchers and industry has grown in recent years, increasing demand for more information about these ties. Questions about drug safety have highlighted the issue of whether industry-sponsored research by academic scientists is trustworthy. And a 2003 scandal over conflicts of interest at the National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, embarrassed the agency and led to predictions that the practice would spill over to universities (see  Nature   431 , 725; 2004). Now, this seems to be occurring. In his speech, Grassley acknowledged that universities often require their researchers to disclose payments from outside sources, but said there are flaws with this system. For instance, it relies on the researcher to make accurate disclosures, which are not generally released to the public. Now, Grassley is asking universities for more information about how well the process works. Observers say a national registry should improve on the shortcomings of existing state registries. \u201cThe states deserve credit for being a source of innovation on this issue, but not one of them has produced complete or readily accessible disclosure,\u201d says Peter Lurie of the watchdog group Public Citizen, in Washington DC. An analysis of drug payment disclosures in Vermont and Minnesota has found serious loopholes and a lack of enforcement (J. S. Ross  et al .  J. Am. Med. Assoc.   297 , 1216\u20131223; 2007) . For instance, 61% of payments to Vermont physicians were not made public because the state's law allows companies to designate the information as a \u201ctrade secret\u201d. And only one-quarter of drug companies in Minnesota reported their payments, which did nothing to ensure compliance with the law, Lurie says. \n                     Universities fear repercussions as NIH tunes conflicts policy \n                   \n                     Time for a medical \n                   \n                     Weighing up the evidence \n                   \n                     JAMA article on state drug payment registries \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

The mesquite tree is perhaps best known for its ability to lend that smoky flavour to an old-fashioned southern barbecue. But Texan researchers are now hoping that it might also help to relieve the dependence of the United States on fossil fuels. Although useful as a barbecue fuel, mesquite trees are largely viewed as an invasive pest. Farmers and taxpayers already spend millions of dollars each year removing the trees from farmlands, where they steal space and resources from grazing grasses.  So using them as a raw material for biofuels such as ethanol could therefore kill two birds with one stone, suggests Jim Ansley of the Texas Agricultural Experiment Station in College Station, who is leading the project: adding incentive to remove the trees and creating energy from the waste. But removing the shrubby trees, which can reach 6 to 9 metres in height, is not as simple as it sounds. Farmers have tried using pesticides, controlled burning and even bulldozers. \"It's not easy to harvest, it's very gnarly,\" Ansley says. He and his colleagues are trying to develop ways to collect it as a harvested crop rather than on a tree-by-tree basis \u2014 and that will involve developing some kind of huge machine akin to a combine harvester for entire trees.  \n              Tree harvesting  \n            So far, Ansley and his team have spent $70,000 creating a mesquite 'vacuum cleaner' to scoop up branches and twigs after the trees have been mowed down by a conventional bulldozer. A rotor gathers up the woody material and shears off mesquite stumps, without harming the grass and valuable soil beneath. Designing a single machine to combine both felling and collection would cost about half a million dollars, Ansley told the annual meeting of the Ecological Society of America in San Jose, California, where he presented the project. Ansley suspects that, of the 52 million acres of Texas infested with mesquite, perhaps 20 million are dense enough to harvest economically using such machines. Other countries with vast tracts of ranch lands, such as Australia, might also be able to collect and use mesquite or similar trees in the same way.  The next step, says Ansley, is to calculate more precisely how mesquite harvesting would work. He envisages a network of small refineries taking 10-year-old mesquite wood from surrounding ranch lands within a radius of 30 kilometres, and redistributing the resulting ethanol to mix with gasoline for greener fuel. \"I've been amazed at the level of interest,\" he says. \"Every counsellor of the small rural towns in west Texas has been in touch. A lot of them think we've got the refinery there already though.\" That reality is, however, quite some way off.  \n              Burning future \n            There is a growing interest in generating ethanol fuel from the cellulose in plant material; fuel stocks such as trees and grasses are cheaper, more sustainable raw materials, and require little or no fertilizer or other farming techniques to grow. Switching to such fuel stocks would reduce the bioethanol sector's current reliance on corn grain as a raw material, which is criticized by many economists and ecologists as unsustainable. But there is as yet no commercial method to transform material from woody plants such as mesquite into biofuel economically. \"We need a technological breakthrough,\" Ansley admits.  But there are other ways of harvesting energy from the plants. Ansley forecasts that small communities could start to build 'bioheat' power stations using harvested mesquite, burning the wood to create green electricity on a small scale. \"Fifty to 100 years down the road I think it's a very attractive option,\" he says. \"It would be equivalent to having solar panels or a small windmill for a town.\" As for that unique barbecue taste, would it become a thing of the past? Ansley says the invasive pest species is a readily replenished resource, meaning more barbecues for a long while yet. \"I don't think we would ever have a problem with losing mesquite,\" he jokes. \n             Visit our  \n             \n                 newsblog \n               \n              to read and post comments about this story.  \n           Texas Agricultural Experiment Station \n                   Earth and environment news \n                 \n                   Ecology and evolution news \n                 \n                   Technology news \n                 \n                   Climate change in focus \n                 \n                   Ecological Society of America meeting blog \n                 \n                   Texas Agricultural Experiment Station \n                 \n                   Photo gallery \n                 Reprints and Permissions"},

US Senator Tom Coburn is single-handedly blocking the passage of a bill through the Senate that aims to protect people from genetic discrimination. Coburn (Republican, Oklahoma) is using a legislative tactic called a hold to block a Senate vote on the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA), which was passed in April by the House of Representatives on a vote of 420 to 3 (see  Nature   447 , 14\u201315; 2007). The bill would make it illegal for employers or insurers to use genetic information in hiring, firing, promotion or insurance-coverage decisions. President George W. Bush has promised to sign the bill into law should it reach his desk. \u201cI believe the bill, as drafted, contains unintended consequences,\u201d Coburn wrote in a 1 August letter to his constituents, who have since deluged his office with complaining letters, e-mails and phone calls. \u201cCongress has both the moral and legal responsibility to pay attention to details and get them right. I want to assure you that my hold on GINA is not because I oppose the bill's purpose, but because I am concerned about its lack of precision.\u201d Coburn, who has holds on 87 bills, voted for essentially the same bill when the Senate passed it unanimously in 2005. At that time, both the House and Senate were controlled by Republicans, but the House refused to bring the bill to a vote. With Democrats now in charge of both, the bill is just one senator away from becoming law. Coburn wants changes in the bill that would make it harder for victims to sue employers in some cases. He also says that the bill's definition of genetic tests isn't identical in the sections dealing with employers and insurers.

However the poor health of the thawed-out microbes has led their discoverers to cast doubt on a notion long cherished by some \u2014 that life on Earth arrived here on comets from outside our solar system. After thawing ice from the Mullins and Beacon valleys in Antarctica, Kay Bidle, a microbiologist at Rutgers University, New Jersey, and colleagues discovered life in water from even the oldest samples \u2014 estimated to be around eight million years old. Microorganisms have been found alive in very old ice from another Antarctic site before now, but they date back only about 300,000 years, says Bidle. \"By examining microbes in ice as old as eight million years, our study significantly extends our understanding over which microbes retain viability,\" he notes. However, while some bacteria taken from 100,000-year-old ice reproduced quite readily, cells from the oldest ice multiplied only very slowly and their DNA was badly damaged. Studies of isolated DNA from the samples showed that it had become increasingly fragmented as time went on.  By analysing samples of ice varying from 100,000 years to eight million years, Bidle and colleagues calculated a 'DNA half-life'; the length of DNA fragments in the ice halves every 1.1 million years. This fragmentation is consistent with the idea that the DNA is being damaged by cosmic rays. Bidle and his colleagues believe this half-life makes it highly unlikely that life on Earth was carried here on comets from outside our solar system. \"If you take the speed of a comet and take the distance it would need to travel it would take longer than eight million years to do that. In a comet the DNA would be completely deteriorated,\" says Bidle.  However not all experts are convinced this work proves life was not carried to Earth by comets from outside our solar system. \"I have to say I don't understand how that conclusion is drawn from the observation related to the Beacon Valley ice,\" says Richard Hoover, an astrobiologist at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama. Ice and rock could protect microbes deep inside comets from radiation, he says.  Bidle and his team also point out implications of their work on Earth in terms of increasing the amount of genetic diversity available at the end of ice ages. Ice sheets in the process of melting could provide a kind of \"gene popsicle\" for other microorganisms that could acquire the newly defrosted DNA and incorporate it into their genomes. \"Given the widespread influence of lateral gene transfer within microbial populations ... one can envision periods in Earth's history when large numbers of ancient genes became available as ice sheets melted,\" they write in the  Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 1 . In a parallel development, an international team of scientists has succeeded in cultivating microbes from eight-million-year-old samples of Antarctic permafrost from the same Beacon Valley location as Bidle's ice. David Gilichinsky, a geocryologist at the Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow, and his colleagues found diverse populations of the oldest microorganisms discovered in permafrost to date. And while Bidle thinks he has found life cannot have come to Earth from beyond our solar system, Gilichinsky and his colleagues offer some succour for those enthusiastic about extraterrestrial life closer to home. \"Such studies could help define the limit of dormancy of frozen life on Earth and in ancient permafrost on other planets and, potentially, provide a model for Martian ecosystems,\" they write in their paper in  Astrobiology 2 .  \n             Visit our  \n             \n                 newsblog \n               \n              to read and post comments about this story.  \n           Reprints and Permissions"},

Meredith Wadman looks at a US public-relations success that is driving research funds and expertise towards this childhood condition, and asks who is missing out. Toni Braxton, Matthew Broderick, Bill Cosby \u2014 perhaps not names you would associate with social or communication difficulties, and yet in one night, they helped raise $1.45 million at a fund-raiser for research into one of the least-understood disorders affecting children: autism. Star-studded events such as that fund-raiser at New York's swanky Lincoln Center in April are the latest front of a public-relations battle to raise money for research into childhood diseases. In the United States, it's a battle that autism seems to be winning. \u201cI was sitting in the nosebleed section and it was $1,500 a ticket up there,\u201d recalls neurologist Gary Goldstein, president of the Kennedy Krieger Institute in Baltimore and chair of the scientific advisory committee for Autism Speaks, the group that organized the event. Goldstein recalls a 2005 Hollywood fund-raising concert featuring Jerry Seinfeld and Paul Simon.\u201cEvery four months there's something like that, and that doesn't count all the golf classics,\u201d Goldstein says. In less than three years, autism has emerged from relative obscurity on the fund-raising circuit to become the disease  du jour . The 1,000 biggest US private foundations nearly doubled their autism-related giving to $2.7 million between 1998 and 2005, according to the New York-based Foundation Center. The Autism Society of America, the founding father of autism groups, has also seen its budget grow steadily to $20 million. More striking are the contributions of two newcomers: Autism Speaks alone raised more than $33 million in 2006, its first full year of operation, and it is well on target to meet its goal of $55 million in 2007. And the lower-profile Simons Foundation, which began funding autism research in 2003, has spent more than $40 million and plans to spend another $100 million over the next five years. The commonly held belief that the prevalence of autism is rising may be partly responsible for the cash flow. Previously reported as affecting fewer than 1 in 2,000 children, studies over the past five years have found a dramatically increased prevalence: 1 in 150 eight-year-olds in the United States, according to a February report by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta, Georgia; or 1 in 86 nine-to-ten-year-olds, according to research in one UK region (G. Baird  et al .  Lancet   368 , 210\u2013215; 2006 ). Experts attribute much of this rise to better diagnosis and reporting and to a broadened definition of autism that includes milder forms of the disease. The purported link to childhood vaccines (see  Nature Med.   13,  896\u2013897; 2007 ) \u2014 which has since been denounced by scientists \u2014 has also raised the public profile of the condition. But in the past two years, two people have had perhaps a greater impact on autism's visibility \u2014 and coffers \u2014 than any other single force, essentially rewriting the book on how to raise money for disease-specific research: Bob and Suzanne Wright, who founded Autism Speaks in 2005 after learning that their grandson had the poorly-understood condition. Bob Wright, then chairman and chief executive of media and entertainment conglomerate NBC Universal, provided his business savvy and his extensive connections to a Who's Who of American stardom. He also brought urgency. \u201cI know how devastating this problem is to families. I am reminded of it daily,\u201d says Wright. In 2004, Goldstein presented the Wrights with a graph contrasting charitable autism spending, then at about $14 million, with the $100-million-plus raised by disease groups for juvenile diabetes, muscular dystrophy, childhood cancer and cystic fibrosis \u2014 all of which are significantly less prevalent. \u201cTo move this field forward, we need that kind of money,\u201d Goldstein told them. Less than a year later, in February 2005, the Wrights launched Autism Speaks, which merged with the National Alliance for Autism Research and Cure Autism Now, in 2006 and 2007 respectively. Today, the organization has 141 employees and thousands of volunteers in 41 states. \u201cAt the rate the group is growing, I'd be shocked if five years from now it's not raising $100 million a year,\u201d observes Goldstein. Although there are other private groups focused on research and treatment, in the past the public's awareness of autism has not been as high as it could have been. \u201cWe were really out there by ourselves on awareness,\u201d says Wright. A public-relations coup changed that: last year, the group won a three-year campaign of free, slick publicity from the Advertising Council. The New York-based Simons Foundation is a very different player. Formed by Jim Simons, a mathematician and hedge-fund billionaire who has an autistic daughter, the organization is spending tens of millions funding individual researchers. It's also financing a $12-million collection of genetic information and cell lines from 2,000 affected families that will be made freely available to other scientists. The database is called the Simons Simplex collection, and is to be stored at Rutgers University, New Jersey. In 2006, Simons recruited Gerald Fischbach, the former director of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, as his scientific director. Taking the job, says Fischbach, was \u201ca chance to focus on just the very best science\u201d. \n               Terrific scientists \n             According to Fischbach, the swell of interest in the disease has been boosted by new genetic techniques and imaging tools. He notes that 11 of the 18 scientists to whom the foundation will soon make three-year grants of up to $3 million are new to the field. \u201cYou couldn't attract terrific scientists if there were no good ways to approach the disease,\u201d Fischbach says. The upward trend in money and interest has been mirrored at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), where funding for autism research has grown from $22 million in 1997 to $108 million this year \u2014 with 16% of that growth happening since 2003, while the rest of the NIH has been essentially flat-funded. At the CDC, which in 2000 spent just over $1 million on epidemiological research on autism, spending has soared to $15.1 million in 2007. Even the Department of Defense is getting in on the act, spending $7.5 million on autism research this year, largely thanks to Autism Speaks, which successfully lobbied Congress for the money on the grounds that autism in military families costs more than $200 million to treat annually. The most recent legislative achievement of the autism-research advocacy groups is the Combating Autism Act, which was passed in December 2006 after intense lobbying. It guarantees that the spotlight will stay on the disease, requiring for the first time that the government draw up an annual strategic plan for autism research, identifying gaps and opportunities, all with the input of affected families. \u201cThe advocacy groups here have had an enormous impact,\u201d says Tom Insel, the director of the National Institute of Mental Health, which with its $62-million spending in 2006 made the largest financial contribution of the five NIH institutes that fund autism research. Insel, who also chairs an inter-agency committee that coordinates autism research for the federal government, says of the advocates: \u201cThey hold our feet to the fire, and make sure we are relevant and accountable.\u201d But something distinguishes autism advocates, especially Autism Speaks. \u201cThey are actually raising very substantial amounts of funds to do a lot of the science themselves,\u201d adds Insel. \n               Bigger share \n             That fund-raising prowess has generated both admiration and envy from disease groups that could be considered competitors. For example, since the doubling of the NIH budget ended in 2003, NIH's cystic fibrosis funding has fallen from $117 million to $85 million; funding for childhood leukaemia from $70 million to $53 million; and funding for Down's syndrome, which is about one-fifth as prevalent as autism, from $23 million to $13 million. \u201cWhy is Down's syndrome funding low? Autism I think is a big contributor,\u201d says Jon Colman, the chief operating officer of the National Down Syndrome Society. \u201cIt's dominating priorities.\u201d Fischbach concedes that what's good for autism has to be bad for others that rely on NIH funding. As long as the biomedical agency's budget continues to be frozen year after year, he argues, pouring new NIH millions into autism necessarily means funding less research on some other diseases. \u201cThere is a dark side\u201d to the surge in autism funding, he admits. But other disease groups say that they have benefited from the rise in autism's profile \u2014 some by learning from Autism Speaks' example, and others because autism can coexist with other, lesser-known diseases such as tuberous sclerosis and fragile X syndrome, which causes mental retardation. \u201cPeople are beginning to talk about the probable genetic basis for most autism. And then often, if not always, they mention fragile X as an example,\u201d says Robert Miller, the executive director of the National Fragile X Foundation in Walnut Creek, California, who was pleased when a recent cover story on autism in  Newsweek  made a passing mention of fragile X. But despite its new visibility and funding, autism remains a little-understood and untreatable disease, and it is unclear how much this well-managed public-relations exercise will change that. Insel is optimistic, though. \u201cAutism has attracted the attention of the most stellar geneticists and neuroscientists,\u201d he points out. \u201cSo I'm hopeful.\u201d See Editorial,  \n                     page 623 \n                   . \n                     Biomedical philanthropy: State of the donation \n                   \n                     Biomedical philanthropy: The money tree \n                   \n                     Biomedical philanthropy: Love or money \n                   \n                     Biomedical philanthropy: The giving machine \n                   \n                     Health cheques \n                   \n                     The changing view of autism \n                   \n                     Autism Speaks \n                   \n                     The Simons Foundation \n                   \n                     Ad Council autism campaign \n                   \n                     Centers for Disease Control and Prevention February 2007 report on autism prevalence \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

It took 22 years and involved 64 chemical transformations, but chemists have finally succeeded in making a synthetic version of the natural insecticide azadirachtin. It is the longest-running project that Steven Ley's group, at the University of Cambridge, UK, has ever completed. But it is unlikely that this 'total synthesis' will ever be repeated \u2014 even though Ley is confident that he could more than halve the number of steps \u2014 because it is much easier to extract azadirachtin from the seeds of the Indian neem tree ( Azadirachta indica ). For some chemists, these sorts of  tours de force  seem increasingly irrelevant. Natural-product synthesis emerged in the 1820s when Friedrick W\u00f6hler synthesized urea, showing for the first time that a chemical made by nature could be recreated in the lab. It has spawned some serendipitous discoveries: William Perkin made the first synthetic dye, mauveine, in 1856 while trying to synthesize the drug quinine at the Royal College of Chemistry, now part of Imperial College London. But for the past 20 years there's been a growing consensus among chemists that the routes to some target molecules are so complicated and low-yielding that making them in this way is pointless. Synthetic azadirachtin is unlikely ever to be used. \u201cSixty-four steps is not going to be possible for anyone to make on any scale,\u201d says Gemma Veitch, who helped derive the synthesis. In fact, the trend now is to extract pesticides from their natural sources and to move away from either naturally based or purely synthetic compounds such as DDT (dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane), says John Pickett, head of biochemistry research at Rothamsted Research in the United Kingdom. But Ley insists that his quest was not in vain. \u201cWe won't quit now,\u201d he says. \u201cWe want to understand a lot more about the biology of the compound.\u201d He also expects to make simpler, more effective analogues of azadirachtin that lessen some of the sensitivity the compound shows towards light, acids and bases. Ley says he has also identified the protein in insects that binds to azadirachtin, and that without total synthesis, none of these things would have been possible. The full synthesis appears in the journal  Angewandte Chemie  (G. E. Veitch  et al .  Angew.Chem.  doi:10.1002/anie.200703027; 2007 ). Derek Lowe, a medicinal chemist and author of the blog 'In the pipeline', is a vocal critic of total synthesis. He says that the traditional justifications for the process, such as structure determination, have evaporated as characterization techniques including nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and mass spectrometry have advanced. He also dismisses the need to make complicated molecules, calling it a trophy-grabbing exercise. \u201cMaking the molecule just for the sake of being able to do it is a waste of time,\u201d he says. \u201cSome groups have lost track of the reason they're doing total synthesis.\u201d \u201cIn the past we were peacocks, we liked to show off,\u201d Ley admits. But his attitude has changed. \u201cToday it's all about the value of what you do.\u201d There is no point in going after \u201cEverest\u201d challenges, he says. \u201cI don't have to be first; the elegance of the approach is what interests me.\u201d Paul Wender, a synthetic chemist at Stanford University, suggests a different approach. Rather than attempting a very complex molecule, why not design simple but related target molecules, based on the structure and function of the complex natural product, he asks. \u201cThis addresses a major problem that many voice about complex molecule synthesis, namely that the targets, although exciting in function, are often too complex to be made in a practical fashion,\u201d Wender says. Other total-synthesis chemists vehemently defend their craft. Phil Baran, from the Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla, California, admits that total synthesis is not a fashionable pursuit but he insists that it will endure. \u201cAnybody who downplays the Ley achievement as anything other than a landmark is simply jealous.\u201d Baran is driven by what he describes as \u201cthe creation of beauty\u201d and says: \u201cIf you focus on generating complexity in new ways, you have the opportunity to open up new realms of chemical space.\u201d He cites examples of important reactions discovered in the course of solving a seemingly intractable synthesis, including a reaction called the Nozaki\u2013Hiyama\u2013Kishi coupling to form carbon\u2013carbon bonds. Lowe dismisses this idea. \u201cYou're more likely to find new chemistry if you're looking for it,\u201d he says. But he admits that Ley's work is different, because Ley invented new reagents and general synthetic routes to reach his goal. Ley himself is well aware of the debates surrounding total synthesis, which he attributes to a squeeze on funding, and says that those who criticize are those who are unwilling to do the tough chemistry themselves. \u201cThere is nothing more noble than what we're trying to achieve,\u201d he says. \n                     Marine natural products: Drugs from the deep \n                   \n                     Nature chemistry portal \n                   \n                     Nature reviews drug discovery \n                   \n                     The Ley group \n                   \n                     In the pipeline \n                   \n                     Totally synthetic \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

A shockwave could be about to hit the normally tranquil waters of social science. A German economist, specializing in environmental science and technology, has allegedly committed serial plagiarism and invented academic affiliations going back decades. The case should act as a warning sign to editors about how widespread plagiarism and deception may be, experts say. Events may only now be catching up with Hans Werner Gottinger, 63, who is drifting into retirement in the town of Ingolstadt, Germany. This week the journal  Research Policy  is set to retract a 1993 paper by Gottinger, which analysed demand for spin-off technologies from Ronald Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative. An accompanying editorial explains that two referees concluded that the article substantially plagiarized a paper published in 1980 in the  Journal of Business  by Frank Bass, then an economist at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana. The editorial also profiles other cases of plagiarism. Gottinger claims that he has \u201conly scant recollection\u201d of events so long in the past, but insists that he did not intend to plagiarize. He adds that he has \u201csincerely apologized\u201d for any misunderstandings. Problems with his paper came to the journal editors' attention in June, when a student noted that whole paragraphs and strings of complex mathematical equations in the Bass paper \u2014 which analysed demand for consumer-durable technologies \u2014 had been repeated almost exactly in Gottinger's paper. Gottinger did not acknowledge the Bass paper in his work. Further investigations by one of the journal editors, Ben Martin, an expert in science policy at the University of Sussex in Brighton, UK, revealed that this was not the first such case. In 1999, the editors of the economics journal  Kyklos  had withdrawn a 1996 paper by Gottinger after finding that it had plagiarized a 1992 paper in the journal  Economics of Innovation and New Technology . And by googling various strings of text from half a dozen other Gottinger papers, Martin identified yet another case \u2014 a 2002 paper by Gottinger about an economic model of global warming in the  International Journal of Global Energy Issues , in which whole sections were remarkably similar to a 1997 article in the  Journal of Environmental Economics and Management , by economist Zhiqi Chen of Carleton University in Ottawa, Canada. \u201cI was shocked and saddened that someone in my profession could do something like that,\u201d Chen says. For his part, Gottinger says that the papers were \u201cclearly designed as review papers and did not claim any novel ideas\u201d. Martin then contacted Gottinger's supposed employer, Maastricht University in the Netherlands, about the cases. But the university says that Gottinger has never been appointed or affiliated with it in any capacity. \u201cWe have written to Gottinger and asked him to remove from the web all reference to an affiliation with our university,\u201d says university spokeswoman Jeanine Hermans. Gottinger told  Nature  that the affiliation was a \u201cmisguided muddling\u201d of other institutes in Maastricht with which he claims to have been affiliated, and says he has contacted all the web pages he can think of to correct matters. Nature  has checked other claims made by Gottinger, including membership of professional societies and editorships of several influential journals. We failed to confirm membership of any of the societies, and some of the journals deny he was ever an editor with them. He was, however, removed from the advisory board of  Technology Forecasting and Social Change  in 2003, after the journal became aware of the issue of the  Kyklos  plagiarism. \n               A chequered career \n             Gottinger started out in 1973 as a faculty member at the University of Bielefeld in northern Germany, until his resignation in 1980. His contemporary Peter Weingart remembers him as someone strongly orientated towards mathematical approaches, which was unusual in a sociology department. \u201cHe was considered highly intelligent but reserved,\u201d Weingart says. In 1979, Gottinger was sacked from the GSF national research centre in Munich because of deception relating to a European Union grant application. From the mid-1980s on, he started to list Maastricht University as his academic affiliation on papers. In 1988 he was appointed as director of the Fraunhofer Institute for Technological Trend Analysis in Euskirchen near Bonn. He says he left over professional differences of opinion; current director Uwe Wiemken says the appointment \u201cdidn't end peacefully\u201d. Gottinger then moved abroad, working at the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies in the United Kingdom, and also at Norway's Centre for International Climate and Environmental Research in Oslo. In the mid-1990s he was involved with a private business school in the small town of Bad Waldsee in southwest Germany. Over the past decade, Gottinger has held various positions in Japan as well as an appointment at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, New York, that lasted only a matter of weeks. At one point he received a special fellowship from the Carisal Foundation in Salerno, Italy, on the strength of the impressive CV he submitted. During his career, Gottinger has clocked up more than 100 articles in reputable journals, and was shortlisted for the rectorship of the University of Klagenfurt in Austria in 1995, coming within a whisker of being elected. Institutions that employed him are reluctant to discuss details of his case.  Nature  has investigated other affiliations claimed by Gottinger at different times and found many to be inaccurate \u2014 including Osaka University in Japan, which Gottinger attributes to a \u201csloppy misrepresentation\u201d of claimed affiliations with two other institutes in the city. So how could he have got away with so much alleged deception for so long? Detecting plagiarism is not easy (see  'Copycat trap' ). Martin also speculates that the highly mathematical nature of Gottinger's work, unusual in the social sciences, may have been tough on referees. \u201cIt's frightening \u2014 it suggests plagiarism may be much more common than we previously thought,\u201d says Martin. \u201cIt undermines the basis of trust we have \u2014 and must continue to have \u2014 in our academic literature and our research community.\u201d Most scientists who had contact with Gottinger refer to him as a lone operator \u2014 only occasionally did he have a co-author. One of these was Peter Weimann, now a professor at the University of Applied Sciences in Berlin. (None of his co-authored papers is suspected of having plagiarized work.) Weimann says that Gottinger was \u201chard to work with because he was not very communicative\u201d. In a final twist, Martin has found that one of Gottinger's papers (in 1992) may itself have been plagiarized \u2014 in 2005, by an academic from Zimbabwe. \n                 Alison Abbott, with additional reporting by David Cyranoski, Emiliano Feresin and Carina Lenotti \n               \n                     Preprint analysis quantifies scientific plagiarism \n                   \n                     Should journals police scientific fraud? \n                   \n                     Clamp down on copycats \n                   \n                     Special Report: Taking on the cheats \n                   \n                     Policing integrity \n                   \n                     CrossRef \n                   \n                     iParadigms \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Female mice missing a gene involved in pheromone detection show the same sexual behaviour as males, researchers report this week (T. Kimchi  et al .  Nature  doi:10.1038/nature06089; 2007 ). The striking finding, by Catherine Dulac's group at Harvard University implies that female mice have a 'male behaviour' circuit in their brains, which can be activated by the flick of a single genetic switch. Female mice genetically engineered to lack a gene called  Trpc2  engaged in exclusively male traits, such as pelvic thrusting, male calls and mounting other mice, both female and male. The TRPC2 protein is essential for the functioning of the vomeronasal organ \u2014 a part of the mouse nose that is involved in sensing pheromones. The results prompt a rethink about how the brain regulates sexual behaviour according to gender, but some query whether they could simply be an effect of the lab environment, or of the types of mice used. Lab conditions, says Dulac, might cause mice to be more limited in their behaviour than they otherwise would be. So, her group tested the same mutant mice under more natural conditions, leaving them in a larger enclosure for a month. The  Trpc2 -knockout mice still behaved sexually as if they were males. The genetic make-up of lab mice might also affect the results. There are three types of mouse, says geneticist Fernando Pardo-Manuel de Villena, of the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill. There are the classical lab mice, descended from one original pool of pets, bred to be less aggressive than average; wild-derived lab strains, which are not bred on the basis of behaviour; and wild mice. Wild and lab mice are effectively chalk and cheese, with \u201cstrikingly different behaviour\u201d, says Pardo-Manuel de Villena. Dulac's group bred two of the most common classical lab mouse strains \u2014 the C57BL and the 129/Sv types \u2014 together, and used the offspring in their experiments. But wild mice may behave very differently, points out mouse geneticist Elissa Chesler, of Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee. \u201cWould there be any compensation for this gene if this mutant was crossed to wild mice?\u201d Dulac's group is aware of this problem and is now breeding wild mice with the  Trpc2 -mutant mice, to experiment with a 'wilder' version. \n                 See News & Views, doi:10.1038/ \n                 \n                     nature05892 \n                   \n               \n                     The mouse map gets a lot more signposts \n                   \n                     Male mice signal sex with tears \n                   \n                     Brain development: The most important sexual organ \n                   \n                     Mouse and man agree to disagree \n                   \n                     Mice make medical history \n                   \n                     Mouse genome special \n                   \n                     Catherine Dulac's group \n                   \n                     Elissa Chesler's homepage \n                   \n                     Fernando Pardo-Manuel's homepage \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Scientists in Brazil are considering strike action or \u201ccivil disobedience of another form\u201d in protest over the imprisonment of a renowned primatologist. The case, they say, is a visible part of a wider government crackdown on scientists working in tropical areas around the world. Dutch-born maverick Marc van Roosmalen has spent more than 20 years living and working in the Amazon, where he has discovered various new species of mammal, including several primates. A Brazilian national since 1997, much of his research career has been spent in a quest to save the rainforest, occasionally bending the rules to achieve this end. But in 2002, van Roosmalen was charged with taking four monkeys from the forest northwest of Manaus without permits. The charges led to a federal congressional inquiry, a criminal case and, in June this year, a prison sentence of 15 years and 9 months. Van Roosmalen was convicted of keeping monkeys in a rehabilitation facility at his Manaus home without permits; auctioning names of new primate species to wealthy donors; and selling materials that had been donated to his former employer, the National Institute for Amazonian Research (INPA) in Manaus. The sentence has other researchers in Brazil worried. \u201cMy main concern is the precedent,\u201d says ecologist Regina Luiz\u00e3o of INPA in Manaus. \u201cIf this is happening to him now, how can we tell that we are not next?\u201d Ostensibly, the restrictions imposed on scientists are to limit biopiracy, whereby people profit from selling or patenting the properties of indigenous biomaterial without compensating the communities that they come from. The Brazilian authorities say the country has a serious problem with biopiracy and cannot afford to deal lightly with violations such as those committed by van Roosmalen. Vanessa Grazziotin, federal deputy for the State of Amazonas, who led the inquiry into van Roosmalen's case, is reported as saying at the time: \u201cThere is a vast biopiracy network infiltrating the research institutes.\u201d (Grazziotin was unavailable for comment when approached by  Nature .) But researchers say the authorities are going too far and limiting the nation's scientific potential. As a result, says INPA ecologist Philip Fearnside, Brazil and other nations will lose out. \u201cBrazil has lost all kinds of money and intellectual importance because of its attempts to protect biodiversity from international interference,\u201d he says. In July, 287 researchers from 31 countries attending the annual meeting of the Association for Tropical Biology and Conservation in Morelia, Mexico, signed a petition protesting that van Roosmalen's sentencing was \u201cout of proportion with his alleged crimes\u201d and is \u201cindicative of governmental restrictions on scientists\u201d in Brazil. And, on 2 August, a group of top researchers organized by the Brazilian Society for the Advancement of Science (SBPC) met to discuss its strategy in response to the Roosmalen case and the larger issues it represents in relation to scientists' ability to work in Brazil. The group will meet again this week, says Leandro Salles of the National Museum in Rio de Janeiro. \u201cVan Roosmalen is a specific case, within a broader context that is very sad for the country,\u201d Salles says. \u201cUnder the current laws, researchers are treated as potential criminals.\u201d Salles adds that researchers are fed up with increasing restrictions on their activities, including the jailing of scientists for minor infractions of permit laws, tougher biopiracy regulations that came into effect in 2001, and new rules that give the Brazilian military the authority to reject research project applications with foreign collaborators. Salles says the SBPC working group has been trying for several years to convince the government to change aspects of the laws with little success, and sees the van Roosmalen case as a last straw. \u201cOne more letter of complaint, one more meeting in Brasilia isn't going to change anything,\u201d Salles says. \u201cSo there is now a group that is ready to propose more forceful political acts, which could include strikes or civil disobedience of another form.\u201d Scientists outside Brazil say they are also facing increasing difficulty when working in the tropics, where governments are cracking down on research in the name of combating biopiracy. In 2006, for instance, the Gandhi Agricultural University in Raipur, India, charged a former professor with illegally giving plants to a UK-based company. \n                     Biodiversity: Cashing in on the rich coast \n                   \n                     Stiffer rules required to stop commerce milking Antarctica \n                   \n                     Natural resources: Bioprospects less than golden \n                   \n                     Marc van Roosmalen's website \n                   \n                     Help Marc van Roosmalen website \n                   \n                     Convention on Biological Diversity \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

The US Department of Energy is starting construction of a controversial facility to recycle nuclear warheads. On 1 August, work finally began on a US$4.8 billion mixed-oxide fuel-fabrication facility at the Savannah River Site in South Carolina. The plant will convert surplus, weapons-grade plutonium into fuel for sale to commercial power reactors in North and South Carolina. Supporters claim that the facility will help to dispose of dangerous weapons material safely. But sceptics, including some key members of Congress, balk at its enormous cost and question whether it will improve the nation's nuclear security. Since the 1990s, the department has touted mixed-oxide fuel as the best way to dispose of 34 tonnes of highly enriched plutonium sitting in the US stockpile, to fulfil its disarmament agreement with Russia. The technique blends plutonium with uranium so that it can be burned in conventional light-water reactors. Dozens of European reactors run on mixed-oxide fuel made from old commercial fuel, according to Matthew Bunn, a non-proliferation expert at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The US plant design is actually a smaller version of the commercial French Melox reprocessing facility at Marcoule. Engineers have modified the design slightly to handle weaponized plutonium alloys, and they have reduced shielding because weapons-grade isotopes are less radioactive than spent commercial fuel. The programme gained political momentum in part because Russia was planning to build a sister facility to convert an equal amount of its own plutonium surplus, according to Daryl Kimball, executive director of the Arms Control Association in Washington DC. But the Russians have backed away from the plan in recent years, Kimball says. The US plant has also been beset by policy reviews, a lengthy licensing process and congressional opposition. It is now more than a decade behind schedule, and construction costs have ballooned by nearly 400% since 2002. Nevertheless, department officials stand by the programme. In addition to fulfilling their disarmament obligations, the plan will be cheaper than long-term storage, Secretary of Energy Samuel Bodman told Congress. Bunn disagrees, in part because the department will be storing other plutonium anyway. \u201cThe cost of having a few extra bunkers is actually very modest,\u201d he says. Which side Congress will take remains to be seen. The Senate is proposing roughly $390 million for construction in fiscal year 2008, but House appropriators want to give it just $168 million.

Marine scientists are voicing concerns that their research may be jeopardized by the international scrum to claim the Arctic seabed. Last week, Russia highlighted its claims to a vast chunk by sending a mission to drop a titanium capsule with a Russian flag on the seabed underneath the North Pole. Canada, Norway, the United States and Denmark (on behalf of Greenland) are also preparing claims. The 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) allows states an economic zone that extends 200 nautical miles from their coastline. To increase this, countries must prove to the United Nations Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf that their physical continental margin extends farther than this. If Moscow can prove that the structure of the continental shelf under the ocean is geologically similar to that of Russian land, it may be able to extend its territory. The Lomonosov Ridge, which it sees as a continental extension, is key to its claims. Russia hopes to claim 1.2 million square kilometres and, with it, the rights to copious mineral and fossil-fuel reserves. Estimates vary, but some suggest that the Arctic contains as much as 25% of the world's oil reserves. A successful claim would not allow nations to control water above the seabed, but anyone doing research on the ocean floor would need permission, which worries some involved in geological and polar research. \u201cAccess is already a problem,\u201d says Mead Treadwell, chair of the US Arctic Research Commission. \u201cWe've looked at maps which show there could be very little free space left in the Arctic Ocean.\u201d Anders Karlqvist, director of the Swedish Polar Research Secretariat, agrees. \u201cIt will probably mean research will be more regulated in terms of getting permission and documentation that goes through various organizations in the countries concerned. And if the political climate changes it may lead to research restrictions.\u201d But the contest is providing plenty of work for some marine geologists in the run-up to many countries' deadline for submissions of May 2009. \u201cI've never worked so hard on strategic policy as now,\u201d says Lindsay Parson, who leads the UNCLOS Group at the United Kingdom's National Oceanography Centre in Southampton. To prove their claims, countries need to collect bathymetric data that accurately describe the underwater lie of the land and seismic data on the structure of the sea floor. These data can be used to determine where the continental shelf off a country's coast falls away in a 'continental slope' and how far sediments derived from the land extend out beyond the foot of that slope. The sea floor can be claimed if it is sedimentary rock at least 1% as thick as its distance from the foot of the continental slope. These measurements require input from geologists and oceanographic experts. If there is no sedimentary rock, a country is only entitled to claim an additional 60 nautical miles out. Satellite sensing is useless for imaging the seabed because of the overlying water, and Arctic research is further complicated by sea ice. Even when data can be gleaned by research ships, interpretation is tricky. \u201cIn many circumstances around the world when the ocean basins form and these ridges get stranded out in the middle of the ocean, it's not easy to say whether there's a greater attachment at one end of the ridge or the other,\u201d notes Parson. In 2001, Russia became the first country to make a submission to the United Nations. It was told to supply more information, in particular about the Lomonosov Ridge, which runs under the Arctic Ocean between Russia and Canada. Russia claims this ridge is an extension of its Siberian shelf, but this is hotly contested by Canada and others. On 29 July, Russia sent two mini-submarines, Mir-1 and Mir-2 to a depth of 1.3 kilometres in the first-ever Arctic test dives to gather data to boost its claims. The subs are part of an expedition to the North Pole involving a 100-strong team of Russian scientists aboard the  Academician Fedorov , the flagship vessel of the Federal Service for Hydrometeorology and Environment Monitoring. Meanwhile, Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper has announced plans to spend around Can$7 billion (US$6.5 billion) on up to eight new reinforced Arctic patrol vessels. \u201cCanada has a choice when it comes to defending our sovereignty in the Arctic; either we use it or we lose it,\u201d Harper said. \u201cAnd make no mistake, this government intends to use it. Because Canada's Arctic is central to our identity as a northern nation. It is part of our history and it represents the tremendous potential of our future.\u201d Canada is claiming 1.75 million square kilometres of the Arctic seabed.

But the scheme is faltering at the pilot stage due to political infighting, says Jane Qiu. Beijing has stifled an official report that measures the economic cost during 2005 of China's pollution and environmental damage \u2014 its 'green' gross domestic product (GDP) \u2014 claiming the methods and data available to make such a calculation are too crude for the findings to be meaningful. Critics fear that this may have sent out a dangerous signal for local authorities to continue pursuing economic growth at all costs. Originally scheduled for release in March, the \u201cindefinite postponement\u201d announced last week of the second report of the pilot scheme follows fierce dispute between China's environmental watchdog, the State Environmental Protection Administration (SEPA) and the National Bureau of Statistics of China (NBS). At a press conference on 12 July, Xie Fuzhan, director of NBS, openly attacked the scheme, questioning its feasibility and methodology. Because of these uncertainties, it should be submitted to the State Council (the country's chief administrative authority) for reference, rather than released to the public, he told journalists. Wang Jinnan of the Chinese Academy of Environmental Planning (part of SEPA), who leads the team calculating green GDP, held a press conference at which he defended the project and announced that the report would not be released anytime soon owing to disagreement between the two administrations. He also blamed the report's suppression on resistance from some local authorities, which he said had been lobbying the central government against it in their eagerness to maintain economic growth. It is no secret that SEPA and NBS have been arguing over the new accounting scheme since its launch in 2004, but many fear that their increasingly public turf war undermines SEPA and may lead to the accounting system being abandoned altogether. Although China has stated its commitment to environmental protection since 1983, passing more than 100 environmental laws, economic development traditionally takes priority and local officials in China are still judged largely on their ability to improve economic growth. The pilot scheme \u2014 which subtracts the cost of natural resources used and pollution caused from regular GDP \u2014 aimed to mitigate some of these excesses and help guide new development. In September 2006, the central government released its first green GDP report with much fanfare. Internationally, it was greeted as a significant step forward by China in tackling its environmental problems. The report found that pollution cost China 511.8 billion yuan (US$62 billion at 2004's official exchange rate, which underestimates the true economic value of the yuan), accounting for 3% of GDP for 2004. The environmental cost of water pollution, air pollution, and solid waste and pollution accidents accounted for 55.9%, 42.9% and 1.2% of the total costs, respectively. (See  box ) The scheme does have critics \u2014 for example, it does not account for groundwater or soil contamination. \u201cOn the whole, this accounting system gives a conservative estimation of China's environmental problems,\u201d says Lei Ming, an environmental economist at the Guanghua School of Management, Peking University, who helped compile the report. Admitting that the method of calculating green GDP needs to be improved, Lei says: \u201cOne must take a realistic and pragmatic approach towards the system. We can't get everything right at once and things will improve over time.\u201d He thinks that publicising the data could help curb environmental damage. \u201cThe stakes are high and we don't have a better alternative at the moment,\u201d he says. Yang Xin, president of Green River, a Chinese non-governmental organization, agrees. He is \u201cbitterly disappointed\u201d at the report's suppression, saying: \u201cAn unprecedented environmental crisis is unfolding in China. We can't afford to wait for a perfect accounting system to emerge while watching local governments destroying our environment.\u201d However, some environmental groups are sceptical of the scheme. \u201cIt is premature to implement such a system due to lack of an established formula to follow,\u201d says Zhang Jianyu, programme manager at the Beijing office of the Environmental Defense, a US non-profit environmental advocacy group. \u201cThere are other ways of measuring environmental impact.\u201d \n               Technical hurdles \n             Undoubtedly, there are technical hurdles in setting up a method of calculating green GDP. The United Nations, which has been working on a similar system for integrating environmental and economic accounting since the early 1990s, is still debating with economists, environmentalists and policy makers on how it should be done. According to Karl Schorer, head of the environmental-economic accounting department at the Federal Statistical Office of Germany, the main obstacle of such systems is the difficulty in calculating the market value of environmental impact \u2014 be it the extinction of a species, the cost of soil erosion due to deforestation, or the health damage from pollution. In some developed countries such as Germany, the current practice is to associate specific environmental damage \u2014 for example, carbon dioxide emissions \u2014 with the economic activities that cause it, and to have polices in place to regulate the industries involved. Alternatively, one can set a environmental target, for example, cutting emissions, and then calculate the estimated cost to reach that target. \u201cIt is very challenging to take everything into consideration and come out with a single figure,\u201d says Schorer. However, some critics claim that scientific difficulties are beside the point, the NBS is succumbing to pressure from local authorities. \u201cThe methodological issue is just a pretext,\u201d says a Beijing-based environment writer who asked not to be named. Sources close to SEPA told  Nature  that the scheme has met with fierce resistance from some local governments and that these are largely responsible for the difficulties it is facing. \u201cGreen GDP is a highly sensitive topic at the local level,\u201d says Lei. Some officials \u201cturn pale at the mention of green.\u201d The report's suspension \u201cshows that the scheme has touched a nerve,\u201d he adds. Jennifer Turner, coordinator of the Washington-based China Environment Forum, which acts as a clearing house for information on energy and environment issues in China, says the refusal by local governments to participate in the green GDP programme shows they are afraid of more information escaping. \u201cThe squirming of the local governments means [the green GDP plan] is working. They're running scared. Their feet are being put to the fire.\u201d The second report ranks all 31 provinces, autonomic regions and municipalities according to their green GDP. Some areas, especially those in the central and western part of the country, are relatively high on the GDP list, but their rankings fall significantly when environmental costs are factored in, says a SEPA source. An article published in the  Economic Observer , a Chinese newspaper, claims that the second report shows that there was an increase in the proportion of economic loss due to environmental pollution as relative to GDP in 2005 compared with the previous year. Lei declined to confirm the report, but says that \u201cyou don't need the numbers to tell that the environmental problems in China are worsening\u201d. Indeed, they are painfully visible: Beijing, which is set to host the 2008 Olympics, has reported its worst June air polution in seven years. Meanwhile, this year has seen repeated outbreaks of blue-green algae in the country's lakes and waterways \u2014 so much so that 2007 has been named China's year of algae. According to an article in the  Financial Times  this month, China asked the World Bank not to publish \u201csensitive\u201d estimates of the number of premature Chinese deaths each year from polluted air and water, calculated to be around 460,000, with a further 300,000 who died from indoor toxins. The 'green' price of development can be scarily high. In the northern province of Shanxi, a coal production centre, environmental costs and natural-resource losses constituted a third of its GDP in 2002. \u201cOf course, local officials don't want to see that on paper,\u201d says the SEPA source. The timing is a crucial factor, too. The Chinese Communist Party will hold its 17th five-yearly party congress this autumn, which will involve a lot of reshuffling, and officials would not like to have green GDP pose a stumbling block to their promotion. A final decision on the fate of the green GDP accounting system will be made by the State Council, and all parties involved are holding their breath. As a small ministerial authority, SEPA has long suffered from lack of resource and actual power. Although authorized to regulate the country's environment, it's often an uphill struggle for the agency to exert its influence among local governments and the business of entities on a par with itself. If the green GDP scheme were brought to a close, SEPA would have a tougher time ahead. \n                     Three Gorges dam set in stone \n                   \n                     A case for conservation \n                   \n                     China: Views from the West \n                   \n                     China's State Environmental Protection Administration \n                   \n                     China's National Bureau of Statistics \n                   \n                     Lei Ming at Peking University \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

That researchers' staple, the laboratory mouse, has undergone the ultimate dissection: two competing teams have completed the most thorough maps yet of its genetic variation. The catalogue of 8.27 million genetic differences provides a unique insight into the evolutionary origins of the mouse, and researchers also anticipate that it will speed up the discovery of disease-causing mutations in mice \u2014 and ultimately in humans. Although the two groups disagree over the evolutionary history of the lab mouse ( Mus musculus ), they both assert that the maps will give researchers fast access to an unparallelled cache of genetic information on hundreds of lab strains. \u201cIt's a whole new era of mouse genetics,\u201d says Gary Churchill, a mouse geneticist at Jackson Laboratory in Bar Harbor, Maine, and an author on one of the studies (H. Yang, T. A. Bell, G. A. Churchill & P.-M. de Villena  Nature Genet.  doi:10.1038/ng2087; 2007). The researchers traced the lineage of small chunks of the mouse genome in 11 common lab strains back to four wild subspecies. Because of the genetic similarity between the 450-odd inbred classical lab strains, a relatively small number of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), which are one-base-pair differences between two strains, can now be used to deduce the sequences of more than 8 million SNPs using the new map. If one segment of the genome can be attributed to a single ancestor, then all mouse strains that share that segment should have the same SNPs. As few as 50,000 SNPs spread across the genome per strain are needed to deduce the rest of the 8 million. \u201cYou don't have to go and resequence [their genomes],\u201d says Richard Mott, a bioinformatician at the Wellcome Trust Centre for Human Genetics in Oxford, UK, who was not involved in the studies. \u201cThat's tremendous.\u201d Mus musculus  is the most important model organism for human disease and the standard-bearer in cancer and immunology research, as 99% of mouse genes have a human counterpart. In the early 1900s, Abbie Lathrop, a former schoolteacher in Massachusetts, started breeding mice obtained from fanciers in Europe and Asia. These animals spawned the first lab, which were made genetically pure through dozens of generations of sibling mating. \u201cIt was really, truly just a handful of mice,\u201d says Kelly Frazer, a geneticist who led the second mapping effort while at the biotechnology company Perlegen Sciences in Mountain View, California (K. A. Frazer  et al .  Nature , doi:10.1038/nature06067 ; 2007 ). Subtle differences between strains \u2014 A/J mice are prone to cancer and BALB/cJ mice are susceptible to the bacterium  Listeria , for example \u2014 can be traced to SNPs, of which fewer than 45 million are thought to exist in lab and wild strains together. \n               Difference matters \n             The first mouse genome to be sequenced was that of C57BL/6J, in 2002. The US National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences in Triangle Park, North Carolina, teamed up with Perlegen to roughly sequence 10 more strains, plus four subspecies of wild mice collected from all over the world. The sequences were completed in 2006 and made freely available. To tease out more detail and to make the information applicable to other mouse strains, Frazer's team made a genomic map of each sequenced strain, and established the ancestral subspecies that gave rise to around 40,000 segments of the genome. Overall, says Frazer, a subspecies from Europe called  domesticus  contributes most (68%) of the lab mouse genome, but this varies from chromosome to chromosome and strain to strain. Frazer's team didn't know that Churchill's team was doing the same thing. \u201cIt would have been nice if the two groups had talked with one another,\u201d she says, \u201cbut they didn't let us know they were doing it.\u201d Using a slightly different method, Churchill and his colleagues at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill also conclude that  domesticus  provides the lion's share of diversity in lab mice, more than 90%. He says that the mouse genome is far more complex than he had thought. \u201cThis has been an unfolding story,\u201d he says. \u201cWe saw patterns that were so confusing.\u201d What has emerged is only a partial sketch, he says. Sequencing the entire genomes of more laboratory and wild strains will paint a fuller picture and settle the differences between the two maps. \u201cIt's going to be resolved,\u201d Churchill says. Although the teams present two evolutionary histories for the lab mouse, \u201cthe similarities are more important than the differences,\u201d Mott says. And the ability to deduce polymorphisms in other strains doesn't depend on an unambiguous history. Researchers will be eager to make use of the data, say both teams. Mark Daly at the Broad Institute in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and a co-author with Frazer, has already applied the map to 100 strains of mice that had been genotyped for 150,000 SNPs, and will soon be able to assign millions more SNPs to these mice. The projects could also spur the use of less common lab strains by providing better genetic maps, says Elizabeth Fisher, a geneticist at University College London. \u201cThere's an enormous amount of diversity out there that we're not capitalizing on,\u201d she says. A collaboration of hundreds of researchers called the Complex Trait Consortium plans to breed 1,000 new mouse strains (see  'Mice unlimited' ). And now those strains will be easily genotyped. \u201cIt's going to allow us to make better mouse lines for the future, with levels of diversity that are more like human diversity,\u201d Churchill says. \n                     Geneticists hail variety show \n                   \n                     Mice make medical history \n                   \n                     Mouse sequencing plan aims to boost models \n                   \n                     Mouse genome special \n                   \n                     Complex trait consortium \n                   \n                     Jackson laboratory \n                   \n                     Broad Institute mouse site \n                   \n                     Perlegen mouse site \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Tiny channels provide corridors of communication between adult stem cells and their differentiated neighbours, a study has found. The finding could be an important step towards determining how to control the development of adult stem-cell identity, but there's a catch \u2014 it was discovered in the planarian flatworm  Schmidtea mediterranea . The flatworms, best known for their regenerative prowess and cross-eyed charm, maintain a supply of stem cells to regrow tissue lost to anything from daily wear-and-tear to full decapitation. And, although it seems a long way to travel along the evolutionary tree, there are reasons to think planarians make a good model for human stem cells, says regeneration biologist and planarian researcher Alejandro S\u00e1nchez Alvarado at the University of Utah School of Medicine in Salt Lake City. He belives that the basic principles uncovered in planarians will translate to human cells, although the finer details may differ. Even biologists who don't study the worms agree. \u201cWork in planarians and other lower organisms always gives us hints regarding human stem cells,\u201d says Shinya Yamanaka, a stem-cell researcher at Kyoto University in Japan. Biologists N\u00e9stor Oviedo and Michael Levin of the Forsyth Institute in Boston, Massachusetts, studied channels known as gap junctions that permit the passage of small molecules and ions between cells. When  S. mediterranea  was manipulated so that it did not express a key gap-junction protein, thus preventing communication between cells, it lost its regenerative capabilities and its reservoir of stem cells (N. J. Oviedo and M. Levin  Development   134,  3121\u20133131; 2007). This fits with the findings of studies in human embryonic stem cells, says Alice P\u00e9bay, a biologist at the University of Melbourne, Australia. Previous work has shown that chemically induced closure of gap junctions can slow human embryonic stem-cell growth. But, notes P\u00e9bay, Ovideo and Levin were able to use a technique to reduce expression of the gap-junction proteins \u2014 something that would be very difficult to do in human embryonic stem cells. Nevertheless, technical challenges to planarian research remain. For example, reducing expression of an  S. mediterranea  gene is straightforward, but techniques for over-expressing planarian genes are still rudimentary, says Levin. \n                     Electric switch could turn on limb regeneration \n                   \n                     Mice regrow damaged spinal cord \n                   \n                     Drug may give cells a fresh start \n                   \n                     The regeneration gap \n                   \n                     Legless and ready for a fight \n                   \n                     Stem Cells In Focus \n                   \n                     Nature Reports Stem Cells  blog The Niche \n                   \n                     \n                         Nature Reports Stem Cells \n                       \n                   \n                     Michael Levin Lab \n                   \n                     Alejandro S\u00e1nchez Alvarado lab \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Brain function has been improved in a patient who was in a minimally conscious state, by electrically stimulating a specific brain region with implanted electrodes. The achievement raises questions about the treatment of other patients who have been in this condition for years, the researchers say. Patients in a minimally conscious state, often the result of severe brain trauma, show only intermittent evidence of awareness of the world around them. Typically, they are assumed to have little chance of further recovery if they show no improvement during their initial 12-month rehabilitation programme. In the latest case study, neuroscientists describe how they implanted electrodes in the brain of a 38-year-old man who had been in a minimally conscious state for more than six years following a serious assault. By electrically stimulating a brain region called the central thalamus, they were able to help him name objects on request, make precise hand gestures, and chew food without the aid of a feeding tube (see  page 600 ). The thalamus is involved in motor control, arousal and in relaying sensory signals \u2014 from the visual systems, for example \u2014 to the cerebral cortex, the part of the brain involved in consciousness. Nicholas Schiff of Weill Cornell Medical College in New York, and his colleagues chose the patient because they believed his condititon was due to impairment of the arousal system, and that despite considerable damage to his cerebral cortex, many essential areas were preserved. \u201cThere will be a subset of patients who are responsive to this approach,\u201d says Schiff. But he adds that patients with different brain injuries may not benefit from electrostimulation. \u201cNot every patient in a minimally conscious state will fit this profile,\u201d Schiff says, and it is difficult for neurologists to identify those patients who will show recovery. Nevertheless, the case shows that many patients currently seen as beyond hope of rehabilitation might benefit from the results of further research. \u201cSevere brain injury is not an uncommon problem, and the number of people doing research on this is shockingly small,\u201d Schiff says. \u201cIt's very rare to find a programme that will take a patient in a minimally conscious state even straight out of acute care. If they don't respond in a lively enough way and can't communicate and interact with people at the bedside, they go to a nursing home directly.\u201d \u201cThe report does not suggest that deep-brain stimulation [DBS] 'cures' the minimally conscious state,\u201d says Paul Matthews, a clinical neuroscientist at Imperial College, London. \u201cAlthough based on a study of only a single patient, it suggests that DBS may be adapted to benefit at least some patients in the minimally conscious state. And it emphasizes that improvements can be made by patients even long after an injury. \u201cAlthough we do not know precisely which brain connections are important, we may expect that some specific connections must be intact for DBS to have a beneficial effect.\u201d See also News & Views,  \n                     page 539 \n                   . \n                     'Vegetative' patient shows signs of conscious thought \n                   \n                     Flickers of consciousness \n                   \n                     'Miracle recovery' shows brain's resilience \n                   \n                     Right-to-die case highlights brain mysteries \n                   \n                     Neuroscience: Deep in thought \n                   \n                     Brain and behaviour news \n                   \n                     Health and medicine news \n                   \n                     Technology news \n                   \n                     Weill Cornell Medical College Neurology and Neuroscience \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

On 29 August, J\u00fcrgen Graeser of the Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research in Potsdam, Germany, will embark on an eight-month Russian-led voyage on a d rifting ice floe to the North Pole. The German will join 35 Russian colleagues from the Arctic and Antarctic Research Institute in St Petersburg, Russia, to collect a wealth of atmospheric and sea-ice data in one of the most remote and inhospitable regions of the planet.  Quirin Schiermeier  spoke to the first Westerner invited to spend time on a Russian drifting station. \n               Why is this expedition special? \n             There'll be no ship, no aircraft, no fixed route, nothing. We will never know what the next day will bring. For me, this is the ultimate challenge. Work in Arctic stations has, of late, become quite comfortable. I've read many books about what 'real' expeditions were like, but I never thought it would be possible to participate in such an adventure. \n               Where will you be at the winter solstice? \n             I'll be drifting in the Arctic Ocean, somewhere near the North Pole, on an ice floe some 2 kilometres across and 3 metres thick. A suitable floe is being sought now. The Russians will build a makeshift research base on it made of prefabricated wooden cabins. \n               What will your daily routine be? \n             I'll be in charge of a small 'aerological' station, doing a range of atmospheric and meteorological measurements. I'll also use radiosondes and a tethered balloon to make a profile of the ozone and aerosol concentrations in the lowest layer of the atmosphere. Such high-resolution measurements have never been taken before at such high latitudes. At the end of each day, I'll transmit the most basic data to Germany. Satellite communication beyond 80\u00b0 N is extremely slow, so this will take some time. Other than that, the days will be punctuated by the meals we'll eat together. \n               Russia is claiming parts of the Arctic. Is there a political background to the project? \n             The expedition is not equipped to search for geological evidence that could back up such claims. During preparatory meetings, the plans for exactly what the Russian team will do have had a low profile, but I doubt that any ill will is intended. The Russians have been using drifting stations for more than 50 years, and this is the first time a foreigner has been invited, which signals improved scientific openness towards the West. There's an agreement that all data will be made openly available as well. \n               What can go wrong? \n             You need to be constantly aware of polar bears. All team members have been trained to shoot. Also, the floe might become unstable or break. The worst case would be if the floe were to sink.

Campuses at the University of California are fighting a move to restrict their interactions with industry representatives. Last year, officials at the University of California proposed a set of draft guidelines to govern how industry representatives can influence students and employees of the university's health sciences facilities and campuses, including medical and pharmacy schools. The measures would ban free gifts and samples for clinicians, catered lunches for medical students and so-called unrestricted research grants from industry. But on 12 July, the campuses roundly rejected the proposed guidelines, calling them \u201cunacceptably vague, overbroad, and impinging on academic freedom\u201d. Speaking on behalf of the campuses, the system-wide academic council recommended that the university's president ditch the guidelines altogether. \u201cThe Academic Council... respectfully requests that the [University of California Office of the President's] Office of Clinical Services withdraw this proposal at this time,\u201d wrote academic council chair John Oakley, a law professor at the University of California, Davis, in a letter to the University of California president's office. The president's office will review the recommendations and decide how to proceed, said office spokesperson Jennifer Ward. The move bucks a recent trend of medical schools clamping down on the close relationships that industry cultivates with faculty and students. Medical schools across the nation, from Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut, to Stanford University in Palo Alto, California, have passed rules restricting gifts, free lunches and money that often flows freely from pharmaceutical companies, medical device manufacturers and other industry sources to doctors, researchers and students. The bans have been sparked in part by an article published in January last year  (T. A. Brennan  et al .  J. Am. Med. Assoc.   295,  429\u2013433; 2006) . In the article, doctors and researchers called on academic medical centres to tighten their policies to eliminate conflicts of interest between their employees and faculties and industry. But under president Robert Dynes, the University of California has gone in the opposite direction, cultivating close relationships with industry that have caused controversy. For instance, some members of the faculty of the University of California, Berkeley have protested against a $500 million deal their campus signed with the energy company BP in February (see  Nature   445 , 688\u2013689; doi:10.1038/445688b 2007 ). And for several years the university has been embroiled in a debate about whether it should accept research funding from tobacco companies (see  Nature   446 , 242; 2007). This worries academics such as Lisa Bero, a professor of clinical pharmacy and health policy at the University of California, San Francisco, who studies the way such 'unrestricted' funding can influence both research and clinical practice ( Br. Med. J.   326,  1167\u20131170; 2003 ). Bero calls the academic council's attempt to derail the university's vendor policy \u201cdisappointing\u201d. She notes that no University of California school has implemented a comprehensive ban on gifts and other industry influence on campus, and disputes the academic freedom argument cited in opposition to the proposed system-wide policy. \u201cThe evidence we have shows that whether they're called unrestricted or not, a lot of these grants do have strings attached,\u201d Bero says.

A belief in God may have promoted the evolution of cooperative behaviour, say Canadian psychologists. They found that priming people with religious concepts makes them more generous \u2014 regardless of whether they declare themselves to be believers.  Notions of civic responsibility also promote cooperation, suggesting that religion might encourage altruism by invoking an omniscient judge of behaviour. \"One idea that we seriously considered was that God, to those who believe, is a supernatural policing agent,\" says psychologist Azim Shariff of the University of British Columbia in Vancouver. \"We started to wonder whether civic [responsibilities] and religion operated all that differently within the unconscious mind.\" To investigate how belief in supernatural agents might influence cooperation, Shariff and his colleague Ara Norenzayan used a word game to stealthily introduce religious concepts to their subjects. Participants had to unscramble five-word sentences, dropping an extraneous word from each to create a grammatical four-word sentence. For example, \"felt she eradicate spirit the\" would become \"she felt the spirit,\" and \"dessert divine was fork the\" could become \"the dessert was divine.\" A control group unscrambled sentences made up of non-spiritual words.  \n              Share and share alike \n            After this exercise, the participants played an economic decision-making game. Each player was given $10 to share with an anonymous recipient. Participants primed with religious concepts gave their partner an average of $4.22, compared with only $1.84 in the control group. But those who declared themselves religious before the study were no more generous than non-believers. \"The effect of the religious prime was both large and surprising, especially considering that during exit interviews the participants were unaware of having been religiously primed,\" says Shariff.   A second study introduced a third group, primed with words associated with civic responsibility such as \"jury\", contract\", and \"police.\" This group behaved almost identically to that primed with religious concepts.  \n              Common functions \n            \"This research is really ground-breaking,\" says social psychologist Adam Cohen at Arizona State University, Tempe. \"The subtle prime of religion is one of the greatest strengths of this research because it does not tip people off to what the study is about.\"  But why such priming makes people more charitable is unclear. \"The fact that primes to civic institutions also produced more charitable behaviour gives some clues,\" he says. \"Perhaps religion and these civic institutions have certain functions or effects in common.\" Whether religion and civic responsibilities are equally effective spurs to cooperation remains to be seen. \"We can't compare the relative strengths of religion and civics, or draw tight analogies to real-world situations,\" says Shariff. \"What we can do is identify that both concepts have substantial effects on prosocial behaviour.\" \n             Visit our  \n             \n                 newsblog \n               \n              to read and post comments about this story. \n           \n                   Religion and science in focus \n                 \n                   Azim Sharrif \n                 Reprints and Permissions"},

There is no evidence that short-term exposure to signals from mobile telephone masts causes illness, say British researchers who have carried out a trial involving dozens of people who claim to be sensitive to the signals. Participants in the study could not tell whether or not they were being exposed to an electromagnetic field. The results suggest that the many health problems attributed to mobile phone transmitters \u2014 including nausea, headache and flu-like symptoms \u2014 are probably caused by something else, says Elaine Fox, a psychologist at the University of Essex in Colchester, who led the research. She suggests that the problems may well be psychological.  \n              Sensitive tests \n            Roughly 4% of Britons claim to be affected by radio waves from sources such as telephone transmitters and other electrical equipment. Fox and her colleagues tested 44 people who claimed to suffer various illnesses as a result of exposure to mobile telephone signals, and 114 people who did not. They used a laboratory set-up containing a replica transmitter broadcasting both conventional and '3G' telephone signals. When told that the transmitter was switched on for 50 minutes, 'sensitive' individuals reported higher anxiety, discomfort and tension. But when asked to tell whether the transmitter was on or off, only two of the 44 'sensitive' volunteers were correct six times out of six. Five of the controls were equally successful. And the severity of symptoms reported by the volunteers, as well as their heart rate and levels of sweating, did not depend on whether the transmitter was switched on or off, the researchers report in the journal  Environmental Health Perspectives 1 . This suggests that although peoples' symptoms are genuine, they may be triggered by the knowledge that they are near a telephone mast, rather than being an effect of the electromagnetic waves themselves. That makes sense, given that humans, unlike some other animals such as sharks, have no sensory cells that can detect electromagnetic waves. As Fox and her colleagues point out, there is no established mechanism by which telephone signals can cause illness.  \n              Psychological trigger \n            \"At least under short-term exposure there don't seem to be any adverse health effects,\" says Fox. She admits, however, that more research is needed to rule out long-term health effects for those living or working near telephone masts. Fox also says that several 'electrosensitive' people dropped out of the study before they could complete the testing, meaning that the number of volunteers was lower than the researchers had hoped. But she says that 44 volunteers are enough to statistically rule out adverse health effects. \"I had great hopes that this study would find something, and I was surprised it didn't,\" says Alasdair Philips of Powerwatch, a campaign group based near Cambridge that lobbies on behalf of 'electrosensitive' people. He admits that psychological triggering is a possible mechanism, but adds that \"many electrosensitive people get panicked by phones, but that doesn't mean the effect isn't real in the first place\".  \"It's probably time now to start really looking at what is causing this,\" Fox says. \"Many of these people genuinely have a very poor quality of life. If people are convinced that it is electromagnetic fields then they don't look at other possibilities.\" Psychological triggering remains the most plausible mechanism. \"If we have a headache on the train and we see someone with a mobile phone, you can make a connection. It's quite a natural thing,\" Fox adds. \n             Visit our  \n             \n                 newsblog \n               \n              to read and post comments about this story. \n           \n                   Health and medicine news \n                 \n                   Technology news \n                 \n                   Environmental Health Perspectives \n                 \n                   University of Essex Electromagnetics and Health Lab \n                 \n                   Powerwatch \n                 Reprints and Permissions"},

A French government aircraft carrying six medical workers convicted of deliberately infecting children with HIV touched down in Sofia, Bulgaria, on 24 July, ending their 8-year ordeal in a Libyan prison. The five Bulgarian nurses and a Palestinian doctor \u2014 given life sentences after more than 400 children contracted HIV at the hospital they worked at in Benghazi in 1998 \u2014 were immediately pardoned by Bulgarian President Georgi Parvanov. The charges, denied by the six, have been condemned as baseless by scientists, who argued that the outbreak was accidental and caused by inadequate sanitary precautions at the hospital. Their release is the final scene in meticulously crafted negotiations between the European Union (EU) and Libya, which sought a way for Libya to climb down on the case without being seen to concede to Western pressure. Diplomatic efforts intensified as a result of international public and political outcry after the six medical workers were sentenced to death in a retrial on 19 December 2006. Then, on 17 July, Libya's highest judicial body commuted their sentences to life imprisonment, over-ruling the death-penalty verdict upheld a few days earlier by the Supreme Court (see  Nature   448 , 230\u2013231; 2007). That move came after families of the children each received US$1 million per child in 'compensation' from an international fund set up by the EU, Bulgaria and Libya.  Nature  understands that most of money is in fact likely to have been paid by Libya itself, and that the move allowed Libya to save face. The EU also agreed to provide humanitarian aid for long-term treatment of the infected children. Libya has long used the six medical workers as bargaining chips and political pawns in its international relations. Right until the final hour of their release, Libya haggled to win further concessions to improve its political and trade ties with the EU. Benita Ferrero-Waldner, the European commissioner for external relations, was also on the aircraft with the freed health workers. She, the EU and Britain, were the main players working patiently behind the scenes to secure the release. On the Libyan side, the key force in freeing the workers was Seif al-Islam Gaddafi, son of the Libyan leader Muammar al-Gaddafi, through his charity the Gaddafi Development Foundation. He is thought to be personally convinced that the outbreak was accidental. More controversial is the role played by another passenger on the plane, French first lady C\u00e9cilia Sarkozy. France has not had a prominent role in the negotiations, and her last-minute intervention is widely considered to be a thinly veiled bid by her husband to steal the limelight that may, in fact, have weakened the EU's negotiating position in the talks. \u201cThe efforts to mobilize Western governments to act by increasing international public opinion have paid off,\u201d says Emmanuel Altit, a lawyer from the medical workers' international defence team. The concerted efforts of the scientific community around the case played a \u201cfundamental role\u201d in changing the trajectory of the case and helping to secure today's outcome, he adds. \u201cIt's great news,\u201d says Vittorio Colizzi, an AIDS researcher at Tor Vergata University in Rome, Italy, who campaigned for scientific evidence exonerating the medical workers to be considered by the Libyan courts. \u201cBut we must not forget the children,\u201d he adds, pointing out that the 1998 outbreak was a double tragedy \u2014 for the six unjustly imprisoned, and for the infected children and families. \n                     High noon in Libya \n                   \n                     Libyan court upholds death sentences \n                   \n                     Diplomatic talks spur hope in Libya HIV case \n                   \n                     Europe condemns Libyan trial verdict \n                   \n                     Medics sentenced to death in Libya \n                   \n                     Web focus AIDS medics in Libya \n                   \n                     Nature newsblog \n                   \n                     \u201cYou are not alone\u201d campaign \n                   \n                     European Union site on Libya \n                   \n                     Gaddafi Foundation for Development \n                   \n                     Declan Butler blog on case \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

But geologists speaking to  Nature  dismissed the hype, pointing out that the lake dried up thousands of years ago and that it will not necessarily be surrounded by aquifers holding ancient water. Furthermore, they say that the lake was identified in the 1800s, and that its size and shape were detailed over a decade ago. The press release from Boston University \u2014 entitled 'Mapping of ancient mega-lake by Boston University scientists catalyst for global humanitarian outreach' \u2014 announced a '1,000 Wells for Darfur' initiative to drill around the lake \u201cto create new groundwater resources to help establish peace and economic security in the region.\u201d The initiative was launched by the government of Sudan after a meeting between President Omar al-Bashir and geologist Farouk El-Baz, director of the Boston University Center for Remote Sensing. El-Baz had announced the discovery of the 30,750 square kilometre lake \u2014 which would have contained around 2,500 cubic kilometres of water \u2014 in April, after scouring Landsat satellite images and sand-penetrating radar data from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission. The media's portrayal of a lake that actually contains water now stems from the way the Boston group presented its claims, says Mohamed Abubuker, an official at the Ministry of Irrigation and Water Resources in Khartoum. \u201cThe general public in Sudan, and even some very high-ranking officials, came to believe that what has been discovered is literally a lake \u2014 perhaps even with fish in it,\u201d he says. \u201cThe way El-Baz presented his efforts helped consolidate this misconception. It was like a political rally for a presidency run-up rather than a scientific portrayal of facts.\u201d El-Baz contests this allegation. \u201cIt is incomprehensible for anyone to think it is a physical lake,\u201d he says, adding that he consistently made it clear that his argument was that the lake's water would have seeped through the sandstone substrate to accumulate as groundwater, and that drilling the sandstone under and around the ancient lake could yield fresh water. The Sahara region is known to have been rainy in past millennia, and this ancient water exists as groundwater in the so-called Nubian sandstone aquifer that stretches across Chad, Libya, Egypt and Sudan. The International Atomic Energy Agency, based in Geneva, has a programme to manage this aquifer. Geologists argue that the rocks beneath and around the ancient lake are no more likely to hold water than those elsewhere in the Nubian aquifer. \u201cNearly everywhere it is present in Egypt the Nubian sandstone is water-bearing, so it is a matter of simple common sense that it would be the first place to look for significant groundwater reserves in Sudan,\u201d says Neil Sturchio, a geologist at the University of Illinois in Chicago, who describes the lake story as \u201chype\u201d. There may actually be less chance of finding substantial water in the lake vicinity in northern Darfur than elsewhere on the aquifer. Although the porous, water-retaining sandstone aquifer is up to 3,500 metres thick at its northern fringes in Egypt, it thins to just a few hundred metres in northern Darfur, its southernmost reach. Alain Gachet, a French geologist who has spent decades exploring for oil and water in the region, says that the configuration of rocks in the vicinity of the lake makes substantial water reserves even more unlikely. The lake is in an uplifted area, which has accelerated the erosion of the Nubian sandstones underneath, he says, and he claims that the lake is probably underlain by a crust of granite and other impermeable rocks rather than sandstone. \u201cThere is obviously no trace of water at the bottom of this lake. In the best case, it would be so salty that it would be undrinkable,\u201d says Gachet, who uses radar remote-sensing techniques to detect aquifers close to the surface and is working with UN agencies to map potential wells across Darfur. El-Baz admits there is a real possibility that there may be little sandstone in contact with the lake, but argues that this can be established only by drilling and geophysical surveys. \u201cGachet is right to say the lake has dried up, but not if he says that some of its water would not be held beneath the desert surface,\u201d he says, \u201cNo one can paint the subsurface picture with the available information.\u201d Mike Edwards, of the Centre for Water Research at the University of Oxford, UK, says that it is misleading to suggest that groundwater will be found if the area of a former palaeolake is drilled. He adds that \u201cthere is no substitute for drilling as far as groundwater resources are concerned \u2014 but there will already be quite a few wells in this area. El-Baz's work is certainly not innovative.\u201d Even if extensive water resources were to be found in northern Darfur, this would do little to alleviate the situation in western and southern Darfur, where current needs are greatest, say geologists. The geology of these areas is mainly impermeable rock, with only a few outcrops of sandstone aquifer. If the Darfur aquifer did yield water it would only be a stop-gap solution as the aquifer is not being replenished by rainfall and the fossil water reserves are finite, says Johanna Kieniewicz, an expert on the Nubian aquifer at Denison University in Granville, Ohio. \u201cIt's essentially 'mining' groundwater,\u201d she says, adding that many of the oases in Egypt feeding off the Nubian aquifer have only around 50 years of water supply left. The widespread notion that water is at the origin of the Darfur genocide, and so could be a solution, is also simplistic say experts. That idea has been perpetuated by Ban Ki-moon, secretary-general of the United Nations, who recently painted the genocide as a tragic result of resource scarcity. But experts on the region argue that the true culprit is the National Islamic Front, which came to power in Khartoum in 1989 and has since expanded its political base though ethnic cleansing (see  Nature   447 , 1038; doi:10.1038/4471038b 2007 ). Al-Bashir is himself allied to the National Islamic Front. El-Baz defends obtaining support from such sources, and says his own efforts are apolitical. \u201cThis is science in the service of a humanitarian cause.\u201d And even the novelty of the mega-lake 'discovery', which is to be published in the  International Journal of Remote Sensing , has been questioned. Geologists claims that the palaeolake was identified by German scientists in 1985 and mapped during the 1990s. El-Baz admitted to  Nature  that the ancient lake deposits he claimed to have found had already been discovered, but says that new satellite data allowed his group to map its full extent. \n                     Darfur's climate roots challenged \n                   \n                     BrightEarth project shows up dark deeds \n                   \n                     Climate Change 2007: How to survive a warming world \n                   \n                     Geologists call for desalination of Gaza Strip's water \n                   \n                     Climate change \n                   \n                     Boston University Center for Remote Sensing \n                   \n                     IAEA Nubian Sandstone Aquifer System project \n                   \n                     Sudan Post-Conflict Environmental Assessment \n                   \n                     Ban Ki-Moon in The Washington Post \n                   \n                     Social Science Research Council's Darfur blog \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

But is this testimony to successful plant design or a warning of impending disaster? After the stunning revelation that the nuclear power plant damaged in an earthquake last week was built above an active fault line, Japan faces an uphill struggle to convince its citizens, and the rest of the world, that its commitment to nuclear power is safe. Perched on top of four converging tectonic plates, Japan is one of the most earthquake-prone countries \u2014 geological instability causes around 1,000 tremors a year there. And yet, with 55 operating reactors, it has the third largest nuclear generation capacity in the world \u2014 behind France and the United States. With few indigenous energy resources, Japan relies on nuclear power for about a third of its needs, and aims to up this to 40% in an ambitious expansion programme that will see 11 new facilities built by 2017. This tricky dichotomy was brought into stark relief on 16 July when a magnitude-6.8 earthquake caused a shut down of the Kashiwazaki-Kariwa plant, in Niigata prefecture on the west coast. The damage to the facility was relatively minor, no one died and the amount of radiation released was reportedly negligible \u2014 well within international safety limits. Nevertheless, the incident has sparked fears that neither Japan's nuclear facilities nor its nuclear safety evaluation system can handle the seismic activity that plagues the country (see  'The big one' ). The quake \u2014 which killed ten people and injured more than 1,000 in Niigata \u2014 sparked a fire in a transformer that supplies electricity to one of Kashiwazaki-Kariwa's seven reactors and leaked radioactive cooling water into the sea and gas into the atmosphere. The plant \u2014 the world's largest in terms of power output \u2014 has been shut indefinitely. International observers have described the handling of the incident by its owner, Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO), as a public-relations disaster, especially in light of the country's history (see  'A shaky nuclear record' ). \n               Catalogue of errors \n             Because the earthquake occurred on a national holiday, only four people were available to fight the transformer blaze, so it took around 90 minutes and the help of local firefighters to put it out. The public were not informed of the incident for seven hours, and the disclosures of leaks and malfunctions trickled out over several days. TEPCO initially said that 100 drums of solid nuclear waste had fallen over, but inspectors later said hundreds had been knocked over, and the lids of several dozen had opened, spilling their contents. The list of malfunctions, damages and mistakes rose from an initial 50 to 63 in the ensuing days, and included an admission by the company that the 1,200 litres of contaminated water that poured into the ocean was 50% more radioactive than it had previously stated. Perhaps most worrying was the discovery, nearly three days after the quake, that radioactive iodine gas was still being vented from one of the reactors. TEPCO built the facility to withstand a magnitude 6.5 quake \u2014 the Japanese safety standard for reactors located on sites not above an active fault line. But it has now emerged that the offshore epicentre of last week's quake is on an active fault line that probably extends directly under the Kashiwazaki-Kariwa plant. A preliminary investigation of the quake and its aftershocks has revealed a fault line of up to 30 kilometres long. Akira Fukushima, of Japan's Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency in Tokyo, says that four fault lines were identified at the site in 1980 before the facility was built, but that all were considered inactive.  Nature  has heard claims from Japan's seismologists that data indicating an active fault line was potentially under the site were ignored when the plant was enlarged. Hiroaki Nakata, a seismologist at the Hiroshima Institute of Technology, says that TEPCO found a seven-kilometre-long fault line in 1996, during investigations as part of its application to install two new reactors on the plant, but failed to investigate it fully. Nakata has produced a map showing where fault lines taken from TEPCO data should have extended. \u201cWhen we find an active fault, we check features surrounding it. There's no reason for TEPCO to have stopped when they did. There are many places where they missed \u2014 or intentionally avoided \u2014 seeing fault lines,\u201d Nakata says. Daisuke Suzuki, TEPCO spokesman for the Kashiwazaki-Kariwa plant, says of new guidelines to govern reactors and quake resistance, \u201cThe 2007 guidelines require us to look back 130,000 years, rather than the previous 50,000, so we might find evidence that it was active.\u201d \u201cThe new guidelines also require geomorphological techniques to be used now, which may have revealed that the fault was longer if we had used them before,\u201d Suzuki says. He admits the earthquake was probably caused by movement of this fault. \u201cIf so, it must be longer than seven kilometres to have caused such a large earthquake.\u201d \n               Blind thrusts \n             The new guidelines \u2014 under which all 55 reactors are being re-evaluated \u2014 are an improvement, says Katsuhiko Ishibashi, a seismologist at Kobe University's Research Centre for Urban Safety and Security and a member of a 2006 government subcommittee to revise them. For example, the method to estimate ground shaking is better. But his proposal to reconsider the survey standards for active faults in the guidelines was dismissed by the committee. The guidelines also failed to factor in the effects of 'blind thrusts' \u2014 movements that cannot be seen by seismologists but can cause quakes with magnitudes of greater than 6.5. Ishibashi says that \u201cthe committee's misunderstanding leads to a strong underestimation of powerful earthquakes\u201d. On the day of the last committee meeting, Ishibashi resigned in protest. So is it safe to build a nuclear facility on such shaky ground? Scott Burnell, a spokesperson for the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission in Maryland, argues that they can endure floods, tornadoes, hurricanes, earthquakes and even a tsunami. \u201cThey are designed to withstand just about everything short of a meteor strike,\u201d he says. The worldwide track record in nuclear versus nature has been good. In 1992, a 690-megawatt reactor at Turkey Point in Florida weathered the winds of Hurricane Andrew. And in 2004, the Kalpakkam reactor near Madras, India, emerged unscathed from a massive tsunami that engulfed the city in which it was located. Sensors detected the rising water level and shut down the reactor before the tsunami reached the shore. Most observers agree that the Kashiwazaki-Kariwa reactor seems to have performed well. Despite being designed for a lower-magnitude quake, the reactor buildings are mostly intact. Mitsuru Uesaka, a nuclear engineer at the University of Tokyo, says that given the difference between the expected shaking and that experienced, \u201cthis case is close to the worst scenario. Even so, the leaked radiation was negligible,\u201d he says.

Diamonds may not be for ever: researchers think they have seen, for the first time, the molten form of what is arguably the world's hardest material. Jianyu Huang of Sandia National Laboratories in New Mexico heated diamond, at high pressure, to more than 2,000 \u00b0C inside microscopic hollow shells of carbon and watched the diamond soften ( J. Y. Huang  Nano Lett.  doi:10.1021/nl0709975; 2007 ). Huang describes this as quasi-melting. It is not true melting, he says, because the diamond particles don't become liquid carbon, but instead flicker between crystal forms by continually melting and instantly refreezing in a different conformation. This is the closest anyone has ever come to directly melting diamond. No one really knows what molten carbon looks like. One form, graphite, seems to break down into liquid-like blobs when heated to high temperatures, although they have not been examined while still molten. But until now, molten diamond had not been achieved. A key problem is that when diamond is heated to very high temperatures, at atmospheric pressure, it turns into graphite rather than melting. To overcome this, Huang's team used structures known as 'carbon onions' to create very high pressures and temperatures. These roughly spherical concentric shells of graphite-like carbon act as high-pressure cells that shrink when blasted with a beam of electrons. As they contract, the material in their centres is squeezed to very high pressures. Previous studies by Florian Banhart of the Institute for Physical Chemistry in Mainz, Germany, and Pulickel Ajayan of the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, New York, showed that graphite-like carbon in the onion's centre can be converted to diamond in these chambers (F. Banhart and P. M. Ajayan  Nature   382 , 433\u2013435; 1996). Huang's team used carbon onions with a carbon nanotube attached to the outside. They wired up the nanotube and heated the tube\u2013onion composite while irradiating it with electrons. Huang estimates that this created temperatures of more than 2,000 \u00b0C and pressures of around 400,000 atmospheres at the core. As the onions shrank, the carbon at the centre was transformed from graphite to diamond. When this got hot enough, it adopted the fluctuating quasi-molten state, Huang explains. Ultimately, he hopes, it will be possible to make fully molten diamond, so that the onions have liquid carbon cores. But not everyone is confident that the diamond is really melting. Although Banhart says the new work is interesting, he thinks that the carbon may instead be switching between diamond and graphite \u2014 each time it returns to diamond, the crystals will look different, he says. \n                     Liquid diamond and carbon spaghetti \n                   \n                     Just a pretty phase? \n                   \n                     Nanotube sheets come of age \n                   \n                     Nanotubes may have no 'temperature' \n                   \n                     Paper \n                   \n                     P.

The physical changes that occur when the brain makes a new memory have been observed for the first time, say researchers, who hope to go on to map the distribution of memory across brain regions. Gary Lynch of the University of California, Irvine, and his colleagues examined the junctions between neurons \u2014 synapses \u2014 in three dimensions using a technique called restorative deconvolution microscopy (RDM). This consists of a sensitive light microscope with computer algorithms that analyse light scattered above and below the focal point, producing a three-dimensional 'trace' of an object's structure. In previous work, the group developed a fluorescent marker that attaches to synapses in the brain that have recently undergone a certain type of neuron-to-neuron connection believed to be responsible for encoding memory, called long-term potentiation (LTP) ( L. Y. Chen  et al .  J. Neurosci.   27,  5363\u20135372; 2007 ). The team exposed live rats to a novel environment and allowed them to learn its layout. They then removed the animals' brains to examine the hippocampus \u2014 a region involved in memory \u2014 using RDM to observe individual synapses. A second group of rats was shown the new environment but not allowed to explore it before their brains were examined. Only rats that had undergone learning and memory acquisition showed new synaptic growth, Lynch says ( V. Fedulov  et al .  J. Neurosci.   27,  8031\u20138039; 2007 ). And the hippocampal synapses to which the LTP fluorescent marker attached were 50% larger than other synapses not involved in LTP. Furthermore, when the group looked at hippocampal slices from a third group of rats, which had been allowed to learn the same new environment but been given a drug to block LTP, the synapses showed no new growth, and were similar to those of the second group. This indicates that the new synaptic growth observed in the study is a result of LTP, Lynch asserts. \u201cWe saw that the synapses had actually changed shape as a result of the new memory,\u201d Lynch says. \u201cThey went from oval to circles, which have a greater surface area.\u201d He now aims to use the technique to see which other areas of the brain might be involved in memory.

Researchers have used a recently discovered form of carbon to make sheets of super-stiff and super-strong paper that is only a few millionths of a metre thick. This paper could lead to the development of tough new materials or be used to store energy for fuel cell applications. Graphene, discovered in 2004, is tougher than diamond. It is composed of atom-thick sheets of carbon atoms arranged in a two-dimensional honeycomb structure. But unless they are anchored to some other material, these sheets spontaneously scrunch up into little balls and form a graphene 'soup'. Rodney Ruoff, at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois, and his colleagues have now found a way of making free-standing sheets of graphene 'paper'. The researchers took graphite oxide, a layered material, split it into microscopic individual plates, and then used a flow of water to stick these tiny plates together in a flat paper-like structure. Water acts as a glue between the layers of graphene, because hydrogen bonds form between the water molecules and the graphene strips.  The result was a sheet of graphene oxide, consisting of overlapping particles a bit like the scales of a fish. These sheets were only a few micrometres thick. \"You can't make non-coagulating graphene but you can make non-coagulating graphene oxide,\" says Andre Geim, a graphene pioneer at the University of Manchester, UK. The graphene oxide will have similar chemical properties to pure graphene, he says. Ruoff tested his paper against bucky paper (based on C 60 ), flexible graphite and vermiculite, and says that his paper outperforms the other carbon-based papers in terms of tensile strength and stiffness. These papers are used commercially as lubricants and seals for gaskets. Like normal paper, the sheets are stiff and strong in one direction \u2014 thanks to the hydrogen bonds holding the small pieces of graphene together \u2014 but bendy. \"In plane they're very stiff, but they're also very compliant,\" says Ruoff, \"so they can be folded.\"  \n              Sticking point \n            The paper could be made even stronger and stiffer by tinkering with the glue between the layers, says Ruoff \u2014 that is, by replacing the hydrogen bonds with other, stronger groups. \"If you want to make the stiffest, strongest material ever you need to choose components at the molecular level that are strong and tough,\" he says.  Geim agrees: \"What immediately comes to mind is you can think about really good binders for the [graphene] planes and make very tough materials.\" Applications are still a long way off, but could be wide-ranging, says Ruoff. For example, the paper could form large membranes in conducting materials; or the gap between the layers where the molecular 'glue' sits could be used to as a way to store energy for fuel cells, he says. \n             Visit our  \n             \n                 newsblog \n               \n              to read and post comments about this story. \n           \n                   , graphene special issue \n                 Reprints and Permissions"},

Ozone is already known to be a minor greenhouse gas, but the new calculations highlight another, indirect way in which it is likely to influence global warming by 2100. High levels can poison plants and reduce their ability to photosynthesize, says Stephen Sitch of the UK Met Office's Hadley Centre for Climate Prediction and Research in Exeter. Whereas ozone high in the stratosphere shields Earth from solar ultraviolet rays, high levels of ozone closer in are toxic to plants and animals. Ozone is generated when oxides of nitrogen \u2014 chiefly from vehicle exhausts and fossil-fuel power stations \u2014 react with other chemicals in the air. Many of the world's most polluted areas routinely endure ozone concentrations higher than 40 parts per billion, enough to damage plant life. By the end of the century, virtually all the world's populated areas are predicted to be above this threshold. Plant growth is a vital carbon sink, estimated to suck up around a quarter of the CO 2  emitted into the atmosphere. \u201cThis study combines knowledge about ecosystem function with atmospheric chemistry, and that's never been done before,\u201d says Sitch. \u201cNo one has considered the detrimental effect of ozone on plants.\u201d The issue is complicated by the intricate interplay between rising CO 2  levels, which boost plant growth, and increasing ozone, which stunts it. Some ecosystem models had predicted that the rise in CO 2  expected over the coming century might be offset by the expected boost in the growth of forests and swamps. But factoring in ozone means that it looks less likely that this carbon sink will grow fast enough to keep pace with the increasing emissions. Eva Pell, who studies the effects of ozone on plants at Pennsylvania State University in University Park and who was not involved in the study, finds the results credible. \u201cThere is no doubt that ozone reduces CO 2  fixation,\u201d she says. \u201cIt makes sense that the adverse effects of ozone would be dampened by elevated CO 2 , and the ability of plants to serve as carbon stores in an elevated CO 2  environment would be reduced by elevated ozone.\u201d In 1901, according to the researchers' calculations, plant growth was responsible for storing 113 billion tonnes of carbon worldwide. By 2100, this figure is predicted to be 171 billion tonnes \u2014 without ozone it would be more than 200 billion tonnes, they say. Their results are published online this week ( S. Sitch et al. Nature doi:10.1038/nature06059; 2007 ). Different plant species vary in their sensitivity to ozone, and these figures reflect predictions based on a fairly high average level of toxicity, says team member Bill Collins of the Met Office. But even in the researchers' low-sensitivity calculations, there's likely to be a dent of around 15 billion tonnes in overall carbon sequestration as a result of the effects of ozone. \u201cThe bottom line is that ozone is a greenhouse gas, so it's known to contribute to the greenhouse effect. Our study says you should double that predicted contribution,\u201d says Collins. Unlike most greenhouse gases, ozone is a short-lived, regional pollutant that can be tackled at an individual level using catalytic converters, for example, to reduce precursors to ozone, Sitch suggests. \n                     US pushes limits on ozone destroyer \n                   \n                     Hikes in surface ozone could suffocate crops \n                   \n                     Iraqi fire pollution rivalled volcano \n                   \n                     Climate change could boost cash crops \n                   \n                     Trees grow faster in the city \n                   \n                     Climate change in focus \n                   \n                     Chemistry news \n                   \n                     Earth and environment news \n                   \n                     Ecology and evolution news \n                   \n                     http://www.nature.com/news/specials/nuclear/index.html \n                   \n                     Hadley Centre for Climate Prediction and Research \n                   \n                     Met Office \n                   \n                     SoyFACE \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Grey matter in the brains of people with bipolar disorder is destroyed with each manic or depressive episode. This was the finding of an MRI study of 21 patients with bipolar disorder, a mental illness marked by successive episodes of mania followed by deep depression. The patients' brains were scanned at either end of a four-year period, during which time each patient had at least one episode and some as many as six. In all cases, the amount of grey matter in the temporal lobe and the cerebellum decreased compared to the grey matter in control subjects. These areas of the brain are associated with memory and coordination.  Patients that had suffered more episodes over the four years had the most marked difference in the amount of grey matter that had disappeared. \"It was significantly correlated to the number of episodes,\" says Andrew McIntosh, from the University of Edinburgh, and lead author of the paper out today in the  Journal of Biological Psychiatry . Everyone loses brain tissue over time, but the process seems to be accelerated in people with some mental conditions, including schizophrenia and Alzheimer's disease. Now bipolar disorder joins this list. Scientists already had a hunch that bipolar disorder was related to a loss of grey matter, says Lars Kessing at the University of Copenhagen \u2014 this is the first evidence to prove them right.  \n              Language skills \n            When McIntosh compared the loss of grey matter with the patients' verbal IQ scores at the beginning and end of the study, he noticed a trend between the two; as grey matter was destroyed the ability of the patients to describe words and perform other language-association tasks declined. McIntosh adds that the effect wasn't enough to be statistically significant \u2014 possibly because the sample size of 21 was too small. Grey matter has been previously linked to intelligence (see ' Grey matter matters for intellect '). McIntosh also looked to see if the effect had anything to do with medication \u2014 bipolar patients are often prescribed lithium, antidepressants or antipsychotics. \"Medication didn't appear to be interfering,\" he says, but adds that it would going too far to say that medication couldn't affect the deterioration of the brain. For example, medication could be used to limit the number of manic/depressive episodes, which he says now appears to be an important factor in the extent of damage seen in the brain. \"This suggests that we have to be more eager at trying to prevent manic and depressive episodes,\" agrees Kessing.  McIntosh's team are now looking more closely at factors that might contribute to the grey-matter loss. These could be related to stress hormones, he says, or could be genetic. Researchers note that simply being grumpy or excited from time to time is not likely to destroy your brain. \"It's not if you just feel moody,\" explains Kessing, \"this patient population has quite severe bipolar disorder.\" \n             Visit our  \n             \n                 newsblog \n               \n              to read and post comments about this story. \n           Reprints and Permissions"},

Mexican fishermen call it  diablo rojo  \u2014 the red devil. A film-maker wears armour when he goes near it. And the Humboldt, or jumbo, squid ( Dosidicus gigas ) is on the move, swimming north from the tropics and eating its way into commercial fish stocks. Changing ocean conditions and fewer predators \u2014 coupled with the squid's ecological flexibility \u2014 are the likeliest reason for the species' expansion, says Bruce Robison, a marine biologist at Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute in California, who has led a survey of the animal's movements. Humboldt squid can grow to 50 kilograms and 2 metres. They have more than a thousand barbed suckers to catch their prey and can swim at 43 kilometres per hour.  \"They'll eat anything they can catch,\" Robison says \u2014 including each other. \"When one member of a group is injured they become lunch for the others.\"  \n              North to Alaska \n            Originally, the squid lived only off the Pacific coast of South America. But in the 1970s, Mexican fisherman began to notice the animals further north in the Gulf of California. In the 1990s, California anglers started catching them and the squid has been spotted as far north as Alaska. To map the animal's migration, Robison and his colleague Lou Zeidberg analysed 16 years of deep-sea video footage captured by unmanned submersibles off the coast of central California. The videos showed a surge in squid numbers in 1997, an El Ni\u00f1o year when oceans warmed and currents reversed \u2014 flowing from south to north. The squid then vanished until 2002, another El Ni\u00f1o year. But this time, they stayed for good. Each time the Humboldts showed up, hake, the most abundant commercial fish on the West Coast, disappeared from the video footage. Squid stomachs contain lanternfish \u2014 their food of choice in Mexico \u2014 but hake as well, says Zeidberg. \"They can alter their diets based on what's around,\" he says.  \n              Not picky about its food \n            The march north can't be explained by warmer water alone, the team concludes. When the Pacific cooled after the 2002 El Ni\u00f1o, the animals stayed and reproduced. And even in the tropics, Humboldts live in cold water 1,000 metres down.  Meanwhile, the squid's predators, such as tuna and shark, have declined.  Bill Gilly, a marine biologist at Stanford University who is leading an effort to tag and track Humboldts, says their flexibility has allowed them to thrive while other more specialist animals fade. \"It's likely that this is a common theme over all the world's oceans,\" he says. Diver and film-maker Scott Cassell, of Escondido, California, says he has had hundreds of run-ins with the jumbo squid, from curious taps to charging attacks. Once, a squid yanked his arm out of its socket. \"My shoulder's never been the same,\" he says.  \n             Visit our  \n             \n                 newsblog \n               \n              to read and post comments about this story. \n           \n                   Tagging of Pacific Pelagics \n                 \n                   Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute \n                 Reprints and Permissions"},

Astronomers have found the largest negatively charged molecule so far seen in interstellar space. The discovery, of an organic compound, suggests that the chemical building blocks of life may be more common in the Universe than had been previously thought. The molecule is a chain of eight carbons and a single hydrogen called the octatetraynyl anion (C 8 H\u00af). Two teams of scientists have spotted it near a dying star and in a cloud of cold gas. The discovery, along with that of three smaller organic molecules in the past year, opens up a suite of potential chemical reactions and products. It suggests that 'prebiotic' molecules such as amino acids, the building blocks of protein, could form all over the Universe, says Tony Remijan, an astronomer at the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO) in Charlottesville, Virginia. Remijan's team spotted the octatetraynyl anion in a dense cloud of gas in the halo surrounding a dying star in the constellation Leo, 550 light years from Earth. They made the discovery using the Green Bank Telescope in West Virginia, a radio dish 100 metres across.  Another team from the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge, Massachusetts, used the same telescope to spot the compound in the Taurus Molecular Cloud (TMC), located 450 light years from Earth in the constellation Taurus. Both findings are published in the  Astrophysical Journal 1 , 2   \n              Watch this space \n            Negatively charged organic molecules such as the octatetraynyl anion were long thought to be confined to Earth. \"People thought they were too fragile to exist [in space],\" says Sandra Br\u00fcnken, a member of the Harvard-Smithsonian team. To show that octatetraynyl anion could be found in space, Br\u00fcnken made the compound, along with several similar ones, in the lab. She then measured the chemical's spectrum \u2014 the same property radio telescopes hunt for. With this in hand, the two teams sifted through radio telescope measurements to find the molecule.  Br\u00fcnken and her colleagues discovered the first interstellar organic anion \u2014 a chain of six carbons and one hydrogen \u2014 by chance in late 2006 when they noticed a blip in the measurements from the TMC. The spectrum hinted at a compound called hexatriynyl anion, but confirmation only came when they made the compound in the lab and found that the two signatures matched up. The researchers believe that even larger organic molecules are likely to be out there.

Human activity has made the weather wetter in a large slice of the Northern Hemisphere, say researchers. It has also made the regions just south of the Equator wetter, and those just north of it drier. Agriculture and human health have already been affected, Francis Zwiers of the Canadian Centre for Climate Modelling and Analysis in Toronto and his colleagues report in  Nature 1 . This is the first evidence that human activity has altered rainfall patterns. \"We expected rainfall patterns to change, but there's been no conclusive evidence that we are seeing human effects,\" says climate researcher Nathan Gillett, of University of East Anglia in Norwich, UK, one of the study's authors. \"This study shows we are.\" To show human influence, the researchers compared observed changes in rainfall during the twentieth century with those predicted by 14 climate models, divided into three groups. One group contained estimates of human greenhouse-gas emissions, one included only natural factors such as volcanic aerosols, and a third contained both. The models including both human and natural influences gave the best fit to the observed trends. In the zone between 40 and 70 \u00b0N, which includes much of North America and most of Europe, rainfall increased by 62 millimetres per century between 1925 and 1999. The researchers estimate that between 50 and 85% of this increase can be attributed to human activity.  Similarly, most of the wetter weather between 0 and 30 \u00b0S is down to human activity. Previous studies had not detected a human influence because the amount of global rainfall was analysed, which meant increases in some areas were masked by decreases in others.  \n              Drought and flooding \n            One place that has got drier is the Sahel region of Africa. Sandwiched between the Sahara and the rainforest belt, the Sahel experienced severe drought \u2014 and famine \u2014 between the 1950s and 1980s. \"If you look for the regions where both models and observations show a decrease in rainfall it's obviously made it harder to grow crops in those regions,\" says Gillett. \"In the far north we've seen an increase in average rainfall,\" he adds. \"That will have increased stream flow in rivers, which may have increased flooding in those regions.\"  The observed changes were larger than the models predicted, suggesting that projections of future human impact might be underestimates.  \"This is a very important paper,\" says climate researcher Myles Allen of the University of Oxford, UK. \"It identifies the fingerprint of human influence.

The mastodon, an extinct relative of modern elephants, has become the latest prehistoric animal to have its DNA sequenced.  Using a fossilized tooth, Michael Hofreiter of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany, and his colleagues sequenced all the DNA of the mastodon's mitochondrion, an energy-generating structure in the cell with its own small genome. The tooth is believed to be 50,000-130,000 years old, making the mastodon's the oldest complete mitochondrial genome decoded so far.  \"This extremely old and complete sequence is of interest in its own right,\" says Hofreiter. But it can also help to resolve debates about the ancestry of modern elephants.  Scientists have been unable to agree how the Asian elephants, African elephants and woolly mammoths are related. The problem is that elephants have no living close kin \u2014 their nearest relatives are the ocean-going dugong and the rodent-like hyrax.  But a family tree based on the DNA of elephants, mammoth and mastodon shows that Asian elephants are more closely related to mammoths than they are to African elephants. The results are reported in  PloS Biology 1 .  \n              A change in climate \n            The mastodon sequence also enabled the team to estimate that the African elephants split from Asian elephants and mammoths about 7.6 million years ago. Mammoths and Asian elephants parted ways less than a million years after this.  These dates \u2014 and the African location of the split \u2014 are strikingly similar to the divergence of humans, chimpanzees and gorillas, says Hofreiter. \"It's thought that the climate became drier, grassland expanded and forests became more fragmented,\" he notes. \"We need to look in more detail at what happened in other mammals.\"  Hofreiter's team found the mastodon tooth in a riverbed in northern Alaska, in sediment dated at 130,000 years old; the rest of the skeleton was missing. The DNA sequence shows that mastodons split from the ancestor of the elephants about 25 million years ago. Mastodons stood about three metres tall and looked a lot like mammoths, with thick fur and a stocky build. Unlike mammoths, however, they were mostly forest animals, browsing on leaves and breaking branches and twigs with their tusks. The animals appear in the fossil record about 28 million years ago, and survived in North America until about 10,000 years ago. The cause of their demise is controversial. \"Some blame environmental change and others blame human hunters,\" says Hofreiter.  \n              Ancient DNA \n            The oldest previous mitochondrial DNA genome sequenced belonged to a 33,000-year-old woolly mammoth.

Eske Willerslev of the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues recently sequenced mitochondrial DNA from beneath Greenland's ice sheet dated at between 450,000 and 800,000 years old (see ' DNA reveals a green Greenland ').   Some researchers have claimed finding 100-million-year-old bacterial DNA. But such claims do not convince Willerslev. \"These haven't received independent verification and the DNA is 99.9% similar to modern bacteria so it's very difficult to tell,\" he says.  \"Conceivably, DNA could survive for several million years at very low temperatures,\" says Willerslev. \"But no one really knows \u2014 there are no reliable estimates of the maximum DNA survival time.\" \n             Visit our  \n             \n                 newsblog \n               \n              to read and post comments about this story. \n           \n                   PLoS Biology \n                 Reprints and Permissions"},

Half of all cases of male autism may be caused by spontaneous genetic mutations, say researchers who have studied the genetic patterns of the condition. Offspring who inherit such mutations are at a greater risk of having an autistic child themselves. Autistic people have difficulty relating socially with others and tend to focus obsessively on a narrow set of interests. Three to six out of every 1,000 people are expected to have the condition; its cause is unknown but there is thought to be a strong genetic component. \"That genetics plays a major role in autism has been obvious now for 20 years or more,\" says Isabelle Rapin, a neurologist at Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York, who was not affiliated with the study. \"The evidence for genetics is not controversial.\" But determining how genes affect autism has been difficult. Autism is a complex disease with a wide range of symptoms and severity. It also affects four times more males than females, for unknown reasons.  \n              Spontaneous mutation \n            Earlier this year, a genome-wide scan linked some cases of autism with mutations in the number of copies of certain genes. Ten per cent of autistic patients had copy-number mutations that were not present in either parent, showing that the mutations were spontaneous 1 .  But Michael Wigler, a geneticist at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in New York and a lead author on the study, says that the study probably missed some copy-number mutations. \"We were sure that 10% was an underestimate,\" he says. So Wigler and his colleagues turned to a database containing pedigrees of families with two or more autistic children and asked: if the family's first two children were autistic, what were the chances that the third was autistic as well? In 86 families with two autistic children and a third, male child, 42 of the third-born children showed autistic symptoms, the researchers report in  Proceedings of the National Academies of Sciences 2 .  This suggests that parents had a one-in-two chance of passing on a mutation to their offspring, matching a dominant inheritance pattern. Another database gave the same result.  \n              Handed down \n            Using mathematical models, Wigler's team found that the simplest way to describe the patterns of autism inheritance was to divide parents into two risk classes: those who carry a pre-existing autism-causing mutation, and those who do not. The models suggest that about half of autistic children are born to parents with no previous genetic predisposition to autism, suggesting that the cases are caused by spontaneous mutations.  Older mothers, who are more likely to have autistic children, could fall into this class, notes Wigler. Such mothers' eggs have had more time to accumulate mutations.   Once those spontaneous mutations have been passed on, the offspring \u2014 particularly women, who can carry the mutation without showing symptoms \u2014 have a high risk of having an autistic child. Males with the mutation would also bear this risk, but are also likely to be autistic and therefore less likely to have children.  The researchers' model suggested that about a quarter of autistic children have inherited a copy-number mutation from their parents. \"It's a new way of looking at the data,\" says Rapin. Future studies using data from other family members are needed to further test the new models, she says. Other factors, such as complications during pregnancy, and the influence of multiple genes, may also be important in causing autism.  \n             Visit our  \n             \n                 newsblog \n               \n              to read and post comments about this story. \n           \n                   Nature Neuroscience Gateway \n                 \n                   Nature Genetics blog \n                 \n                   CDC Autism Spectrum Disorders page \n                 \n                   Autism Genetic Resource Exchange \n                 \n                   Interactive Autism Network \n                 Reprints and Permissions"},

Three years ago, a 44-year-old man was admitted to hospital in Marseille, France, complaining of weakness in his left leg. He had no idea what doctors would find to be the source of the problem: a huge pocket of fluid where most of his brain ought to be.  Normally, fluid continuously circulates throughout the brain and is drained away into the circulatory system. But in this case, the man's drainage tubes had narrowed, resulting in an accumulation of fluid in the ventricles and an enlargement of the skull due to the great volume of fluid pressing against it. This had squeezed his brain into a narrow layer around the outside of the fluid, doctors report in the  Lancet 1  today. \"We were very surprised when we looked for the first time the CT scan,\" says Lionel Feuillet, a neurologist at the Mediterranean University, Marseille. \"The brain was very, very much smaller than normal.\" Nevertheless, subsequent tests showed the man to have an IQ of 75 \u2014 at the lower end of the 'normal range'.  The patient was a married father with two children and a job as a civil servant. His problems with his left leg were a neurological symptom of the condition, says Feuillet.  \n              Water on the brain \n            The general condition caused by a build-up of fluid in the brain's ventricles \u2014 called hydrocephalus or 'water on the brain' \u2014 is relatively common, affecting about one in 1,000 people. It is most common in children but can affect adults too.  To release the trapped fluid doctors insert a tube called a 'shunt', allowing it to drain into the bloodstream and central nervous system. With this treatment most patients lead a fairly normal life. But neurological problems and other complications, such as brain infection and problems related to the shunt, are not uncommon. Left untreated, the condition is often fatal. It's likely that the man in this case had hydrocephalus from birth, says Feuillet. His medical records show that he was treated with a shunt at the age of 6 months, and again at 14 years old. But without further neurological problems the extent of his condition went un-noticed for decades. The fact that his medical record shows normal neurological development is remarkable, says Feuillet. \"This case is unique to our knowledge. We have never encountered such severe hydrocephalus before.\"   Many other medical conditions lead to brain shrinkage, including brain atrophy from Alzheimer's disease, explains Feuillet. \"But in these cases, mental abilities are usually affected.\" For example, people with microcephaly \u2014 a condition in which the size of the head and brain is reduced (but the structure of the brain is normal) \u2014 can suffer from cerebral palsy, epilepsy, impaired vision and hearing, and autism.  Happily, this patient has made a complete recovery following his treatment, reports Feuillet, although a subsequent scan showed no change in his brain size. So the man with the tiny brain lives on. \n             Visit our  \n             \n                 newsblog \n               \n              to read and post comments about this story. \n           \n                   The Hydrocephalus Association \n                 Reprints and Permissions"},

After bouncing shampoo, physicists now bring you bouncing cooking oil. A team in Texas has found that the trampolining of a liquid jet falling onto a bath of the same liquid is more common than expected. Last year, a group in the Netherlands studied this bouncing effect for a jet of shampoo (see ' Puzzle of leaping liquid solved '). The bounce, which was first reported more than 40 years ago, happens because of the peculiar nature of shampoo, which gets thinner (less viscous) as it flows. A jet of it hitting a liquid surface is therefore lubricated by a thin layer at the interface, enabling it to bounce off rather than merge. But the liquids now studied by Matthew Thrasher and his colleagues at the University of Texas in Austin don't have this property. The silicone oils in their experiment are viscous but have 'normal' flow behaviour, like water 1 . The researchers directed a jet of oil vertically onto the surface of a tank of the same oil. They found that the jet could undergo both a 'leaping' rebound and a bizarre 'flat' bounce in which it sprang horizontally across the liquid surface.  The bounce here is due to a thin layer of air that separates the two liquid surfaces, the researchers say in an article submitted to  Physical Review E . They point out that the effect can easily be recreated in a kitchen experiment with cooking oil. Just fill a glass pie dish with about 4 centimetres of oil and pour onto it a thin stream from a cup about 3 to 6 centimetres above the surface. While pouring, move the stream in a circle about once every 2 seconds (or perhaps less messily rotate the dish on a Lazy Susan). The bounce can be encouraged by passing a chopstick or some other small rod through the stream every now and then.  \n             Visit our  \n             \n                 newsblog \n               \n              to read and post comments about this story. \n           \n                   Preprint of paper \n                 \n                   Matthew Thrasher\u2019s website \n                 \n                   Nonlinear dynamics at the University of Texas at Austin \n                 \n                   Bouncing shampoo \n                 Reprints and Permissions"},

Members of an influential parliamentary committee, which serves as a watchdog on UK science policy, are protesting over a planned government reorganization that they fear would subsume it into a larger committee. Under the plans, the Select Committee on Science and Technology would become part of the newly created Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills, which is responsible for science now that Gordon Brown is prime minister (see  Nature   448 , 7; 2007). Members worry that the new committee would be mainly concerned with university administration. The science select committee, consisting of members of the three main political parties, is well known for overseeing the government's policy on issues ranging from illegal drugs to the proposed national identity-card scheme. Earlier this year, it also successfully campaigned to overturn the government's proposed ban on hybrid embryo research. Given the current high public profile of science, now is \u201cthe wrong time to downgrade or reduce the scrutiny of cross-cutting science issues within parliament\u201d, committee chair Phil Willis wrote in a letter to Geoff Hoon, the government's chief whip. \u201cThe strong view amongst the science community is that such scrutiny is best carried out by a select committee with a clear identity and a clear mission.\u201d Another committee member, Evan Harris, added: \u201cThe problem is that a committee that covers universities and skills is not going to have time to scrutinize science across the government.\u201d It would be preferable, he says, for a dedicated, independent science committee to continue with the remit of the current one. Harris raised the possibility in parliamentary questions on 12 July. House of Commons leader Harriet Harman replied that \u201cdiscussions are ongoing\u201d. Harris told  Nature  that the committee's ideal position would be to remain as an independent entity, rather than become a subcommittee within the new department. Critics of the government's reshuffle have pointed out that the new department, although responsible for overseeing science, does not even feature the word 'science' in its title. \u201cIt's a pity that the name 'science' has been lost because it will reduce its profile. That's the danger,\u201d says Harris. Previously, scientific research came under the remit of the Office of Science and Innovation, within the Department of Trade and Industry.

Pluto's neighbouring object, Charon, could be spewing out liquid water from ultra-cold volcanoes, covering Charon's chilly surface with freshly-formed ice crystals. This dramatic conclusion was made by Jason Cook at Arizona State University, Tempe, who looked at Charon's near-infrared spectrum using telescopes at the Gemini Observatory at Mauna Kea, Hawaii. Cook found traces of both crystalline water ice and ammonia, he reports in  Astrophysical Journal 1 . Cook says that icy crystals can only exist on Charon if they are regularly deposited there. Crystalline ice cannot exist for long on the surface because it is bombarded with ultra-violet radiation from the Sun and charged particles, and these smooth out the crystals, he says. This is where the volcanoes come in. Cook speculates that liquid water deep within Charon's core is mixed with ammonia, which acts like antifreeze and lowers the freezing point. Volcanoes could then belch out this water, which would immediately freeze and snow back down onto the surface of Charon as crystals of ice and the ammonia hydrates that Cook detects in his spectra. \"We looked at several processes; none worked except cryovolcanism,\" says Cook.  \n              Kicked up \n            It's great to pin down which substances are on Charon's surface, says William McKinnon, an expert on icy satellites from Washington University, St Louis. But he thinks that there could be alternative explanations for the ice, other than 'cryovolcanoes'. He suggests that the core may stay liquid not because of the presence of ammonia (it is unlikely that Charon is rich enough in ammonia for that, he says), but by a porous outer layer of icy rock that insulates the interior from the chilly exterior.   And Charon's surface is churned up by asteroid impacts as a matter of course and this could be enough to kick up crystals on the surface, he says. The New Horizons mission to the Kuiper belt \u2014 a ring of comets in the outer reaches of the Solar System beyond Pluto \u2014 should solve the conundrum once and for all.

A protein known to keep cancer at bay now also looks to be a fountain of youth. Mice with an extra copy of the tumour-killing gene that pumps out this protein live longer than those with just one copy, and are better at combating the cell damage that causes ageing. The finding hints that a drug designed to boost the tumour suppressor, called p53, could work as an anti-ageing treatment for people, says Manuel Serrano, a biologist at Spanish National Cancer Research Centre in Madrid. Serrano's team publish their work in this week's  Nature 1 . The conclusion seems to stand in direct contradiction to previous work 2 , which showed that a boost in p53 kept mice cancer free but also caused them to age more quickly. But there's a key difference between these studies, the researchers say: in the new work, the normal regulatory mechanisms remain in place, so p53 is churned out only when needed. This seems to turn an ageing protein into a youth-preserving one. \"It's a very impressive effect,\" says Larry Donehower of Baylor University in Houston, who led the older work. \"It's very hopeful because it says under some circumstances you can get the best of both worlds.\"  \n              Double duty \n            First discovered in a 1979 study of tumour-causing viruses, p53 is one of the world's most researched proteins, with tens of thousands of papers written about it so far. When triggered by DNA damage or other stressors, p53 instructs cells to commit suicide or to stop dividing \u2014 nipping cancers in the bud. Researchers have now discovered that the protein also uses a gentler strategy to keep us healthy \u2014 it turns on cellular production of antioxidants, which mop up damaging molecules. To determine whether this subtler role of p53 could slow ageing, Serrano's lab bred mice with an extra copy of  p53 , along with the usual gene that helps to regulate how much protein it produces. These mice produce more p53 protein when prompted to by cellular stress, such as DNA damage or lack of oxygen. As expected, mice with the extra copy of p53 had fewer tumours than regular mice, and their cells were less likely to turn cancerous when grown in a Petri dish. On average, the transgenic mice lived 16% longer than normal mice: 118 days versus 137. By comparison, mice on a calorie-restricted diet \u2014 another lifespan booster \u2014 get a 20% bump in life expectancy. But the age boost wasn't just an effect of fewer mice dying of cancer. When the researchers looked only at cancer-free mice in the study, they found that these transgenic mice lived 25% longer, on average, than normal ones. The oldest mice in both groups died at about the same age, but more of the transgenic mice lived into their golden years than the normal ones. When the researchers looked more closely at the youthful mice, they found higher levels of genes that combat oxidative damage than in regular rodents. The mice with extra p53 also held up better against a lethal dose of paraquat, a drug that causes oxidative damage.  \n              Live long and prosper \n            Donehower's study in 2002 had indicated that high levels of p53 can cause mice to age faster, as an abundance of the protein seemed to curb the growth and repair of all sorts of cells \u2014 not just cancerous ones. But those mice had a mutation that caused the protein to always be activated, says Donehower. He says he is now convinced that an extra copy of the normal p53 gene can forestall ageing. So might patients some day pop a pill that fights cancer and keeps them young? \"That's the million dollar question,\" Serrano says. Several cancer drugs targeting p53 are in clinical trials. His lab is testing one of them in mice. If this study is any indication, the key will be to find a drug that doesn't let p53 run amuck. \n             Visit our  \n             \n                 newsblog \n               \n              to read and post comments about this story. \n           \n                   Nature ageing insight \n                 \n                   National Institute on Aging \n                 Reprints and Permissions"},

Moscow In what could be the biggest windfall for science since the collapse of the Soviet Union, the Russian parliament last week gave the green light to a massive US$7-billion investment in nanotechnology over five years. The Russian government hopes the programme will make the country a world leader in nanoscale technologies with a wide range of military and civilian uses. However, the move has been criticized as poorly prepared and unlikely to yield results. Nano-devices, designed from single atoms and molecules, are predicted to have applications in fields as diverse as consumer electronics and biomedicine. All research and development activities will be coordinated by Rosnanotekh, a new tax-exempt body with far-reaching freedom to set up institutes, put work out to tender and commercialize results. But no details have been announced about the precise structure, goals and content of the initiative. It is unclear, for example, how projects will be selected for funding. Some Russian scientists, sceptical about fair allocation of funds, have given the announcement a lukewarm response. The country has hardly any competence in nanotechnology, they say. And given the widespread absence of efficient quality control in Russian science funding, many fear the scheme will be poisoned by corruption. \u201cOur government just doesn't understand anything about science,\u201d says one high-level Russian physicist who asked not to be named. \u201cThey think if they throw enough money at it they'll get some nice exploitable results in return. But we don't even have the experts.\u201d The programme is the brainchild of Russian President Vladimir Putin, who is keen to reduce the country's dependence on oil and gas. Putin recently compared the importance of nanotechnology to that of nuclear science. He is said to have secretly recruited Mikhail Kovalchuk, the director the Kurchatov Institute in Moscow, to head Rosnanotekh. Kovalchuk, who is not an expert in nanotechnology, is the brother of Yuri Kovalchuk, a banker and businessman with close ties to Putin. The independent Russian media has poured scorn on Russia's foray into what some call the \u201cbanano\u201d technology business. \u201cLack of transparency and programme abuse for personal goals are the usual Russian dangers,\u201d says former science minister Boris Saltykov, an expert in science management. \u201cRisks do exist,\u201d agrees Alexander Nekipelov, vice-president of the Russian Academy of Sciences in Moscow. \u201cBut the money involved is so huge that scrutiny will be very good this time.\u201d The academy is keen not to be bypassed by the programme, for which the government has set aside more funds than the entire academy receives. In a move that critics say violates its own rules, in June the academy leadership appointed Kovalchuk, who is not a full member, as acting vice-president for nanotechnology. \n                     Guilty, but no jail sentence for Russian scientist \n                   \n                     Russians fear privatization of state labs \n                   \n                     Russia's prize fighter \n                   \n                     Russian Academy of Sciences \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Long-time world checkers champion Marion Tinsley consistently bested all comers, losing only nine games in the 40 years following his 1954 crowning. He lost his world championship title to a computer program in 1994 and now that same program has become unbeatable; its creators have proved that even a perfectly played game against it will end in a draw. Jonathan Schaeffer and his team at the University of Alberta, Canada, have been working on their program, called Chinook, since 1989, running calculations on as many as 200 computers simultaneously. Schaeffer has now announced that they have solved the game of American checkers, which is played on an 8 by 8 board and is also known as English draughts. The team directed Chinook so it didn't have to go through every one of the 500 billion billion (5 * 10 20 ) possible moves. Not all losing plays needed to be analysed; instead, for each game position, Chinook needed to work out only a move that would allow it to win. In the end, only 1/5,000,000 of the moves were computed. As Chinook has worked out all relevant lines of play, it needs virtually no time to 'think' to work out each perfect move in a game. The results were announced today in the journal  Science 1 . The paper and supporting materials, including the ability to play Chinook, are available on the web at http://www.cs.ualberta.ca/~chinook/.  Jaap van den Herik, editor of the  International Computer Games Journal , calls the achievement \"a truly significant advance in artificial intelligence\".  \n              Un-trivial pursuit \n           The solvability of a board game generally depends on two factors: the number of possible positions, or 'state-space complexity', and the difficulty of deciding on the best move, or 'decision complexity'. Tic-tac-toe is simple on both counts \u2014 simple enough to be figured out by children. Checkers, says van den Herik, is complex in both regards (see ' How hard is your game '). Chess is even harder to solve than checkers, with a state-space complexity of 10 46 . Decision complexity is difficult to quantify, but it is clearly high for chess. Van den Herik thinks that chess will be solved \"not within our lives, but within the lives of our children \u2014 I would say between 2060 and 2070\".  \"Twenty years ago, we thought chess was as an infinite game,\" notes van den Herik. \"But the proof of Schaeffer is one more signpost that we are approaching the solution.\" But Schaeffer says new tools are needed before that will happen. \"Chess and Go cannot be solved with the type of technology that we have today,\" he says. The game of Go, as played on a 19 by 19 grid, is often considered to be the hardest popular game to crack, with something like 10 100  possible positions.  \n              Game of Life  \n            Schaeffer notes that his research has implications beyond the checkers board. The same algorithms his team writes to solve games could be helpful in searching other databases, such as vast lists of biological information because, as he says, \"At the core, they both reduce to the same fundamental problem: large, compressed data sets that have to be accessed quickly.\"  Competitive checkers players seem appreciative of Schaeffer's work, rather than being depressed by the news. \"People will keep right on playing checkers,\" says Bob Newell, editor of the world's most-read checker publication  The Checker Maven . Ed Trice, designer of a chess variant named Gothic Chess and checkers expert (having won against some world champions), says that tournament players are likely to feel \"literally no negative impact to the announcement\".

Crustaceans need to moult their exoskeletons throughout their lives so they can grow. As the time for a moult nears, a new exoskeleton starts to form beneath the old one. To soften the old exoskeleton and make the shedding process easier, calcium is reabsorbed in the days before the moult. Once the new exoskeleton is in place and the old one gone, calcium that was absorbed from the old exoskeleton is shifted to the new one to harden it. Marine biologists have long understood this process of calcium control. But they have only just started to realize how moulting might affect the distribution of other elements, such as trace metals. These can be toxic in excess and cause numerous health problems, such as disrupting reproduction, slowing limb regeneration and changing body colour. Copper, zinc and lead have all been found in the exoskeleton, leading some researchers to speculate that crustaceans shed their shells to rid their bodies of too much metal.  \n              Full metal jacket \n            To check, Lauren Bergey and Judith Weis at Rutgers University in Newark, New Jersey, obtained fiddler crabs ( Minuca pugnax ) from two very different populations. One was from Linden, New Jersey, in a site adjacent to a sewage treatment plant and a highway and surrounded by industrial facilities. The other lived in the New Jersey Jacques Cousteau National Estuarine Research Reserve.  The team found that fiddler crabs could indeed manage their metals. Both populations shifted copper and zinc from the exoskeleton back into soft tissues just before the moult, but in the polluted population the moult served to rid the crabs of excess lead. \"What I found really impressive was how much lead shedding we were seeing in polluted waters,\" says Bergey. Some crabs released 76% of their body's lead content in a single moult. The results will be published in an upcoming issue of the journal of  Marine Environmental Research 1 .  Shifting around this much metal is probably bad for the crab. The long-term energy costs are unclear, but they are almost certainly less than the penalties of metal poisoning.  \"We need to consider looking at moulting in a new light,\" says Bergey. Some researchers studying crustaceans response to metals have watched the creatures over only a short period of time. But this work on moulting shows that exposure to metals should be studied over the long-term, to capture the effect of shell shedding on dealing with pollution.  \n             Visit our  \n             \n                 newsblog \n               \n              to read and post comments about this story. \n           \n                   The fate and Effect of Toxic Metals in Aquatic Food Webs \n                 \n                   Crustacea.net \n                 \n                   How toxic are heavy metals to estuary life? \n                 Reprints and Permissions"},

Honeybee queens produce a chemical cocktail that politicians would swarm to get their hands on: the scent of a queen keeps her drones and workers loyal to the throne, dutifully feeding and grooming their ruler.  Now it seems that this chemical perfume also prevents worker bees from developing aversions. This means that undergoing a negative experience around a queen won't lead a worker bee to learn to hate her. \"They can still respond to something nasty,\" says entomologist Alison Mercer of the University of Otago in Dunedin, New Zealand. \"But what they can't do is learn to associate particular stimuli with nasty outcomes.\"  \n              Negative association \n            Mercer and her colleagues tested this by training bees to associate a particular smell (not from the queen) with a mild electrical shock. They strapped the bees down, released the odour, and administered the shock. The bees extended their stingers in response to the jolt. After a few repetitions of scent and shock, the smell alone was enough to trigger the stinger reflex even without a jolt of electricity \u2014 so long as the bees didn't scent their queen.  Bees exposed to the queen's pheromones, and specifically to a compound called homovanillyl alcohol (HVA), did not learn to associate the smell with the shock. They could, however, still learn to associate a particular smell with food, showing that HVA was acting specifically on aversion rather than general learning or physical responsiveness. The results are published this week in  Science . Previous work had shown that HVA acts on the bee brain via a signalling molecule called dopamine. In humans, dopamine plays a role in motor control and reward-seeking behaviour. In insects, however, dopamine is responsible for motor control and aversion. A different chemical, called octopamine, mediates positive associations, which could explain why HVA did not affect responses to food.  \n              Smells like queen spirit \n            HVA is just one of many compounds within the queen mandibular pheromone coating the queen's body. The queen's attendant workers groom her with their proboscises and by rubbing her with their antennae. Then, when they mix with the rest of the hive, they distribute her pheromones to other bees. This calms the crowd and prevents reproduction among worker bees. \"As soon as you put a queen into a colony, the young workers are less active and less aggressive,\" says Mercer.  So why would a queen need to chemically prevent the workers from learning to hate her? One possibility, suggests Mercer, is that the queens may have a problem with body odour: in high concentrations, their heady mix of pheromones become repellent.  \"You can overdo any odorant,\" says Mercer. \"We experience that in humans, too.\" If worker bees, particularly those closest to the queen, were to get a whiff of that stench too many times, they may begin to avoid her. And that could spell the end of the queen.  Entomologist Mark Winston of Simon Fraser University in Vancouver, Canada, says the study provides an exciting glimpse into the relationship between genes and behaviour, but he finds the 'stinky queen' explanation unlikely. \"I doubt that pheromone concentrations ever get high enough in a colony to be repellent,\" he says. But he says suppressing aversion may still be important for other bee activities.  \n             Visit our  \n             \n                 newsblog \n               \n              to read and post comments about this story. \n           Reprints and Permissions"},

The island that is now England, Scotland and Wales was severed from continental Europe by a cataclysmic flood during the last ice age, according to a group of researchers based in Britain. The team, led by Sanjeev Gupta, a geologist at Imperial College London, have found strong evidence at the bottom of the English Channel for a 'super-flood' theory first suggested more than 20 years ago 1 . At that time, the idea that the Dover Strait \u2014 the narrow seaway that separates England and France \u2014 was created by a massive surge was widely ignored because of lack of solid geological evidence. That has now changed. Gupta and his team first came across the old speculations by chance. They were fascinated by the idea, and realised that today's technology would allow them to look for geological traces of megafloods at the seafloor. Gupta and his colleagues used data from the UK Hydrographic Office, collected for the purpose of ensuring safe navigation, to map the sea floor with this idea in mind. More recent data was collected by ships equipped with GPS and high-resolution acoustic measurement devices. Their survey reveals several distinctive features typical of large-scale flood flows, the team reports in  Nature  today 2 . The straight shape of the wide underwater valley, a floor grooved and gouged as if by flowing water and tumbling rock, and streamlined 'islands' of raised sea-floor between deeper channels all bear striking resemblance to landforms sculpted some 15,000 years ago by the Lake Missoula flood in the northwestern United States. Similar landforms on Mars are also thought to have been formed by large floods. Such floods are extremely rare, and although their energy is huge, geological records of their impact are subtle. \"We couldn't have identified it [as a flood] without these analogies,\" says Gupta.  \n              Over the top \n           Hundreds of thousands of years ago, a ridge of chalk rock stretched from England to France, roughly between Dover and Calais. To the northeast of this ridge, melting ice and rivers fed a huge glacial lake, blocked in the north by a wall of ice, which was the primeval start of today's North Sea. To the southwest, Britain was connected to Europe by low-lying land. At some point, the rising waters of the North Sea lake must have over-topped the ridge, creating a massive waterfall down to the southwest. A first flood probably occurred around 425,000 years ago, the team proposes, as other evidence points to the existence of a North Sea lake at that time. The flow must have quickly become torrential, with perhaps as much as a million cubic metres of water per second being discharged over the cliff face and gouging out the Dover Strait. \"I had previously thought the overspill would have been much more organized, more like a river than a deluge,\" says Philip Gibbard, a quaternary geologist at Cambridge University, UK. \"But the assemblage of new observations is fully convincing. It will be very difficult to counter the evidence.\"  \n              Birth of an island \n            A second spill is likely to have occurred some 200,000 years later, during the most recent ice age, when again ice would have blocked up the north and created a lake where today's North Sea lies. This flood was probably even more powerful than the first one, enlarging the Dover Strait to almost its present size. From then on, Britain would have been an island, only intermittently connected to the continent during times of extremely low sea level. \"They make a really strong case,\" says Victor Baker, a hydrologist at the University of Arizona in Tucson, adding that the complex issue of timing the events is the main caveat of the otherwise convincing study.  Gupta says theirs was only a \"first-hand study\", with a lot of additional work, on precise timing, location and discharge rates of the floods, still to be done. The impact of the deluge on early human colonization of Britain, and on ocean currents in the Atlantic, is also unclear. Dangerous floods are commonly associated with glaciation. But the surge of the English Channel was massively larger in size and impact than floods that occur fairly frequently in places such as the Himalayas today. \"This was perhaps the biggest flood on Earth we have evidence for,\" says Gibbard.  \n             Visit our  \n             \n                 newsblog \n               \n              to read and post comments about this story. \n           \n                   NOVA Mystery of the Megaflood \n                 \n                   University of Cambridge Quaternary Group \n                 Reprints and Permissions"},

Protecting nature within the context of human activity is a complicated thing to do; and it can be even harder to convince people to do it. One way that people try to make sure that nature is protected is through 'mainstreaming' \u2014 integrating ecological goals into the practices of businesses and governments. Nature 's Emma Marris sat down with two people who are trying this in South Africa. Trevor Sandwith is coordinator of Cape Action for People and the Environment (CAPE), a programme endorsed by the South African government, and deputy chair of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) World Commission on Protected Areas. Mandy Driver works on policy and planning for the South African National Biodiversity Institute.  \n              EM: What is 'mainstreaming', and where did the term originate? \n           TS: The term comes from the Convention on Biological Diversity, back in 1992, which required parties to mainstream biodiversity into policies and programmes. MD: In this context, it is mainstreaming biodiversity priorities or considerations into sectors whose core business is not biodiversity.  TS: Ultimately, mainstreaming means that sectors recognize the value of biodiversity, but not simply as an add-on \u2014 as one might \"respect human rights\" or \"respect biodiversity\" \u2014 but actually incorporate into their business practices a respect for biodiversity, or actually run their business dependent on biodiversity.  MD: Or get some set-asides \u2014 actual hectares conserved on the ground.  \n              EM: So how do you convince a mining company that it is in their business interest to do this? \n           MD: It can be tricky. It depends partly on how much it affects their costs and bottom line. It's relatively easy for a mining company (or any company) to talk about incorporating biodiversity in their operations, but when it comes down to finding a rich deposit of a lucrative mineral on the last remaining patch of a particular ecosystem type, which doesn't exist anywhere else, what happens then? That's the real test.  \n              EM: So how about somehow making that destruction cost something - making that 'precious' ecosystem actually monetarily precious? \n            MD: Right, that's mainstreaming into fiscal policy. One big area that we deal with is mainstreaming biodiversity in regulatory systems, especially in the public sector, especially around land-use planning and environmental impact assessments.  \n              EM: So if you can't mainstream the industry, you can mainstream the regulators.  \n            TS: Right. You start with things that are highly dependent on biodiversity \u2014 the easiest opportunities. So, forestry, agriculture, tourism. We've dealt with these regulatory sectors a lot. We have had success by lowering the cost to the regulators of incorporating biodiversity considerations. We provide good information so that they don't have to go out and pay a lot of money for it. MD: An example is maps we made of critically endangered areas in the Eastern Cape for land-use planners.  \n              EM: Do you have any success stories? \n            TS: We have this biodiversity and wine initiative in CAPE. It is a real natural, because the wines have unique origins in various estates, they have terroir. And what we are going to bring to the table now are wines produced in a landscape that is conserved. The wines can be marketed internationally with the slogan \"Variety is in our Nature\". In South Africa, rhinos are increasing in number at virtually their biological potential. Why? They are sold. You pay half a million Rand [US$70,000] for a group of rhinos on auction [for wildlife reserves, tourism and limited trophy hunting], resulting in people converting unproductive cattle-farms into sanctuaries for wildlife. As a result, there are more rhinos in the world today.  \n              EM: Is it easier to enact policies such as this in South Africa than elsewhere? \n            TS: We have a huge opportunity because of the generally low level of development. Think about a country like Bangladesh, with 150 million people in a tiny space. What is the chance of mainstreaming biodiversity there? You may need a substantial resource of biodiversity to start with to even try it.  Mainstreaming works well in a revolutionary policy environment, such as South Africa, where everyone recognizes that the past has been inequitable and unjust and that we need to do things differently. South Africa has a bill of rights, and one of those rights is to an environment that is not detrimental to your health or wellbeing. When you open your mouth and start talking to a mining company, you can say, \"Listen, to operate in our new democratic society...\" There are frightening things about our society in South Africa. But there is also a great humanity and a collective mobilization of people. The struggle for democracy had a huge groundswell and huge spirit \u2014 not self-seeking but for the good of all. I would like to think that we could get some of that behind biodiversity. \n             Visit our  \n             \n                 newsblog \n               \n              to read and post comments about this story. \n           \n                   Conservation biology conference blog \n                 \n                   Biodiversity and Wine Initiative \n                 Reprints and Permissions"},

In the world of underground science, space is tight, and getting tighter. So scientists across the globe are welcoming a proposal for a new US facility that could help relieve the growing subterranean real-estate crisis. On 10 July, the US National Science Foundation (NSF) announced that it had selected the abandoned Homestake gold mine near Lead, South Dakota, as the preferred site for a US$500-million Deep Underground Science and Engineering Laboratory. If fully funded, the mine will be developed into a sprawling underground campus \u2014 the deepest yet \u2014 where geologists, microbiologists and physicists can ply their trade. It is physicists in particular who want the space, and who have been driving the push for the new lab. For decades, they have travelled to road tunnels and abandoned mines to build experiments that must be shielded from cosmic radiation. Only a handful of locations can host the searches, and many are becoming overcrowded, says Eugenio Coccia, director of the world's largest underground facility, the 180,000-cubic-metre Gran Sasso National Laboratory near L'Aquila, Italy. \u201cThere is no more empty space,\u201d he says. In the United States, the situation is even worse, says Bernard Sadoulet, a physicist at the University of California, Berkeley. America's only major underground facility is at the Soudan mine in Minnesota, and Sadoulet, who co-chaired a review of underground science for the NSF, says his committee received around 80 letters of interest in the new lab. Then there is the problem of depth: the Soudan mine is 710 metres deep, but most of the newer experiments need to go deeper. Sadoulet's own experiment at Soudan probes dark matter \u2014 particles that interact only rarely but make up roughly a quarter of the mass of the Universe (see  page 240 ). He says the next generation will be ready before Homestake and will be sited at the 2,070-metre-deep Sudbury Underground Laboratory in Ontario, Canada. Such physics is being driven ever deeper underground. As particle accelerators increase in size and cost, rare-event physics of the sort that can be done only beneath thousands of metres of rock is seen as an increasingly attractive means of probing big questions. For instance, a phenomenon known as neutrinoless double-beta decay, an extremely rare event that occurs during the decays of some nuclei, could prove that neutrinos are their own antiparticle. Such a finding would have implications for the standard model of particle physics, and could explain why there is more matter than antimatter in the Universe today. The search for these rare processes typically requires that detectors sit for years gathering just a handful of events. With each generation, the detectors get bigger and the experiments get longer. Thus, many existing underground laboratories are planning expansions. Proposals are on the table to expand the Fr\u00e9jus laboratory in France in 2012, says Gilles Gerbier, a physicist at the French Atomic Energy Commission in Saclay. And the Kamioka Observatory in Japan, which hosts the massive Super-Kamiokande neutrino detector, is also digging new spaces for a dark-matter search and double-beta-decay experiment, according to Yoichiro Suzuki, the observatory's director. The need for increased sensitivity of such experiments also sends them deeper, because each successive metre of rock gives more effective shielding from disruptive cosmic rays. The world's two deepest laboratories, Mont Blanc in France and the Sudbury mine in Canada (see graphic), are cramped. Even after an expansion at Sudbury planned for completion by 2008, there will be room for only four large experiments, says Arthur McDonald, a physicist at Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario. \u201cWe've had more letters of interest than we've space to house the experiments,\u201d he says. Homestake would also provide opportunities for geologists and microbiologists. Geologists could use it to study how rock behaves under pressure; such information may help to understand earthquakes. Meanwhile, microbiologists see the lab as an opportunity to study organisms that live far beneath Earth's surface. \u201cMost of these organisms don't depend on oxygen to survive,\u201d says Tullis Onstott, a geomicrobiologist at Princeton University in New Jersey. What nutrients they need, and how they obtain them, could provide clues to how life began, he adds. If approved, the Homestake lab will have campuses at 1,500 and 2,250 metres below the surface, with cavities 50\u201360 metres in diameter. That would be big enough to handle detectors for the most ambitious searches, says Kevin Lesko, head of the Homestake collaboration and a physicist at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California. \u201cI'm very excited,\u201d he adds. The selection of Homestake caps a long and highly politicized process. It was first put forward as a candidate in 2001, quickly winning the backing of powerful local politicians such as Senator Tom Daschle, who was then Democratic minority leader. In 2005, the NSF announced that Homestake and a Colorado mine were the finalists for hosting the underground lab, but protests from losing teams caused the process to be reopened. Even now, there is no guarantee that the Homestake lab will be built. Local billionaire T. Denny Sanford, together with the state of South Dakota, have pledged some $100 million for an interim site at 1,500 metres, but the deeper facility will require NSF construction money. At present, the agency has approved just $15 million for a three-year, detailed design study. To win full funding, the design must go before the independent National Science Board, where it will compete with other large projects. Even so, researchers are pleased that the first steps have been taken, and are hopeful that the lab will be built. \u201cIt's clear where the science is going,\u201d says Sadoulet. \u201cThe frontier is deep.\u201d \n                     Underground lab set for South Dakota \n                   \n                     Pumping row erodes hopes for underground lab \n                   \n                     Gold-mine conversion eases closer \n                   \n                     'Mile-deep club' of researchers sets sights on disused gold mine \n                   \n                     Legal move could open door to physics lab \n                   \n                     Deep Underground Science \n                   \n                     Sanford Laboratory Website \n                   \n                     More on double-beta decay \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Uptake of the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine plummeted in Britain after doctor and researcher Andrew Wakefield suggested in 1998 that it could be linked to autism \u2014 a suggestion that made huge waves in the media and with the public. Subsequent studies have ruled out a link between MMR and autism, and the majority of medical opinion now firmly rejects Wakefield's hypothesis. This week, Wakefield stands before a hearing at the General Medical Council (GMC) \u2014 the body that regulates doctors in the United Kingdom.  \n              Who is being charged with what? \n            The GMC panel is looking into allegations of serious professional misconduct against Wakefield and two colleagues, John Walker-Smith and Simon Murch. Reading of the full charges against them on Monday, at the start of the hearing, took more than an hour. Amongst these allegations is that they undertook research without \"proper ethical approval\". Wakefield and Walker-Smith are also alleged to have acted against the interests of children taking part in a study published in  The Lancet 1  (the paper that spurred Wakefield to suggest a link between MMR and autism) by administering a \"purportedly therapeutic substance\" to one child before obtaining information about the safety of the substance. In addition, Wakefield allegedly failed to disclose to the ethics committee approving his work that he was being paid to advise solicitors involved in MMR litigation. Perhaps the most eye-catching allegation the GMC lists is that \"Wakefield acted unethically and abused his position of trust as a medical practitioner by taking blood from children at a birthday party to use for research purposes without ethics committee approval, in an inappropriate social setting, and whilst offering financial inducement\". Wakefield has denied the overall charge of professional misconduct; all three will put forward their views over the course of the hearing.  Nature  was unable to contact Wakefield before going to press.  \n              How does all that relate to the MMR scare? \n            Only indirectly. Many of the charges against the three relate to research presented in the controversial  Lancet  paper, on which all were authors. But the GMC is not looking at the evidence for a link between MMR and autism, nor addressing that question. Nevertheless the hearing has again given further publicity to those who claim a link. The first meeting of the GMC panel saw protesters supporting Wakefield camped outside.  \n              How long will it take? \n            The hearing is scheduled to run until 19 October this year. That's a lot longer than most GMC cases, but the council says this is \"not unheard of\". If cleared of any wrongdoing by the panel, Wakefield and his co-defendants will in theory be free to practise as doctors. If the panel finds against them it will have a number of options. It could prevent them working again as doctors, either by erasing their names from the medical register or suspending them for a set period of time. Or it could place restrictions on their ability to practise medicine \u2014 such as requiring them to be supervised.  \n              If the panel decides to strike Wakefield off the medical register, what would this mean for his research? \n            Technically the GMC panel will only look at Wakefield, Walker-Smith and Murch's work as doctors in the United Kingdom. However, if they decide that they should be struck off (which is by no means certain), their ability to access research funding is likely to be seriously curtailed.  The UK Medical Research Council says it has never had a grant application from anyone who has been struck off the medical register and that it would be very difficult for such people to apply, given that applicants have to be from a hospital or academic institution. The UK Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council takes a similar view, adding that a researcher who could not work with human subjects might be able to do bench work. But Wakefield has a loyal group of supporters and he could decide to undertake private research. Wakefield's name has continued to appear on research papers about autism 2 , and he has a research position at the Thoughtful House Center for Children in Austin, Texas. \"This inquiry has no bearing on the vital and responsible research taking place at Thoughtful House or on Dr Wakefield's position here,\" says Anissa Ryland, director of operations for Thoughtful House. \"His work has been exemplary and our commitment to serving children with developmental disorders remains, and will remain, unchanged.\" \n             Visit our  \n             \n                 newsblog \n               \n              to read and post comments about this story. \n           \n                   Original Lancet paper \n                 \n                   General Medical Council \n                 Reprints and Permissions"},

Legislation to cut carbon emissions has traditionally received little support in corporate boardrooms and union halls, but this may soon change. Several large utility companies are among those backing a new proposal offered in the US Congress on 11 July by Senators Jeff Bingaman (Democrat, New Mexico) and Arlen Specter (Republican, Pennsylvania). The Bingaman\u2013Specter proposal is the latest of several major climate bills now under consideration by Congress (see  table ). Some observers see this one as setting the tone for a compromise package aiming to bring together competing interests to fight climate change. The 'Low Carbon Economy Act' would require the United States to reduce its carbon output to 2006 levels by 2020 and to 1990 levels by 2030. (The Kyoto Protocol on climate change, which the United States has not ratified, calls for cuts below 1990 levels by 2012.) Further reductions, to at least 60% below 2006 levels by 2050, are contingent upon cuts being made by other countries. Companies such as Duke Energy, one of the nation's largest utility suppliers, back the new bill because it includes a provision allowing carbon emitters to buy extra allowances at a set cost. This would provide a 'safety valve', ensuring a stable price for emissions, and keeping the companies' future costs at a foreseeable level. The bill also has the support of the union group AFL-CIO, which has traditionally challenged climate-control legislation on the grounds that it would drive jobs overseas, and key Republican legislators \u2014 such as Lisa Murkowski and Ted Stevens, both senators from Alaska \u2014 who have been sceptical of other climate proposals. \u201cThe other bills are more aggressive and less realistic,\u201d says Frank Maisano, a spokesman in Washington DC for Bracewell & Giuliani, a law firm representing many of the fossil-fuel industries. \u201cThey're all show and no go.\u201d But environmental advocates say that pricing extra allowances at a set cost will weaken the nascent American carbon market. \u201cI think it's unlikely to achieve absolute reduction if the safety valve undercuts the programme,\u201d says Vicki Arroyo, director of policy analysis at the Pew Center on Global Climate Change in Arlington, Virginia. \u201cIt's more like an escape hatch.\u201d Under the bill, 53% of carbon allowances would be handed out to utilities, manufacturers and other carbon-producing industries. From 2017 on, an increasing proportion of allowances would be auctioned off, generating billions of dollars for green technology and climate-change adaptation. The safety valve would start at $12 per tonne of carbon dioxide emitted, and would increase each year at 5% above inflation. The Bingaman\u2013Specter bill also packs in several features that don't appear in other proposed legislation, says Jonathan Pershing, a climate expert at the World Resources Institute, an environmental think-tank in Washington DC. It provides additional allowances for companies that invest in carbon capture and storage, and spells out how the government will divvy out carbon allowances, including a share for states to distribute. \u201cNone of the other bills has this,\u201d Pershing says. The major sticking point for environmental groups is the bill's safety valve. If the market price for carbon exceeds the safety valve, emitters can instead buy allowances \u2014 essentially a carbon tax. The cost of credits is likely to surpass the limit early on and disrupt the carbon market, says Arroyo. Such a feature would also complicate US participation in an international carbon-trading market. European governments are unlikely to allow companies to purchase American offsets directly, but a less formal link-up based on options trading could emerge, says Pershing. The European carbon market, which opened in 2005, has got off to a shaky start. Prices for a tonne of carbon plummeted from \u20ac31 (US$43) to \u20ac12 in April 2006, when leaked emissions data revealed that several nations hadn't used up their allotted credits. Jeff Holmstead, former head of the Environmental Protection Agency's Office of Air and Radiation and now also with Bracewell & Giuliani, says a safety valve is needed because technologies to make deep cuts in carbon emissions are not yet available. Larger questions about effects on the domestic economy and the likely migration of carbon-producing industries abroad mean climate legislation has no prospect of passing soon, Holmstead argues. He is confident that there will be insufficient votes supporting it in either the House of Representatives or the Senate \u201cuntil there's a much better understanding of what it will mean\u201d. Those pushing for a strong climate bill are more optimistic. Congress is likely to act soon, says Pershing, given the growing pressure from the US public to address global warming. \u201cThe question is not whether, but when,\u201d he says. A subcommittee led by Senators Joe Lieberman (Independent, Connecticut) and John Warner (Republican, Virginia) is expected to work out a compromise climate bill that is likely to reach the Senate floor in coming months. \n                     Western states launch carbon scheme \n                   \n                     Is the global carbon market working? \n                   \n                     Carbon copies \n                   \n                     Climate Change In Focus \n                   \n                     Low Carbon Economy Act \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Declan Butler traces the efforts of scientists to help establish the truth. Rich Roberts didn't realize what he was getting into last October, when he decided to mobilize his fellow Nobel laureates to draw attention to a death-penalty case in Libya. Six medical workers \u2014 five nurses from Bulgaria and a Palestinian doctor \u2014 were charged with deliberately infecting more than 400 children with the virus that causes AIDS. Roberts, like many scientists, was shocked at how scientific evidence exonerating the medical workers had been ignored, and decided to do something about it. For Roberts, a 1993 Nobel laureate in medicine or physiology, it was the start of a relentless commitment. Over the past nine months, he has had a string of meetings with top-level diplomats, and on 10 June he even flew to Libya for a late-night meeting at the Corinthian Hotel in Tripoli with Seif al-Islam Gaddafi, son of the Libyan leader Muammar al-Gaddafi, to try to help find a solution. Roberts has also spent endless hours gathering an eventual 120 signatures from Nobel laureates \u2014 a record \u2014 for an open letter to Muammar al-Gaddafi. \u201cA miscarriage of justice will take place without proper consideration of scientific evidence,\u201d warned the letter (see  Nature   444 , 146; 2006 ). And it called on \u201cthe appropriate authorities to take the necessary steps to permit such evidence to be used in this case\u201d. On 31 October, just days before it was published, Roberts hand-delivered the letter to Libya's ambassador to the United Nations, Attia Omar Mubarak. Their meeting in New York lasted an hour and a half. Mubarak was dismayed about the letter, arguing that the Islamic way was to try to negotiate a settlement between the accused and the injured. But, says Roberts, Mubarak did admit the possibility that the whole thing was an accident that had been seized on by prosecutors. As  Nature  went to press this week, Libya's Supreme Council of the Judicial Authority was expected to annul or commute the death sentences of the six medical workers, a verdict that had been upheld by the country's supreme court just days before. The saga's anticipated ending is the result of months of careful negotiating between diplomats, informed and helped along by the input and advocacy of leading scientists. Consideration of solid evidence is something the medical workers need badly. They were arrested in 1999, after an outbreak of HIV in more than 400 children at the Al-Fateh hospital in Benghazi; more than 50 of them have since died. The medical workers were initially charged with deliberately injecting the children as part of a plot by the US Central Intelligence Agency. Those charges were then dropped, with prosecutors now claiming that the medical workers used the children as guinea pigs to test a therapy in an illicit clinical trial. In the midst of such spy-novel overtones, scientists have worked to inject credible evidence into the case. For instance, Vittorio Colizzi, an AIDS researcher at Tor Vergata University in Rome, Italy, testified at the medical workers' first trial along with Luc Montagnier, whose group at the Pasteur Institute in Paris discovered HIV. The scientists presented evidence that the infections were accidental, the result of a lack of safety precautions at the hospital. Other researchers, including Luc Perrin of the Geneva University Hospital in Switzerland, had reached the same conclusions independently. But the court threw their arguments out, on the basis that an investigation by Libyan doctors had reached the opposite conclusion. For Colizzi, the stakes go beyond the death penalties. He fears that blaming the medical workers is part of wider denial of AIDS by Libya, which has a large population of migrant workers from sub-Saharan Africa who have HIV. Libya and many countries also need to face up to the problem of hospital-borne diseases and to introduce safe healthcare programmes, he adds. \n               United front \n             Last autumn, after an editorial in  Nature  called for activism (see  Nature   443 , 605\u2013606; doi:10.1038/443605b 2006  ), scientific and human-rights groups including the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the Federation of the European Academies of Medicine, and the New York Academy of Sciences renewed public appeals and letter-writing campaigns to politicians. Robert Gallo, an HIV expert at the University of Maryland in Baltimore, and 43 other leading international researchers followed with a letter in  Science . Although most groups kept their actions to appeals, others were more hands-on. The Massachusetts-based Physicians for Human Rights campaigned publicly, and used its well-established political networks to quietly press the case. The International Human Rights Network of Academies and Scholarly Societies also worked behind the scenes. Meanwhile, a team of European experts in the molecular phylogenetics of viruses decided to apply their expertise to the HIV sequences of the infected children being treated in Europe. The initiative of the group, who until then knew little about the case apart from what they had read in the news, was to provide crucial new evidence. The initial phylogenetic analyses of the sequences confirmed epidemiological evidence that the infection had started at the hospital before the medical workers had started working there. As the retrial drew to a close, the researchers worked night and day to finish their analyses, suspending all other uses of their 40-processor cluster supercomputer to dedicate it solely to analysis of the Libyan sequences. Given the stakes, the team tested and re-tested their findings using multiple models. \u201cWe decided to throw the book at the data,\u201d recalls Oliver Pybus, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Oxford, UK. The results of every model were concordant; the start of the outbreak predated the March 1998 arrival of the medical workers. The paper was published online in  Nature  on 6 December, just before the scheduled court verdict (see  Nature   444 , 836\u2013837; 2006). On 19 December, the court again handed down the death sentence to the medical workers. But if the findings had no effect on the court decision, they nonetheless had a major indirect effect by highlighting that scientific evidence had been ignored. The paper, coming on top of the Nobel letter and the rest of the scientific advocacy, catalysed an explosion of international outrage to the verdict, putting intense pressure on both Libya and the international community to renew efforts to find a way out of the crisis. Then, on 1 January 2007, Bulgaria joined the European Union \u2014 a further turning point in the case, as it could now count on the diplomatic clout of the 27-nation body. In the months that followed, the most prominent role in talks was by diplomats from the European Commission and Britain, and from Seif al-Islam Gaddafi \u2014 a key intermediary through his charity, the Gaddafi Development Foundation. By contrast, US officials, although calling for Libya to exercise clemency, did not figure prominently behind the scenes. \n               Political influence \n             Events accelerated in early June, with visits to Libya by Benita Ferrero-Waldner, the European commissioner for external affairs; Tony Blair, the British prime minister at the time; and Frank-Walter Steinmeier, the German foreign minister. A possible deal that emerged was that the Supreme Court would uphold the death-penalty verdict, but that this would be quickly cancelled by a higher political body. The strength of the international medical and scientific advocacy gave diplomats additional grounds to push towards reaching a speedy conclusion. The broad contours of the proposed deal remain as they have long seemed: humanitarian aid for long-term treatment of the infected children, which scientists emphasize is essential as the children too are victims of the tragedy. Families of the children, who have been told for years that the medics were guilty, are expected to receive US$1 million per child in compensation, funnelled through the Gaddafi foundation. Media reports have portrayed this as debt relief for money Libya owes dating back many decades. But the finer details of the diplomatic settlement remain shrouded in mystery, and it is far from clear as to where the money will come from. For Roberts, the experience of this case has convinced him that scientists can do more in human-rights causes. Writing letters is useful, he says, but scientists can make a bigger difference if they engage personally with the diplomats and others involved. \u201cWe scientists can be much more effective if we are prepared to spend the time fighting for the issues in which we believe strongly.\u201d \n                     Libyan court upholds death sentences \n                   \n                     Diplomatic talks spur hope in Libya HIV case \n                   \n                     Europe condemns Libyan trial verdict \n                   \n                     Medics sentenced to death in Libya  \n                   \n                     Molecular HIV evidence backs accused medics \n                   \n                     Web focus AIDS medics in Libya \n                   \n                     Nature newsblog \n                   \n                     \u201cYou are not alone\u201d campaign \n                   \n                     European Union site on Libya \n                   \n                     Gaddafi Foundation for Development \n                   \n                     Declan Butler blog on case \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Neuroscientists have found that people who experience a strong dose of pleasure at the thought of an upcoming reward are more susceptible to the placebo effect. The research shows how the placebo effect, in which patients perceive a benefit from a medical treatment despite it having no genuine therapeutic activity, hinges on the brain's 'reward centre' \u2014 a region that predicts our future expectations of positive experiences, and which is also implicated in gambling and drug addiction. Greater activity in this brain region, called the nucleus accumbens, is linked to a stronger placebo effect, the new research shows. This kind of mechanistic understanding of how the brain reacts to placebo treatments could help doctors to boost the effect, argues Jon-Kar Zubieta of the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, who led the research. \"This is driving the idea that you can manipulate the placebo effect, to increase it for therapeutic treatment,\" he says. Conversely, reducing or eliminating variations in the placebo effect could improve the accuracy of medical trials, which evaluate the effects of new therapies against that of a placebo. Reducing the variation in placebo effects among different volunteers could help to standardize trial results.  \n              Great expectations \n            Zubieta and his team evaluated the placebo effect by giving volunteers a painful injection of salt solution into the cheek. Subjects were then told that they would be randomly assigned an injection either of painkiller or of placebo. In fact, all volunteers received a placebo. Later, some of the same patients were retested and not offered a second injection at all. Participants generally reported more reduction in pain when given the placebo injections than those not given any placebo treatment at all, Zubieta and his colleagues report in the journal  Neuron 1 . But the volunteers showed significant variations in the strength of their placebo effects. The researchers suspected that the effect may be linked to the brain's reward centre, which kicks into life when a reward (in this case, pain relief) is expected. They scanned the brains of 14 of their 30 volunteers to monitor the production in the nucleus accumbens of a brain signalling chemical called dopamine, which is boosted in response to reward anticipation. Activity in the nucleus accumbens was greater in those patients experiencing a strong placebo effect, the researchers found. \"If your dopamine system doesn't work very well your placebo effect is probably going to stink,\" Zubieta says. What's more, people who tended to show a strong placebo effect also had higher reward expectation in general, as demonstrated by a game in which they were told that they would be given varying amounts of money. During the game, their brains were scanned to assess their levels of optimism that the reward would be a handsome one.  \n              Brain booster \n            The findings raise the possibility that patients could be given medically active drugs to activate or boost the placebo effect, although Zubieta warns that we don't really know how to do this yet. Drugs already exist to boost the brain's dopamine system, but can have a bizarre range of side effects, including turning patients into reckless gamblers as their reward-expectation centre goes into overdrive, he points out.  A better way to approach the problem might be to encourage doctors to be upbeat when telling patients about their treatments, suggests Chris Frith, a neuropsychologist at University College London. That should boost the patients' anticipation of reward and cure. \"The doctors who do best are the ones who are most deluded that their treatments do work,\" he says. It is still unclear how any anticipation of reward might then specifically affect the physiological problem being suffered by a patient. It is possible that the reward-anticipation triggers the production of homemade painkillers called endogenous opioids, for example. If so, it may be possible for people to control the release of such chemicals through thought (and belief) alone. \"Is it possible to release these at will?\" Frith asks.  \n             Visit our  \n             \n                 newsblog \n               \n              to read and post comments about this story. \n           \n                   Neuron \n                 \n                   University of Michigan Molecular and Behavioral Neuroscience Institute \n                 Reprints and Permissions"},

British experts have criticized the focus of current climate projections. They say that scientists should shift from models that predict what will happen many decades from now, and concentrate instead on shorter-term forecasts that will aid policy-makers, businesses and the public. Climate models such as those used in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reports have been instrumental in convincing the world that climate change threatens ecosystems and human societies, but they do not provide much practical guidance. \u201cWe may not be providing what we possibly could,\u201d says Peter Cox, a climate modeller at the University of Exeter, UK, and former chair of climate-system dynamics at the UK Met Office. Cox and his colleague David Stephenson, also at the University of Exeter, published their argument last week (P. Cox and D. Stephenson  Science   317,  207\u2013208; 2007). \u201cThe IPCC has nailed many old questions,\u201d says Cox. \u201cIt's a done deal, so we had better move on.\u201d A key question is how to make climate-change models socially relevant. Cox and Stephenson propose having climate forecasters shift their attention to around 2050, rather than trying to predict farther into the future. This would effectively mean that the timescale of climate predictions would match that over which long-term policy and business planning is carried out. The authors note that climate models are least uncertain for between 30 and 50 years from now. Shorter-term predictions will be less accurate because of uncertainty over initial conditions. Changes that will transpire over the next three decades are essentially \u201calready in the system\u201d, says Cox. For predictions more than 50 years in the future, uncertainty levels in the models increase because no one can accurately forecast the level of carbon dioxide emissions resulting from human activity. Between 30 and 50 years away is thus a sort of sweet spot in which to target policy planning, Cox says. Mitigation policies and plans for associated socioeconomic factors, such as economic growth, energy use and technology needs, could be developed with that time frame in mind. Some of those involved in the IPCC process do not disagree in principle, but say the inherent uncertainty of climate models will always make forecasting difficult. \u201cFocusing on what 'should be' is a worthy goal going forward, but not a panacea for the uncertainty problem,\u201d says Cynthia Rosenzweig, a climate modeller at NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York, and a coordinating lead author of the most recent IPCC review, published this year. Another report released last week also criticizes the \u201cbig gap\u201d between how climate scenarios are currently used and their \u201cpotential contributions\u201d to policy making. The report was co-authored by Rosenzweig, and is the second in a series by the US Climate Change Science Program. The current generation of climate scenarios is still useful for resource managers to guide their preparation for climate change over the next few decades. Planning for such change is becoming \u201cmainstream\u201d in water-management systems, coasts and human health care, says Rosenzweig. \n                     Tackling greenhouse gases looks to be affordable \n                   \n                     Climate report released \n                   \n                     The costs of global warming \n                   \n                     In Focus Climate Change \n                   \n                     US Climate Change Science Program \n                   \n                     IPCC \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

This Thursday, the government of Cusco, a region in the Peruvian Andes, is scheduled to ban all genetically modified (GM) varieties of potato, according to the London-based International Institute for Environment and Development (IIED). The area was the birthplace of many varieties of spud, and is still home to thousands of kinds of potato, from the notoriously hard to peel  q'achun waq'achi  to the dark grey  amakjaya . The move was supported by a Peruvian non-profit organization called Association ANDES, along with the IIED. The motivation is both to ensure that genes from GM potatoes do not infiltrate the native potatoes, and to support efforts to market the area as a source of diverse, authentic, organic potato varieties. Alejandro Argumedo, associate director of Association ANDES, cites emotional and economic reasons, as well as cautiousness, for the decision. \"This is a potato land. All potatoes have meaning. Potatoes are believed to have spirit,\" he says. But also, he adds, \"There is great concern of contamination at the centres of origin.\" The ban will also keep cheaper GM spuds from competing with the more expensive local varieties.  Argumedo has long been involved in repatriating varieties of potato that had gone locally extinct, but are held in repositories such as the International Potato Center (CIP) in Lima. \"When the potatoes came back, the culture came back,\" he says. \"Genetic diversity and cultural diversity are closely linked.\"  \n              Not grown from seed \n            The growth of GM crops in areas where the genetic diversity of those crops are of significant cultural importance has caused controversy before. There have been concerns that growing GM maize in Mexico, for example, might be a bad idea (see ' Report recommends ban of US GM maize in Mexico '). But some note that there are ways of allaying fears about the accidental spread of GM potatoes. Creating types without viable seeds can help to prevent genetic dispersal. Spuds can be grown asexually by planting the sprouts, or 'eyes', from last year's crop. Other varieties are grown from seed each year.  This month, the CIP announced the creation of a male-sterile potato that is resistant to the pest tuber moth ( Phthorimaea operculella ). This, according to Marc Ghislain, head of the biotechnology laboratory at CIP, should lessen fears that biotechnologically manipulated genes from this potato will be spread about. In 2004, a group headed by Howard Atkinson of the University of Leeds, UK, worked on male-sterile potatoes and concluded that with this method, \"scientific progress is possible without compromise to the precautionary principle\" 1 .

And although the institute will still be built at Gugging, fears have abated that the distance may make it less attractive as a workplace. Harari says that the campus \u201chas fantastic potential \u2014 when you actually go there you can see that\u201d. And the institute may \u201ccome to life in a cloistered atmosphere,\u201d suggests physicist Olaf K\u00fcbler, chair of the scientific advisory board and former president of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology \u2014 ETH Zurich. Zeilinger has since returned to the scientific board and board of trustees, although he refuses to comment on the political decisions about the location. With the decision to proceed now firmly in place, outside observers also see the need to gather leading scientists together. \u201cNow it is necessary for the Institute of Science and Technology to reach a chain-reaction mass, so that it can get on with its work in the absence of closely neighbouring institutes,\u201d says Christoph Kratky, a molecular biologist from the University of Graz and head of the Austrian science fund FWF in Vienna. The institute will not be part of the existing group of Austrian universities, which is largely seen as overly bureaucratic and not able to offer competitive packages to top scientists. Germany and Italy, whose universities share the same historical system, have also toyed with the idea of building an elite graduate school from scratch. Germany, however, abandoned the idea in favour of topping up funding of existing universities that perform well, and the Italian Institute of Technology is floundering. Government and industrial sources are supporting the Austrian project to the tune of 500 million euros over 10 years. If all goes to plan, the institute will eventually employ 500 people. With construction beginning in autumn, scientists who don't need complex equipment are expected to start work next year. \n                     Blurred vision \n                   \n                     Scepticism greets EU plan for virtual institute \n                   \n                     IST \u2014 Austria \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

As the new president, Sarkozy has now personally weighed in on a reform bill that will be fast-tracked through parliament this summer. The bill, adopted by the cabinet on 4 July, is historic as it would make France's 85 public universities much more independent, largely freeing them from the current centralized state control. Sarkozy has also confirmed that universities will receive an extra \u20ac5 billion (US$ 6.8 billion) over the next five years. Most people agree that this sum, and much more, is badly needed. Whereas the \u00e9lite Grandes Ecoles \u2014 which scoop the best few per cent of students \u2014 are well-heeled, the underfunded universities must cope with most of the remainder. The bill would allow universities to own and manage their own buildings, to control their budgets, and to hire and set salaries as they see fit, all of which are currently controlled by the science and higher-education ministry. At present, a star biologist might earn no more than a philosopher of the same bureaucratic grade. Top international research talent often passes French universities by. The bill would also modernize governance. University presidents have had few real powers, and whereas Anglo-Saxon universities typically form committees to headhunt the best leader, in France the presidents are elected by 130 members of the various university panels, and can serve only one four-year term. The university's direction is decided largely by a 60-strong board of directors that is often highly politicised. Under the new law, the board would be streamlined to 20\u201330 people, with an absolute majority agreeing on a president. The president, elected for a maximum of two four-year terms, would have executive power over almost all university affairs. The bill is just the start of broader university reform, says prime minister Fran\u00e7ois Fillon, who has described the future of French universities as the most important item on his domestic agenda. \n                     Science high on French political agenda \n                   \n                     French election: The candidates respond \n                   \n                     Plus \u00c3\u00a7a change? \n                   \n                     French science after Chirac \n                   \n                     French ministry of higher education and research \n                   \n                     French presidency (in English) \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Last week, more than 1,600 people involved in conserving Earth's flora and fauna came to Port Elizabeth, South Africa. It was the first time that the Society for Conservation Biology, based in Arlington, Virginia, had met in Africa, and the setting raised a challenging question: does conservation help poor people? Some researchers think that conservation work will naturally and inevitably benefit local people, because it will sustain resources over time. But conserving animals and plants often means restricting access to them. And as Yaa Ntiamoa-Baidu, a Ghanaian conservationist, asked those gathered at the opening plenary session: \u201cDo your conservation projects make a difference in village life in Africa?\u201d To try to get some data with which to answer her own question, Ntiamoa-Baidu, who works with the conservation group WWF and the Ghanaian government, looked at 50 projects in Africa. Of the project managers surveyed, 92% thought that they were making a difference on the community level. But projects that tried to measure the effects \u2014 such as a wetland conservation project in Ghana that measures the number of new enterprises created by an eco-tourism effort \u2014 were few and far between. Hardly any of the 50 projects had any built-in way to quantify or demonstrate their benefits. \u201cWhy is it that we do not have concrete data to support this?\u201d Ntiamoa-Baidu asked. In a session on the link between conservation and poverty, Peter Kareiva of Seattle, Washington, chief scientist at the Nature Conservancy, presented an analysis of almost 200 development projects run by the World Bank, some of which had environmental components. Encouragingly, he found that development projects with built-in conservation goals were no less effective than those without them, as measured by the World Bank's evaluations. But his data do not address the issue of how effective conservation projects are if they include specific development goals in their remit. Many hope that local researchers will take the lead on conservation projects. \u201cIf Africans have the empowerment and the tools, they will have to make these decisions themselves,\u201d says Jonathan Adams, also of the Nature Conservancy. In South Africa, there are hopes that more black people will take careers as conservation scientists. According to Brian Huntley, an environmental adviser to the South African government, black conservation scientists are only now starting to emerge, more than a dozen years after the end of apartheid, and he thinks that their number will increase exponentially. But for many South Africans, continued poverty and the lingering social effects of apartheid are daunting obstacles to such a career. \u201cWhen we were kids, we weren't allowed to go to the aquarium or anything like that, so how were we to learn that saving nature was important?\u201d asks Mncedi Nkosi, a young, black, freshwater ecologist at Ezemvelo KZN Wildlife, a province-level public\u2013private conservation group. \u201cMost people still are more worried about socioeconomic issues, and they don't really understand what I do. I sometimes just say that I clean water for a living.\u201d About one-third of the 700 papers and posters at the conference were presented by Africans, according to the meeting's organizer, Graham Kerley. \n                     Life on the edge \n                   \n                     Hundreds of threatened species falling through conservation gaps \n                   \n                     Corruption is undermining conservation \n                   \n                     Lessons from the jungle \n                   \n                     SCB blog \n                   \n                     21st annual SCB meeting \n                   \n                     Ezemvelo KwaZulu \n                   \n                     Convention on Biological Diversity \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Controversy over a ground-breaking study of an experimental HIV prevention tool has underscored the field's need to revamp its approach to clinical trials. On 23 May, researchers at the Centre for the AIDS Programme of Research in South Africa (CAPRISA) began a US$13.5-million study to test whether a microbicide gel containing the antiretroviral drug tenofovir prevents women from becoming infected with HIV during sex. The trial, funded by the US Agency for International Development (USAID), is the first to test a so-called second-generation microbicide \u2014 one that specifically targets the AIDS virus. Researchers and advocates say that microbicides in the form of gels or creams, applied to the vagina, could provide crucial protection for women who cannot negotiate condom use with their partners. Currently, 11 microbicide candidates are being tested in clinical trials. But some experts are concerned that the \u201cCAPRISA 004\u201d trial, which includes 980 women at two sites in South Africa, is doomed because of its design. \u201cThe microbicide development field cannot afford to take a further hit,\u201d says virologist Mark Wainberg of McGill University in Montreal, Canada. That is because three 'first-generation' microbicides, which make the vagina inhospitable to a range of microbes, have already failed efficacy trials, and two \u2014 cellulose sulphate and nonoxynol-9 \u2014 actually increased women's risk of infection (see  Nature   446 , 12; doi:10.1038/446012b 2007 ). Investigators are due to release the final analysis of the cellulose sulphate trial at the International AIDS Society meeting in Sydney, Australia, later this month. But scientists say the failure of that trial highlights the need to proceed cautiously with further microbicide studies. The most controversial issue in the CAPRISA trial is the dosage schedule. This requires women to apply the gel once within 12 hours before sex and again within 12 hours after sex. The schedule is designed for women whose partners are home for short periods of time, says study leader Salim Abdool Karim of the University of KwaZulu-Natal in South Africa. But opponents say there isn't enough published evidence from trials in animals or humans to support this dosage schedule. Some would prefer the women to apply daily doses of the gel. Karim disagrees, saying that \u201cgetting these women to use a product every day is going to be a challenge.\u201d Critics say the proposed dosage regime will result in a poor trial outcome. \u201cIt will be hard to link the data to the way the gel is being used, which will potentially make it very difficult to make any interpretation of the data,\u201d says microbicide researcher Robin Shattock at St George's, University of London. The concern has led scientists and others, including Renee Ridzon of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation in Seattle, Washington, and Zeda Rosenberg of the International Partnership for Microbicides based in Silver Spring, Maryland, to call for the CAPRISA investigators to rethink their approach. Such concerns prompted the US Global AIDS Coordinator to convene a telephone conference on 6 June with scientists, advocates and US government agencies to discuss the trial design \u2014 a first for a USAID-funded microbicide study. After the telephone conference, the Office of the Global AIDS Coordinator declined to modify or stop the trial. But scientists are still urging the CAPRISA investigators to reconsider, and Karim has agreed to discuss the issue further, at least informally with some of the critics. \u201cWe have put the issue on the table and I feel we are on our way to resolution,\u201d he says. The situation has caused leaders in the microbicide field to renew calls for better ways of reviewing and coordinating trial plans. Scientists in the field already share and discuss ideas and data through formal and informal meetings, but there is no mechanism for reviewing and disseminating plans for clinical trials. This means that institutions sometimes run redundant trials that are not always backed by good evidence, says immunologist John Moore of the Weill Cornell Medical College in New York. \u201cHistorically, the microbicide field has gotten it wrong by doing multiple simultaneous trials of similar products, and the CAPRISA episode represents a boiling-up of frustration in the field,\u201d Moore says. The study had already been approved by many bodies \u2014 including the South African Medicines Control Council, and ethics review boards convened by the University of KwaZulu-Natal and by Family Health International, the group that is running the trial. USAID staff decided to grant funding for the study in April after conducting its own internal review, says Jeff Spieler, senior science adviser in USAID's office of global and reproductive health. But few preclinical results have been made publicly available, leaving scientists and advocates uneasy about the trial. Normally, the development of a product such as a microbicide would be sponsored by a private company, which would not be obligated to consult the public beyond regulatory agencies. But such companies are not interested in developing microbicides because they are aimed at poor people, so the field is funded largely by limited public resources. Advocates argue that this means the public deserves full access to all the relevant data. \u201cWe need a transparent, accessible and international mechanism of peer review and reflection for making decisions that are of fundamental importance to the microbicide field,\u201d says Lori Heise, director of the Global Campaign for Microbicides, an advocacy group based in Washington DC. Spieler says USAID has decided to consult external reviewers for future trials. And the National Institutes of Health's Office of AIDS Research is setting up a microbicide working group.

During the eighteenth century, Giovanni Domenico Tiepolo (son of the more famous Giovanni Battista Tiepolo) was commissioned by the prince-bishop of W\u00fcrzburg to depict the biblical story of the flight of the Holy Family from King Herod. But did he start the series of 24 etchings, called  The Flight into Egypt , in his hometown of Venice, Italy, or only after he arrived in W\u00fcrzburg, Germany, at around 1750? Art historians in Freiburg, Germany, have now acquired the technology to help them solve this long-standing mystery. The method allows watermarks to be seen  in situ  without damaging the paper in which they are embedded. It was developed by scientists at the Technical University Braunschweig and the Fraunhofer Institute for Wood Research, also in Braunschweig, and was first tested last year on Rembrandt sketches. Paper mills have characteristic watermarks that are visible when the paper is held to the light, although not when they are obscured by ink. X-ray analysis can be used to identify obscured watermarks, but it needs special conditions to protect the paper from radiation. Delicate materials therefore usually need to be transported, and museum curators are often reluctant to do this. In the new method, a plate warmed to 35\u201340 \u00b0C is placed behind the paper for one second, during which an infrared camera captures the heat passing through it. The outline of the watermark is revealed because it lets more heat through than does the rest of the paper. The picture here illustrates an early etching for the series, together with its watermark (inset), as exposed by the thermography technique. It is part of the exhibition Giandomenico Tiepolo: The Flight into Egypt, which opens this week and runs until 16 September at the Augustiner Museum in Freiburg. All the watermarks stem from a paper mill not far from W\u00fcrzburg, so Domenico almost certainly started work on the series after he arrived in Germany. \n                     Snapshot: Over the Moon \n                   \n                     Augustinermuseum \n                   \n                     Herzog Anton Ulrich museum \n                   \n                     Fraunhofer Institute for Wood Research \n                   \n                     Exhibition at the Herzog Anton Ulrich Museum, Braunschweig \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Researchers have developed a library of transgenic fruitflies that will allow them to investigate genes in specific tissues or developmental stages across the whole of the insect's genome. The library, which consists of genes known as RNA interference (RNAi) transgenes, is described this week in  Nature  (see  page 151 ). The transgenes act to silence their target genes, enabling researchers to work out the function of genes that would be lethal if switched off throughout the whole organism. The fruitfly  Drosophila  is a model organism for developmental biologists. And  Drosophila  researchers have been using RNAi for years, but typically for testing only a few genes at a time. \u201cWe didn't invent anything here,\u201d says Barry Dickson, a molecular biologist at the Research Institute of Molecular Pathology in Vienna and lead author of the latest paper. \u201cWe were just crazy enough to go for the whole genome.\u201d Previously, genome-wide screens were used only in cell-culture experiments, and results had to be confirmed in live flies. Now, Dickson and his colleagues have created a collection of 22,270 lines of transgenic fruitfly in which 12,088 genes can be silenced \u2014 about 88% of the fly's predicted protein-coding genes. Each fly contains an RNAi transgene that silences a targeted gene only in the presence of a protein called GAL4. Crossing the RNAi-containing strain with a strain that expresses GAL4 in a specific tissue activates RNAi only in that tissue. In  Drosophila,  unlike in many other insects, the RNAi signal does not travel from cell to cell. The lines offer researchers the chance to trawl for tissue-specific functions of genes involved in fruitfly development. Dickson's lab, for example, studies a gene called  fruitless  that regulates mating behaviour. The gene's role went undiscovered for years because flies lacking it don't survive. But the auspicious discovery of fly mutants in which one form of the  fruitless  protein was absent in a select group of neurons revealed that the gene was crucial in triggering courtship behaviour in male flies. In their latest study, Dickson's team took a sample of 50 genes that were lethal when silenced in all the fly's cells, and silenced them selectively in the eye, wing or thorax. Only a third of the silenced genes were still lethal. Another third were found to cause specific developmental defects in the tissues in which they were expressed. Researchers have already started to use the lines to search for genes involved in eye development, courtship behaviour and the RNAi mechanism itself. \u201cThis library is a great, great tool,\u201d says Michael Boutros, a geneticist at the German Cancer Research Center in Heidelberg. \u201cI think it will be heavily used in the future.\u201d Boutros's lab plans to use the strains to study the  Drosophila  immune system. The library generated by Dickson's group is available through the Vienna Drosophila RNAi Center, which opened in April. It already sends out about 2,000 strains each week. Potential users would do well to order soon, though: because the centre doesn't have the funds to maintain duplicate lines, there is no back-up when a vial of flies dies. The facility is currently losing RNAi strains at the rate of about two per week. That's a common problem for the  Drosophila  community, says Claude Desplan, a molecular geneticist at New York University. \u201cQuite a number of people are coming out with large collections of flies,\u201d he says. \u201cBut people don't know how they're going to maintain them.\u201d Dickson says he has been unable to secure government funding for the stock centre and must rely on user fees. The going rate is about \u20ac10 (US$14) a vial, each containing tens to hundreds of flies. Other  Drosophila  RNAi libraries are also in the works. One, created by Ryu Ueda of the National Institute of Genetics in Shizuoka, Japan, contains 13,000 strains so far. \u201cThis is useful because the two projects together give us more strength to cover the full genome,\u201d says Christophe Antoniewski of the Pasteur Institute in Paris. Antoniewski has been using Ueda's lines to study how RNA regulates gene expression, and plans to order lines from Dickson as well. A third library, still in early development, is being created at Norbert Perrimon's lab at Harvard Medical School in Boston. Whereas Dickson and Ueda created their libraries by randomly inserting the RNAi transgenes, Perrimon aims to target his transgenes to a specific region in the genome. This ensures that a transgene will not land in a region of the genome that may affect the gene's expression. \u201cThe level of expression is critical,\u201d says Perrimon, \u201cand expression is very position-specific.\u201d RNAi transgenes that aren't fully expressed can lead to false-negative results. Meanwhile, Dickson's group has found that low expression of an RNAi transgene can often be counteracted by overexpressing a gene called  dicer-2  that is involved in the RNAi pathway. \u201cThis usually helps, but it can also be dangerous,\u201d says Dickson. Overexpressing  dicer-2  can increase the risk of inadvertently silencing other genes. Such caveats are always present with high-throughput procedures, says Desplan. \u201cUntil we see how people use it, there's a wait and see position,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I'm very optimistic.\u201d \n                     If in doubt, interfere \n                   \n                     Fruitflies tap in to their gay side \n                   \n                     Gay flies lose their nerve \n                   \n                     Nature RNAi web focus \n                   \n                     Nature RNAi Insight \n                   \n                     Vienna Drosophila RNAi Center \n                   \n                     National Institute of Genetics Fly Stock Center \n                   \n                     Harvard Medical School  Drosophila  RNAi Screening Center \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

A technique that could sidestep many of the limitations and ethical concerns that plague the production of human embryonic stem cells was unveiled late last month by a team of US and Russian researchers. The group managed to derive embryonic stem cells from an unfertilized egg \u2014 avoiding the need to use viable embryos. \u201cThis is one of the papers we've been waiting for,\u201d says George Daley, a stem-cell expert at the Children's Hospital in Boston, Massachusetts, who was not part of the collaboration. But he and others caution that more work needs to be done before the method can be tried in the clinic. And the technique's dependence on access to fresh, unfertilized eggs \u2014 a controversial resource \u2014 is also likely to limit its application. The team, led by Elena Revazova and Jeffrey Janus of Lifeline Cell Technology, a biotechnology company in Walkersville, Maryland, created embryos by activating an unfertilized egg using chemicals rather than fertilizing it with sperm (E. S. Revazova  et al .  Cloning Stem Cells   9 , doi:10.1089/clo.2007.0033; 2007). Some lizards, birds and insects can reproduce without the need for a male \u2014 a process known as parthenogenesis \u2014 but mammalian parthenotes cannot develop past an early-stage embryo. Revazova and her team managed to get the embryos to develop far enough for them to yield stem cells. The resulting cells express the same proteins as normal embryonic stem cells and proliferate for an extended period of at least 10 months, the team says. The cells also seem capable of developing into the three primary tissue types. \u201cFor all intents and purposes, they are the same\u201d as regular embryonic stem cells, Janus says. He hopes that the technique will help solve one of the problems associated with stem cells derived from embryos left over from  in vitro  fertilization (IVF) procedures. Stem cells derived from IVF embryos would not be genetically matched to patients and so if used to treat them would probably provoke an immune response. But, says Janus, stem cells from the parthenogenetic embryos should be compatible with the donor's immune system. He admits, however, that \u201cthis will have to be proven in a clinical trial\u201d. Daley has already done a proof-of-principle study in mice, in which he transplanted parthenogenetic embryonic stem cells back into the mice without provoking an immune reaction (K. Kim  et al .  Science   315,  482\u2013486; 2007). But the cells would be a direct match only for women, of course, although they might be a good enough immunological match to work for relatives of the donor women too. An alternative approach might be to create a bank of parthenogenetic cells that represent all the immunological 'families' \u2014 although estimates for the number of cell lines this would require range from 50 to 1,000. Revazova and her colleagues next plan to make cells that could treat liver disease, diabetes and the eye condition macular degeneration. But there are potential problems. Cells express genes differently depending on the parent who provided them. So the next step is to see whether the parthenogenetic cells behave the same as normal cells once they have been turned into a specific tissue type, says Jose Cibelli, a stem-cell researcher at Michigan State University in East Lansing. Daley notes that there have been problems in mice. When parthenogenetic cells were mixed with normal embryonic cells to form a 'chimaera', abnormalities caused poor tissue growth. \u201cIt is unclear whether this will be a problem if fully formed tissues are made  in vitro  and transplanted into an adult,\u201d he adds. Janus says the team hopes to begin safety trials in animals in early 2008, using retinal cells produced by the technique. If all goes well, similar trials in people could begin in late 2008 for treating macular degeneration. The researchers are optimistic about the efficiency of their technique, saying that they established 6 cell lines using 46 eggs from 5 women. \u201cI am convinced the work can be repeated,\u201d says Cibelli. Use of the technology will be limited by its source: women who bear healthy eggs. The ethics of getting eggs will also be a problem. Janus says the team recruited donors in Russia from women who were undergoing IVF procedures. The team's paper says no financial payment was made to the donors, but Janus says they did cover some costs of the IVF treatment. Last year, a team at the University of Milan in Italy claimed to have produced parthenogenetic embryonic stem cells, but their results have yet to be published (see  Nature   441 , 1038; 2006). And significant steps were recently made for another promising method of producing patient-specific cells using genes inserted into mouse skin cells to reprogramme them to an embryonic state (see  Nature   447 , 618\u2013619; doi:10.1038/447618a 2007 ). The method that would give cells that are the best match for the patient \u2014 cloning \u2014 has so far failed. With more than 2,000 eggs, South Korea's Woo Suk Hwang failed to produce a single cloned cell line. Ironically, he produced parthenogenetic stem cells \u2014 but his team failed to recognize them as such and carried out none of the analyses that could have won the group kudos for the achievement. \n                     Simple switch turns cells embryonic \n                   \n                     Human eggs supply \u2018ethical\u2019 stem cells \n                   \n                     Cloning: Do we even need eggs? \n                   \n                     Eggs alone \n                   \n                     Hwang \n                   \n                     Stem cells \n                   \n                     Making stem cells \n                   \n                     Lifeline's parent company \n                   \n                     Russian Academy of Medical Sciences \n                   \n                     Related patents \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

The Olduvai Gorge, perhaps the most famous location in palaeoanthropology, has become a battleground for two research groups. Last week the rivals met to resolve their differences, but tensions remain high. The Tanzanian site in question is where, in 1959, Mary Leakey found the first skull of the species  Paranthropus boisei . The following year, the Leakey team returned to find the first fossils of  Homo habilis . The discoveries at Olduvai encouraged researchers to follow the course of Africa's Great Rift Valley up through Kenya and Ethiopia, where a host of new human relations were found in subsequent decades. Numerous teams have tried to pin down the relationships between the bones and artefacts, and to piece together a sense of the lives the various species led two million years ago. For 18 years, the Olduvai Landscape Paleoanthropology Project (OLAPP) \u2014 led by anthropologist Robert Blumenschine of Rutgers University in New Brunswick, New Jersey, archaeologist Fidelis Masao of the University of Dar es Salaam and Jackson Njau, principal curator at Tanzania's National Natural History Museum in Arusha \u2014 has collected plant and animal specimens to learn how these early relatives of man lived in the region (R. J. Blumenschine  et al .  Science  299, 1217\u20131221; 2003). Last summer, the OLAPP team was distressed to learn that Tanzanian officials had issued permits to a group led by Manuel Dom\u00ednguez-Rodrigo, of Complutense University in Madrid, and Audauz Mabulla, of the University of Dar es Salaam, to dig within the OLAPP region. The OLAPP researchers then found the competing group a kilometre away from their campsite, probing trenches the OLAPP team had dug near the bed where Leakey uncovered 'Zinj', the original  P. boisei  skull. In general, researchers like to collect material in a standardized way. If a new group disturbs a site, it can harm the previous team's study if, for example, different collection techniques are used. The OLAPP team objected to the Tanzanian authorities and the Dom\u00ednguez-Rodrigo/Mabulla excavation was stopped. This prompted an angry response from Dom\u00ednguez-Rodrigo and Mabulla on the website of the Cultural Association for the Study of the Quaternary in the Cantabrian Region ( http://www.accuca.conectia.es ). Dom\u00ednguez-Rodrigo also attacked the OLAPP group in newspaper articles in Madrid and Dar es Salaam. On the website, Dom\u00ednguez-Rodrigo and Mabulla doubled OLAPP's grant total (US$2 million instead of $1 million), said that OLAPP had published only two articles (a project bibliography notes 32 articles, 8 book chapters and 12 graduate theses) and accused OLAPP leaders of \u201cunethical behaviour\u201d by blocking them using \u201cpolitical influence\u201d. The OLAPP researchers summarized the charges in their abstract for the first East African Association of Palaeoanthropology and Palaeontology Conference, which leading researchers attended on 18\u201320 June in Nairobi, Kenya. In their abstract, the OLAPP researchers wrote that Dom\u00ednguez-Rodrigo falsely accused them of \u201cbribing Tanzanian officials\u201d and characterized the competing group's approach as \u201cantagonistic, unethical, uncollegial and counterproductive\u201d. But the OLAPP leaders did not attend the meeting, instead rushing into the field in June to monitor the site as the competing group arrived, having received new permits. The OLAPP group sent a letter to the Nairobi meeting on 17 June, apologizing for not attending and petitioning attendees to \u201crenounce\u201d the competing group and to support the OLAPP's call for \u201can apology and retraction of allegations\u201d. But the meeting's organizers decided that in the interests of fairness the letter would not be read to attendees. In a phone interview from Olduvai last week, Dom\u00ednquez-Rodrigo said an apology wasn't necessary. There was no specific accusation of \u201cbribery\u201d, he said, but of \u201cunethical behaviour and interfering in local politics\u201d. He declined to elaborate on these charges so as not to interfere with ongoing negotiations. \u201cWe've taken all the measures we could to avoid conflict,\u201d he said. \u201cThe situation is awkward for both groups.\u201d Last week the two teams agreed to cohabit for the season to come. Dom\u00ednguez-Rodrigo says he wants \u201cto enlarge the area where Leakey excavated\u201d, applying modern techniques to analyse stone tools and fossils. The 50th anniversary of Zinj's discovery is coming, and Dom\u00ednguez-Rodrigo has a book being published. John Kimaro, a Tanzanian antiquities officer overseeing Olduvai, says the government is considering guidelines for such situations, in which it seeks to maximize researcher access. Meanwhile, observing researchers hope the years of research on 'the hallowed ground' of the Zinj fossils aren't harmed in the fray. \n                     The first skull of Australopithecus boisei \n                   \n                     Stone Age Institute \n                   \n                     Leakey Foundation \n                   \n                     Olduvai crocodile-chewed bones \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

A study has confirmed that there are no grounds to blame the Sun for recent global warming. The analysis shows that global warming since 1985 has been caused neither by an increase in solar radiation nor by a decrease in the flux of galactic cosmic rays (M. Lockwood and C. Fr\u00f6hlich  Proc. R. Soc. A  doi:10.1098/rspa.2007.1880; 2007). Some researchers had suggested that the latter might influence global warming through an involvement in cloud formation. \u201cThis paper is the final nail in the coffin for people who would like to make the Sun responsible for present global warming,\u201d says Stefan Rahmstorf, a climate scientist at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany. Claims that the Sun, rather than raised levels of greenhouse gases, has been responsible for recent warming have persisted in a small number of scientists and in parts of the media. Mike Lockwood, a physicist at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory in Chilton, UK, says he was \u201cgalvanized\u201d to carry out the comprehensive study by misleading media reports. He cites 'The Great Global Warming Swindle', a television programme shown in March by Britain's Channel 4, as a prime example. Together with Claus Fr\u00f6hlich of the World Radiation Center in Davos, Switzerland, Lockwood brought together solar data for the past 100 years. The two researchers averaged out the 11-year solar cycles and looked for correlation between solar variation and global mean temperatures. Solar activity peaked between 1985 and 1987. Since then, trends in solar irradiance, sunspot number and cosmic-ray intensity have all been in the opposite direction to that required to explain global warming. In 1997, Henrik Svensmark, a physicist at the Danish National Space Center in Copenhagen, suggested that cosmic rays facilitate cloud formation by seeding the atmosphere with trails of ions that can help water droplets form (H. Svensmark and E. J. Friis-Christensen  J. Atmos. Solar-Terrest. Phys.   59,  1225\u20131232; 1997). He proposed that, as a result of this, changes in the Sun's magnetic field that influence the flux of cosmic rays could affect Earth's climate. This led to claims that cosmic rays are the main influence on modern climate change. Even in the face of the new analysis, Svensmark insists that solar theories should not be dismissed. \u201cIf you look at temperatures in the troposphere, there is a remarkable correlation with solar activity,\u201d he says. Lockwood insists that none of the tropospheric data show the trend that the solar theory would need. Nir Shaviv, an astrophysicist at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem who has championed a Sun\u2013climate link, argues that there may be a lag in Earth's reaction to the Sun because of the thermal inertia of the oceans. But other climate researchers find the idea of a 'hidden' time lag unconvincing. \u201cWith each year, and with each new set of data that comes in, a time lag becomes ever more unlikely,\u201d says Urs Neu, deputy head of ProClim-, the climate and global change forum of the Swiss Academy of Sciences in Bern. On other timescales, however, Sun\u2013climate links may remain worthy of study. \u201cClimate change is a cocktail of many effects,\u201d says Jasper Kirkby, a physicist at CERN, the European particle-physics laboratory near Geneva in Switzerland, who is leading an experiment aimed at simulating the effect of cosmic rays on clouds. \u201cPast climate changes have clearly been associated with solar activity. Even if this is not the case now, it is still important to understand how solar variability affects climate.\u201d Ken Carslaw, an atmospheric scientist at the University of Leeds, UK, points out that solar effects might still be possible. They might have acted to cool the climate in recent decades, but been overwhelmed. If so, the climate could be more sensitive to greenhouse gases than is generally thought, and future temperature increases might be greater than expected if a countervailing solar effect comes to an end. \n                     Climate change: A cosmic connection \n                   \n                     The dark side of the Sun \n                   \n                     Galactic dust cooling Earth? \n                   \n                     In focus climate change \n                   \n                     Royal Society guide to facts and fictions about climate change \n                   \n                     Real Climate comments on 'The Global Warming Swindle' \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

The first substantial results from the world's largest detector of cosmic rays are being presented this week at a conference in Mexico. The Pierre Auger Cosmic Ray Observatory is already the largest cosmic-ray observatory in the world even though it is only three-quarters finished. It sprawls across more than 3,000 square kilometres of the Argentine pampas near the city of Malarg\u00fce \u2014 an area a tenth the size of Belgium. Researchers from the 15 countries collaborating on the US$50-million project hope that after its 1,600 detectors and 24 telescopes have been commissioned around the end of this year the observatory may reveal the origins of the highest-energy particles bombarding Earth from space. Among the results being presented at the International Cosmic Ray Conference in Mer\u00edda, Yucat\u00e1n on 3\u201311 July are new measurements of the energy spectrum of cosmic rays. The team confirms that above a threshold energy known as the GZK cut-off the number of cosmic-ray events falls sharply. Particles that start off with energies above this threshold are expected to be slowed down by interactions with the cosmic microwave background as they travel. Cosmic rays significantly above the cut-off energies would thus have to come from relatively nearby, which would imply that they were produced by strange new physics, such as the spontaneous decay of unknown massive particles. An experiment in Japan called the Akeno Giant Air Shower Array sparked excitement when it failed to see the cut-off in data obtained up to 2004. Since then, though, data from the High Resolution Fly's Eye \u2014 a detector in Utah \u2014 have provided evidence for the reality of the cut-off. The new Pierre Auger data seem to confirm that the cut-off is real. If there is no new physics in the form of particle decays or other exotic effects, though, there should be plenty of new astrophysics in understanding what sort of celestial mechanism might be pumping up incoming protons to energies millions of times higher than those produced by the most powerful Earth-based accelerators. One crucial step is to identify where in the sky they are coming from. Alan Watson of the University of Leeds, UK, a spokesman for the Pierre Auger project, says that the team has identified some interesting candidate regions of the sky, but won't reveal the details until it has obtained more data. \u201cUnless I talk in my sleep, even my wife doesn't know what these regions are,\u201d he says. \n                     News in brief \n                   \n                     Origin of energetic space particles pinpointed \n                   \n                     High-energy astrophysics: Let's catch some rays \n                   \n                     Argentine crisis rattles cosmic-ray hunters \n                   \n                     Homepage of Pierre Auger Cosmic Ray Observatory \n                   \n                     The High-Resolution Fly's Eye \n                   \n                     Akeno Giant Air Shower Array \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

When Al Gore and his colleagues dreamed up the idea of a climate-change consciousness-raising Live Earth event featuring concerts on every continent, they came up against a problem. The event's 7 July date corresponds with midwinter in the Antarctic, when no one gets on or off the seventh continent. So flying in Bono and Madonna to frolic with penguins would not be an option. Enter Nunatak, a five-strong band of guitar, bass, drums, fiddle and sax, whose members are part of the crew at the Rothera Research Station, run by the British Antarctic Survey (BAS). It is not the only band on the continent. Every New Year's Day, the US McMurdo base hosts the Icestock festival, and even in winter there's plenty of music. \u201cAll the bases have bands except maybe Bird Island, as there are only four overwintering people there,\u201d explains Julius Rix at the BAS's more southerly Halley base. But being the farthest north of the bigger bases gives Nunatak an advantage. \u201cRothera has double the satellite bandwidth compared to us,\u201d says Rix. And so Nunatak got the gig. Even so, the webcam set-up on Rothera isn't quite up to sending broadcast-quality sound and visuals live to the world. \u201cTo do it live we would need a very fast satellite link,\u201d says Matt Balmer, an electronics engineer and Nunatak's guitarist and songwriter. So the performance will be recorded 'as live' a day or so beforehand. \u201cWe're effectively e-mailing it in,\u201d says Balmer. Despite the technical delay, the performance should be pretty authentic. The band plans to perform outside \u2014 which might make their instruments \u201csound a bit funny\u201d, according to the BAS's Linda Capper, back in balmy Cambridge, UK, not withstanding the rigours faced by the performers. Balmer is tough enough to dismiss such worries: \u201cIt's only minus six outside; you get used to these sorts of temperatures.\u201d Nor does the prospect of a global audience chill him, in part because it doesn't feel that real. \u201cWe don't have an appreciation of it,\u201d says Balmer. \u201cWe see the world through the Internet.\u201d The last ship out of Rothera left in April. \u201cUntil October we won't see anybody else.\u201d Saxophonist and marine biologist Alison Massey expects the rest of the base to be an appreciative audience, not least because after weeks of rehearsal at close quarters, \u201cit will be the last time they'll hear the songs\u201d. Balmer hopes for something a bit more rock and roll: \u201cThere will probably be groupies throwing their underwear at us,\u201d he says.

In the wide-ranging shake-up of government that accompanied Gordon Brown's arrival as Britain's new prime minister, science got both a new home and a new minister in charge. Although the move had not been announced at the time  Nature  went to press, the new minister will be Ian Pearson, previously Minister of State for Climate Change and Environment. In a complex game of departmental division and recombination, Pearson will take office not in the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI), which used to be home to the science brief, but in the newly formed Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills (DIUS). This department marks a fusion between parts of the old DTI and part of the old Department for Education, and will also contain a new Office of the Chief Scientific Adviser. The trade part of the DTI's brief will now be shared by the Department for International Development and a new Department for Enterprise, Business and Regulatory Reform. Pearson comes to the science brief having worked recently on launching a consultation process on the introduction of a cap-and-trade carbon-reduction scheme for up to 5,000 UK businesses. Welcoming the appointment, a spokesperson for the Royal Society said: \u201cThe government's track record in climate change has been good recently and Ian Pearson has obviously played his part in that. If he brings that track record to science we'd be very much encouraged.\u201d A strong emphasis on the environment at high levels in government seems assured by the appointment of David Miliband as foreign secretary; as Secretary of State for the Environment, Miliband was a strong voice on climate change.

The creation of the DIUS, which in institutional terms will treat science as more closely linked to education than to enterprise, has received mixed reviews. \u201cIt makes sense to put science and higher education together,\u201d says Colin Blakemore, shortly to step down as chief executive of the Medical Research Council.

A new generation of sequencing machines is broadening horizons for users. Various groups have recently performed epigenetic studies \u2014 looking at modifications to the genome that control its expression \u2014 that would have been utterly impractical using old technologies. The latest approach fishes out all the DNA associated with a given marker, such as one of the histone proteins used to package genes in chromosomes. Then, instead of comparing each piece of DNA with a library of previously isolated sequences, as used to be done, scientists simply sequence the whole lot. The key to this approach is new technology such as that sold by Solexa, a company that earlier this year merged with Illumina of San Diego. \u201cThe amount of DNA sequence being produced by these machines is staggering,\u201d says Steven Jones, associate director of the Genome Sciences Centre at the British Columbia Cancer Agency in Vancouver. Working flat out, a Solexa 1G machine could triple the total amount of DNA sequence contained in the GenBank database in just one year. Jones's group looked at histone changes that control which regions of DNA can be read 1 . Meanwhile, scientists from the Broad Institute in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston used a Solexa machine to examine two types of histone modification in mouse cells. Their paper 2 , published online in  Nature  on 1 July, describes how these modifications change during development, and how such changes can either keep cells poised to switch fates, or close down their future options. \u201cThe excitement about this paper is that we now have a means of studying cellular state in a high-throughout manner,\u201d says Bradley Bernstein, a pathologist at Massachusetts General Hospital who co-led the work with Broad director Eric Lander. \u201cWe certainly couldn't have done this on a genome-wide scale before.\u201d (See  'Sequencing revolution ushers in new era' .) This advance is already unveiling new biology, says Keji Zhao of the US National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute in Bethesda, Maryland. Zhao's group has used it to decipher the messages encoded by two types of epigenetic mark produced by adding methyl groups to DNA 3 . Zhao says scientists' ability to take large-scale, complete snapshots means it might one day be possible to catalogue all the non-genetic alterations that control how genes are expressed in various cells and at all stages of development. And progress could be breakneck: Zhao's group took delivery of its first Solexa machine in January and published its results in May. Beyond epigenetics, says Lander, other ambitious projects beckon. For example, this May, the genome of genomics pioneer James Watson was bared to the world 4  after being sequenced using technology from 454 Life Sciences, a company based in Branford, Connecticut, that has just been acquired by Roche Diagnostics. This got institutions such as the US National Human Genome Research Institute thinking seriously about sequencing the complete genomes of hundreds or even thousands of people. The technology might also be used to identify new organisms, such as obscure bacteria living in complex microbial communities. But Lander cautions that all this will take a lot of work as scientists map out how best to use the latest advances. The new technologies typically read out much shorter stretches of DNA than the older generation of sequencers did. And new methods must be developed for preparing samples and assembling these short reads into whole genomes. \u201cIt's going to be a nightmare for a year or two, as we try to fit old or important applications to these strange new platforms,\u201d Lander says. \u201cBut the return is going to be tremendous.\u201d \n                     Fast sequencing comes to light \n                   \n                     Sequencers step up to the speed challenge \n                   \n                     James Watson's genome sequenced \n                   \n                     Celebrity genomes alarm researchers \n                   \n                     Genome-wide profiles of STAT1 DNA association using chromatin immunoprecipitation and massively parallel sequencing \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

IBM's announcement on 26 June that it was about to smash the 'petaflop' speed barrier could herald a new era in computing. But unless the research and computing communities get their programming act together, they risk having few scientific applications that can take advantage of this huge increase in power, say experts. Called Blue Gene/P, the first of the new high-powered computers should be operational next year, and IBM has already lined up potential customers in the United States, Germany and Britain. The largest planned configuration for the machines would run continually at 1,000 trillion floating point operations per second, or teraflops, and be capable of peak speeds of up to 3,000 teraflops (3 petaflops). That would make it between three and ten times faster than the machine that tops the latest TOP500 list of supercomputers, the IBM Blue Gene/L at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California, which peaks at 360 teraflops. \u201cI'm very excited,\u201d says Ray Bair, head of the Argonne Leadership Computing Facility at the Argonne National Laboratory in Illinois, which has worked with IBM on developing the Blue Gene/P, and which will host a version of the hardware. \u201cWe're crossing a threshold,\u201d Bair adds, claiming that the increased power will at last allow researchers to build and run models in the way they have always wanted. At prices of around $100 a gigaflop, petaflop computers will start off in the $100-million range. A great deal of the added speed that money will buy simply comes from more processors. Supercomputer designers began taking parallel processing seriously in the 1990s, but few machines have been designed to work with more than 10,000 processors. In 2005, Blue Gene/L, which is almost three times as fast as its nearest competition, marked a significant step up with 131,072 processors. A 3-petaflop Blue Gene/P will boast 884,736 \u2014 a multitude that brings with it problems as well as promise. The rapid recent growth in supercomputing power \u2014 Blue Gene/L is as powerful as the whole of 2002's TOP500 list combined \u2014 has come mostly from increases in the performance of the computer's component processors. But a few years ago that process \u201ccame to a grinding halt\u201d, says Jim Sexton, head of Blue Gene applications at IBM's Thomas J. Watson Research Center in Yorktown Heights, New York. As the processors got faster and faster, they began suffering from disproportionate increases in power consumption and heat output. To combat this, chipmakers made a historic switch. Since 2004, they have concentrated on increasing the number of processors on a chip, allowing the speed at which individual processors operate to plateau. So the dual and quad chips now common in laptops, offering two or four processors, may well be upgraded to 128 or 256 cores by 2015. This means that the cheap Linux supercomputing clusters common in universities would have hundreds of thousands of processors, and dedicated supercomputers might have hundreds of millions. The processors will not necessarily be blazingly fast \u2014 Blue Gene/P's 850-MHz chips are little faster than a Pentium III from 1999. But with their numerical advantage they won't have to be. This new reliance on parallel processing for increased performance means that companies from Microsoft to Nintendo will have to rethink their software \u2014 and so will scientists. A few scientific applications fall into the favoured subset called 'embarrassingly parallel problems'. Genome analysis using BLAST software to compare sequences and mass spectroscopy for proteomics are generally fairly easy to parallelize, says Leroy Hood, president of the Institute for Systems Biology in Seattle, Washington. Each processor can take on a specific task without much reference to what all the others are doing. But other sorts of problem, in which many of the calculations depend on other calculations being done elsewhere, are not so tractable. For the moderate levels of parallelism seen to date, it is possible to get by with the current practice of writing code, and designing models, in terms of linear sequences of instructions and then parallelizing once satisfied. To get the most out of massive parallel clusters and machines, that will no longer be an option. \u201cCoding models running across as many as a million processors is a new challenge we have to meet,\u201d says Tim Palmer of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts in Reading, UK, who is interested in petaflop machines for climate modelling. \u201cWe have no choice but to follow the hardware trends.\u201d Scientists need to shift to thinking in parallel from the outset, designing hypotheses and code accordingly, says Horst Simon, associate lab director for computing at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, California. He describes what is needed as nothing short of a \u201crevolution in scientific programming\u201d. Such a revolution has been brewing for decades, but there hasn't been much storming of the barricades. \u201cThe high-performance computing community has been working on the parallel-programming problem for over 25 years. And frankly, we don't have much to show for it,\u201d wrote Intel researcher Timothy Mattson on his company's research blog last week. \u201cOn the software front, it's chaos.\u201d Such challenges, say experts, will expose serious weaknesses in the capacities of the scientific computation community. \u201cThe scientific community is not very good at software development,\u201d says Simon. He reckons his 20-year-old son, who writes gaming software for fun, is way ahead of most scientists in addressing the challenge of parallel programming. \u201cI'm amazed at what he can do just using open-source libraries,\u201d he says. Although there are exceptions, such as high-energy physics and bioinformatics, many labs keep their software development close to their chests, for fear that their competitors will put it to better use and get the credit for the academic application of the program. There is little incentive to get the software out there, says Simon, and such attitudes plague development. One underlying reason is that in academia, software professionals are not given due recognition. \u201cWhy would you work at a low salary at a university, where the academic hotshot gets all the credit,\u201d asks Simon, \u201cwhen you could work at a gaming company, be the hotshot and get stock options?\u201d \n                     Better, faster - and easier to use \n                   \n                     Amazon puts network power online \n                   \n                     Blue Brain boots up to mixed response \n                   \n                     The Grid: Tomorrow's computing today \n                   \n                     Exploring a virtual universe \n                   \n                     2020 - Future of Computing \n                   \n                     Blue Gene/P \n                   \n                     Argonne Leadership Computing Facility \n                   \n                     National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory \n                   \n                     TOP500 supercomputer ranking \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Although there has been research into iron fertilization over the past decade, just how much carbon such blooms sequester is still unclear. A key complicating factor is that much of the resulting biomass may be converted back to carbon dioxide through grazing by other organisms. Scientists and environmentalists have also raised concerns about potential side effects, including the growth of harmful algal species and the depletion of oxygen as a result of bacterial breakdown of the phytoplankton. Planktos's plan to seed an area roughly 560 kilometres west of the Galapagos Islands would make it the first commercial company to conduct large-scale iron fertilization, although other for-profit groups are also pursuing the idea. Planktos's president, Russ George, says the experiment is designed in large part to answer the very questions raised by the advisory group. Others disagree. \u201cI think selling [the Planktos project] as research is really quite disingenuous,\u201d says David Santillo of the Greenpeace Research Laboratories in Exeter, UK. Greenpeace has campaigned against commercial iron fertilization, and George believes such efforts led to the advisory group taking up the issue. Planktos plans to release 90 tonnes of haematite, an iron-containing mineral that, although readily available as an industrial waste product, has been passed over in scientific experiments in favour of more reactive forms of the metal. The company intends to study the seeded area during the six months the bloom is expected to persist, and Planktos says it wants to involve outside scientists in the project. However, according to George, \u201ccountless false and harmful statements being presented in the world media\u201d about the company's work have made such collaborators hard to find. David Kubiak, a spokesman for Planktos, says that, in addition to gathering data, the company hopes to sell 'carbon credits' based on the Galapagos work, subject to outside verification that carbon really is being stored and not re-released. He adds that if between 2.5 million and 4.5 million tonnes of carbon were sequestered, and buyers could be found, the company might make up to $25 million. Ken Johnson, a leader of past iron-enrichment research who works at the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute in California, says the estimate is in line with the more optimistic estimates for ratios of bloom carbon to iron, but that other estimates may be two orders of magnitude lower. \u201cThe gist of it is we don't know if it's viable or not.\u201d Although Johnson is adamant that such work should be done by governments, not commercial organizations, he thinks iron fertilization should remain an option for controlling greenhouse gases if it can be made to work. \u201cIt's probably not good,\u201d he says, \u201cbut is it worse than doing nothing at all?\u201d With the issue of iron fertilization now officially raised by the advisory group's statement, the parties to the London Convention may opt to clarify related legal issues at their next meeting in London in November. Their options would include amending the convention or for signatory countries to amend their respective ocean dumping laws. Concern in the United States that the Galapagos experiment might use a non-US-flagged ship and thus avoid US regulation was what led the United States to request that the London Convention scientific group consider the issue. Dale Kemery, a spokesman for the US Environmental Protection Agency, says that, regardless of the ship used, the United States might still have jurisdiction if the iron to be released originated there. \n                     Climate change: The oresmen \n                   \n                     Iron seeding creates fleeting carbon sink in Southern Ocean \n                   \n                     Snapshot: Atlantic in bloom \n                   \n                     Climate change: Is this what it takes to save the world? \n                   \n                     Nature Reports Climate Change \n                   \n                     Climate change in focus \n                   \n                     The London Convention \n                   \n                     Planktos \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

A pioneering breed of genetically modified (GM) banana plant could reach a field site in Uganda as early as next month. The tiny plants, currently awaiting transport at the Catholic University of Leuven, Belgium, are expected to become the first GM bananas to enter field trials in Africa. Although unlikely to replace traditional varieties, they may open the door to other GM crops. The plants have been genetically modified to resist black sigatoka, a leaf spot disease caused by the fungus  Mycosphaerella fijiensis . The disease can reduce banana production by up to 50%, and so is an attractive target for genetic engineering. Lab tests show that certain genes from rice make bananas less sensitive to the disease, says Rony Swennen of the Laboratory of Tropical Crop Improvement in Leuven, where the work was done. Whether they perform equally well in the field will be tested at the Kawanda Agricultural Research Institute (KARI) of the National Agricultural Research Organisation, based in Kampala. The fruit, like most cultivated bananas, are sterile, which will keep the genes from spreading to other plants. After India, Uganda is the world's biggest grower of bananas and plantains, producing 10 million tonnes a year for eating or to make beer. Relatively few of these bananas are of the bogoya dessert variety tested in the Belgian lab \u2014 but the same genes may protect them, too. In fact, the genes may reach Uganda before the bananas: Swennen plans to send the relevant DNA constructs to KARI soon, but the bananas must wait for formal approval from the government. The KARI researchers plan to use the genes to modify highland (cooking) bananas, which are a more important food staple. They also want to improve the highland banana's food value. \u201cWe are trying to increase the vitamin A and iron content,\u201d says Geoffrey Arinaitwe, a Belgium-trained Ugandan researcher working at KARI. \u201cThe main goal of the project with the bogoya dessert banana is capability building in Uganda,\u201d adds Swennen, \u201cso that trained local people can do the work themselves.\u201d The Ugandan project is not the only one aimed at black sigatoka. \u201cWe are developing bananas with black sigatoka resistance too,\u201d says Eli Khayat, vice-president of research at Rahan Meristem, a biotech firm in Western Galilee, Israel. \u201cBut we would probably test them in Central America. Treatments against black sigatoka can cost US$1,600 per hectare in Costa Rica.\u201d The Ugandan project receives help and training from the Agricultural Biotechnology Support Project, an international consortium led by Cornell University. The project is funded by the US Agency for International Development \u2014 which also finances a programme advising and supporting the Ugandan government in setting up biotech research projects.\u201cThese two big American projects came in with basically one objective: to get GM bananas in the field as fast as possible,\u201d says Richard Markham of Rome-based Bioversity International, a non-governmental organization that oversees several banana projects and helped start the Belgian black sigatoka project. The trials may not draw the public protest that sometimes accompanies GM trials in Europe and elsewhere. \u201cPeople have more pressing concerns, like the rebellion in the north, AIDS, droughts and poverty,\u201d says Markham. \u201cSome consumer groups strongly oppose GM organisms,\u201d adds Godber Tumushabe of the Advocates Coalition for Development and Environment, a Kampala-based think-tank. \u201cBut the debate in Uganda has died down in recent years. When field trials begin, it could start again.\u201d Whatever its reception, the banana project still has a long way to go. But it may have smoothed the path for other GM crops.

The French National AIDS Council (CNS), an independent government advisory body on AIDS issues, last week urged prudence in implementing male-circumcision programmes to reduce the spread of HIV. It cautioned that over-zealous roll out could lead to a false sense of security and exacerbate the problem. In March, the World Health Organization (WHO) endorsed the promotion of male circumcision as a tool for HIV prevention, alongside condoms and antiretroviral drugs. The move was based on a WHO expert consultation, which concluded that the evidence for the intervention's efficacy was \u201ccompelling\u201d. Recent criticism of this view has been received with anger (see  'Cutting criticism' ). The strongest evidence comes from three recent studies. In 2005, a study 1  of 3,300 heterosexual men living in and around Orange Farm, South Africa, by France's National AIDS Research Agency, showed that circumcising men reduced the risk of infection by 60%. Similar levels of protection were found in 2007 by American-funded studies in Kisumu 2 , Kenya, and Rakai 3 , Uganda. Taken together with results from observational studies, this is \u201cas convincing evidence as one ever gets in public health,\u201d says Helen Weiss, a statistical epidemiologist at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine. But questions remain about the intervention's applicability as a preventative tool on a large scale, says Willy Rozenbaum of the Pierre and Marie Curie University in Paris, who led the CNS study. Rozenbaum questions the speed with which the WHO has acted, and thinks the organization's endorsement \u2014 although detailing the caveats \u2014 has been misunderstood in some quarters as saying circumcision is a \u201cmiracle solution\u201d. Rozenbaum notes that the effect of circumcision on HIV prevalence in a population will depend on a host of social and cultural factors. There is a real risk, he says, that after circumcision men may have a false sense of security and increase their number of partners, or dispense with condoms. The report also points out that circumcision leaves men more vulnerable to infection if they don't refrain from having sex until the wounds have fully healed and that women may find it more difficult to insist on condom use with circumcised men. Given these concerns, the CNS calls for implementation schemes to be accompanied by public education as well as research that considers the behavioural and cultural factors that affect HIV transmission. Such research is already under way at various sites. At Orange Farm, a 5-year follow-up study of 30,000 people will look at how the implementation of a real circumcision campaign affects risk behaviours, and overall HIV prevalence in the population. Tim Farley, an official in the WHO's HIV prevention team in Geneva, says he \u201cabsolutely agrees\u201d with the CNS view, and the need for such research. \u201cThese are concerns that need to be studied, but they are not a reason to stop,\u201d he says. \u201cWe must move ahead in the knowledge that there could be riskier behaviour.\u201d \n                     UN advice: circumcise to prevent HIV \n                   \n                     Trio of studies makes headway in HIV battle \n                   \n                     AIDS: On the Brink \n                   \n                     AIDS meeting urged to rethink prevention strategy \n                   \n                     Cutting the risk of HIV \n                   \n                     CNS opinion and report \n                   \n                     English version available soon at \n                   \n                     WHO and UNAIDS recommendations on male circumcision for HIV prevention \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

America's National Cancer Institute (NCI) has confirmed that its much-heralded cancer genome atlas is off to a slow start. And scientists say that the obstacles facing the project are just a taste of those that will soon confront all researchers who use large-scale methods to analyse material from tissue banks. Nine months ago, US National Institutes of Health director Elias Zerhouni announced the \u201cscientific start\u201d of the Cancer Genome Atlas, which aims to catalogue the genetic characteristics of various cancers at a previously impossible level of detail. The project was controversial even before it started, with some scientists afraid that it would divert resources from investigator-initiated research in tight budget times (see  Nature   438 , 894; 2005). But it prevailed, thanks in part to strong support from Francis Collins, director of the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) in Bethesda, Maryland. Now, the NCI has confirmed that the project stumbled as soon as it left the starting blocks. The problem lies with brain-cancer samples, which are removed surgically from patients and stored at a tumour bank at the MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, Texas. The centre was chosen to provide the Cancer Genome Atlas with samples of glioblastoma multiforme \u2014 a type of brain cancer that is almost always fatal. Glioblastoma is one of three cancers that will be analysed in the atlas's US$100-million three-year pilot programme, which is funded jointly by the NCI and the NHGRI. The other two diseases being analysed are lung and ovarian cancers. The pilot aims to analyse at least 500 samples of each cancer. But this February, when scientists started to retrieve tissue samples from the bank, \u201cwe started realizing the scene wasn't as rosy as we had hoped\u201d, says Carolyn Compton, director of biorepositories and biospecimen research at the NCI. So far, the project has analysed fewer than half the number expected because about half of the samples at the MD Anderson bank haven't met the project's stringent quality tests, according to cancer geneticist Ronald DePinho from Harvard Medical School in Boston, Massachusetts, who is co-chair of the atlas's external scientific committee. Compton and other scientists say this problem isn't unique to the MD Anderson tumour bank. Variable sample quality is a concern with all tissue banks, scientists say, because every bank has its own standards, and samples aren't usually checked for quality until someone needs them for a project. \u201cWe haven't had the large number of samples we expected,\u201d says Lynda Chin, a cancer geneticist at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston, Massachusetts, and co-head of one of the atlas's seven Cancer Genome Characterization Centers. \u201cBut this is the reality of the limitations of the existing tissue banks.\u201d The Cancer Genome Atlas set high standards for its samples to ensure high-quality data. All the samples included in the project must have at least 80% viable cells, because the project is analysing DNA and RNA only from live cells. The samples also have to be quite large \u2014 weighing at least 200 milligrams \u2014 because the tissue has to be shared between the many analysis centres involved in the project. The high standards are part of the reason that the project stumbled with the glioblastoma samples. Glioblastoma tumours tend to be spread throughout the brain, and must by definition contain necrotic, or dead, tissue. So scientists expected that some tumours from the MD Anderson bank would contain too much necrotic tissue to meet their criteria \u2014 but not this many. The failure of so many samples has prompted the Cancer Genome Atlas to expand its criteria to admit brain-cancer samples with more necrotic tissue. It has also started to take samples from brain tumour banks at the Henry Ford Health System in Detroit, Michigan, and the University of California, San Francisco. Compton says that the lung and ovarian cancer projects shouldn't have the same problems as the one for glioblastoma, because those tumours tend to be larger. She still hopes that the pilot project will complete its work in the scheduled three years. But changing the criteria for glioblastoma samples won't solve the bigger problems with tissue banking. Foremost among them is how the procedures used in tissue banking affect the nucleic acids and proteins in the stored samples. For instance, it's not clear how anaesthesia affects gene expression during surgery to remove tumours, Compton says. That could mean that signatures gleaned from banked tissues might just be by-products of procedures used in surgery and storage \u2014 not markers of disease processes. \u201cThe state of the science right now is pathetic,\u201d Compton says. Because the science is so poor, the NCI has decided, for the first time, to fund studies on biospecimen banking. On 28 June, Compton is scheduled to present the agency's biospecimen research plan to its board of scientific advisers. If it is approved, the NCI will award scientists money to study how collection and banking processes affect the nucleic acids and proteins embedded within tissue samples. The NCI is also working with research agencies around the world to try to encourage tissue banks everywhere to adopt uniform standards. Researchers in many countries are grappling with the same problem. The International Agency for Research on Cancer, a World Health Organization body based in Lyon, France, with 20 member states, is also trying to address it. In the meantime, DePinho insists that the Cancer Genome Atlas is doing well for a new venture of its scope. \u201cThis is an extraordinarily difficult project, so these hiccoughs at the embryonic stage are to be expected,\u201d he says. \n                     Pricey cancer genome project struggles with sample shortage \n                   \n                     After criticism, more modest cancer genome project takes shape \n                   \n                     Big money for cancer genomics \n                   \n                     AACR blog \n                   \n                     Cancer genomics web focus \n                   \n                     The Cancer Genome Atlas \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Although these factors contributed, they say, the UN overstates the case. The 358-page Sudan Post-Conflict Environmental Assessment, released on 22 June by the UN Environmental Programme, is in the main a comprehensive treatise on environmental management. \u201cIt seems to have been thoughtfully and professionally done,\u201d says Martha Saavedra, associate director of the Center for African Studies at the University of California, Berkeley. But like many experts, Saavedra questions the UN's spin, which has played up the role of environmental degradation. Ban Ki-moon, UN Secretary-General, stressed this theme in a 16 June article in the  Washington Post  entitled \u201cA Climate Culprit In Darfur\u201d. His piece painted a tragic picture of resource scarcity triggering conflict between herders and settled farmers who had previously coexisted peacefully. \u201cAlmost invariably, we discuss Darfur in a convenient military and political shorthand \u2014 an ethnic conflict pitting Arab militias against black rebels and farmers,\u201d Ban wrote. \u201cLook to its roots, though, and you discover a more complex dynamic. Amid the diverse social and political causes, the Darfur conflict began as an ecological crisis, arising at least in part from climate change.\u201d Alex de Waal, an expert on Darfur at the Social Science Research Council in New York, agrees that the dynamic is complex \u2014 and warns that the environmental argument, too, raises \u201ca danger of oversimplifying Darfur.\u201d Darfurians have adapted to environmental change for centuries, he points out. \u201cOver the past thirty years, change has occurred at a faster pace and on a larger scale,\u201d he says. \u201cBut depleted natural resources and livelihood transformations cannot on their own account for armed conflict.\u201d The true culprit in Darfur is the National Islamic Front, which came to power in Khartoum in a military coup in 1989. It was bent on expanding its political base though ethnic cleansing, using terror as a tactic, says Eric Reeves, an analyst of Sudan at Smith College in Northampton, Massachusetts. \u201cThis is not about competition over resources.\u201d \u201cThere will always be conflict, but having good, regular conflict regulating and resolution mechanisms \u2014 legitimate governing systems \u2014 is key,\u201d agrees Saavedra, adding that although these issues are referred to in the report, the political issues that lie at the heart of the conflict are sidestepped. A version of the Darfur conflict would have occurred whatever the environmental changes, says Reeves, adding that they cannot be used as an alibi for the international community's failure to prevent the genocide. \u201cYou don't have a diminishment in rain, and then an uncontrolled genocidal conflict; this just doesn't correspond to the political realities in Darfur.\u201d \n                     BrightEarth project shows up dark deeds \n                   \n                     Climate Change 2007: How to survive a warming world \n                   \n                     Climate change in focus \n                   \n                     Sudan Post-Conflict Environmental Assessment \n                   \n                     Ban Ki-Moon in The Washington Post \n                   \n                     Social Science Research Council's Darfur blog \n                   \n                     Eric Reeve's Darfur Website \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

An ambitious programme aimed at freeing up Earth-science data for researchers and educators worldwide will be launched next week at the quadrennial meeting of the International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics in Perugia, Italy. It is one of several efforts by geoscientists to improve access to geophysical data on the web. Called the Electronic Geophysical Year (eGY), the programme has been organized by a broad range of researchers and organizations and will promote the creation of virtual observatories to make geophysical data easier to find and use. It takes its inspiration from the fiftieth anniversary of the 1957 International Geophysical Year, which was the first concerted effort to understand the Earth as a physical system. Sharing and transferring data is much easier than it was during the original International Geophysical Year. But because different research groups often have data stored in incompatible formats, researchers can't always combine the various sources for study. Efforts to transfer historical data languishing in archives from deteriorating paper to accessible digital formats are piecemeal and require prioritization. One of eGY's goals is to overcome such hurdles, in part through the use of virtual observatories that will serve as clearinghouses for scientific collections. \u201cThis is the forefront of information technology: to standardize computer-language syntax,\u201d says William Peterson, a physicist at the University of Colorado in Boulder and an eGY organizer. \u201cWe hope to build layers of software so anyone can display and integrate data in different forms.\u201d On 12\u201315 June, around 75 researchers from around the world attended the Virtual Observatories in Geosciences conference in Denver, Colorado, to plot this course. A case in point, says Jeffrey Love, a geomagnetist at the US Geological Survey office in Denver, are records of Earth's magnetic field that extend back to the nineteenth century. Decades-old data originally gathered to help marine navigation at labs in Maryland, Hawaii and Alaska are now of interest to scientists studying magnetic storms in Earth's magnetosphere that occur as a result of solar activity. \u201cIt is a daunting task,\u201d says Love, \u201cmaking sure people know what they have and should save.\u201d Other international efforts are aimed at collecting new data. One part of the current International Heliophysical Year is a concerted effort to extend low-cost data-collection systems to developing nations. In Africa, for instance, 35 nations have agreed to the installation of special Global Positioning System pods. These use the signals from navigation satellites to measure electron density in the ionosphere (where the atmosphere meets space). Such monitoring is widespread in the United States, Europe and Latin America, but data for Africa are weak, says Joseph Davila, a physicist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, who is leading the effort. Last week, Davila was in Libya helping to install a radio receiver at the University of Sheba, south of Tripoli, as part of AWESOME (Atmospheric Weather Electromagnetic System for Observation, Modeling and Education), another ionospheric monitoring project. In 2008, the United Nations-sponsored Year of Planet Earth will be looking at similar efforts to further its goal of promoting \u201cEarth Sciences for Society\u201d. Eduardo de Mulder of the Geological Survey of the Netherlands in Utrecht, a leader on the Planet Earth project, says the organization is trying to raise at least US$5 million to fund international efforts that would include 60 nations. Scientists are applying for grants from this pool of funds, with the first awards expected late this year. Among the project's main efforts will be an annotated geological map of the world, onegeology.com, that would provide access to all sorts of data. \u201cIt would be a living process,\u201d says de Mulder, \u201cwith the public and governments using the Earth science information to make better policy decisions.\u201d \n                     Polar research: The new face of the Arctic \n                   \n                     Electronic Geophysical Year \n                   \n                     International Heliophysical Year \n                   \n                     Planet Earth 2007-2009 \n                   \n                     World Data Center \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Congress is losing its appetite for the Reliable Replacement Warhead (RRW), a nuclear bomb conceived as a way to allow weapons physicists to ply their trade in a weapons-ban world. Instead, Capitol Hill is calling for a full review of the US nuclear programme. After its 4 July recess, the House of Representatives will vote on a bill that would eliminate funding for the RRW from the 2008 budget. The Bush administration had requested $89 million for the project. And committees in both the House and the Senate are drafting legislation that would limit work on the new design to feasibility and cost assessments. That legislation would also call for a review of the need for nuclear weapons. Until last autumn, the RRW programme enjoyed bipartisan, if tentative, support in Congress. The project, which aims to design a weapon more robust than its predecessors but that requires no testing (see  Nature   442 , 18\u201321; 2006), was seen by congressional appropriators as a way to cut the cost of maintaining the nuclear stockpile. Some also liked the idea that it could reduce the size of the stockpile. But a costly plan released in December on the future of the nuclear weapons complex suggested it would be hard to realize any savings from the RRW. And a study showing that existing warheads will last for at least another 50 years (see  Nature   444 , 660\u2013661; doi:10.1038/444660a 2006 ) made the new bomb seem less necessary. Billions have been spent on 'stockpile stewardship' to prolong the lives of current warheads, Congressman Pete Visclosky (Democrat, Indiana) said on 19 June. Now, he said, \u201cWe are told: 'Let's do something else'.\u201d \u201cI don't think it is asking too much for a comprehensive nuclear strategy before we build a new nuclear weapon,\u201d added Visclosky, who chairs the subcommittee that withdrew the RRW funding. A separate defence bill working its way through Congress might provide such a strategy. Versions of the authorization bill, which would set out policy but not funding, call for a comprehensive review of US nuclear policy. This would assess whether the size of the stockpile is appropriate in the post-cold-war era and whether an RRW would be necessary for a credible deterrent. Arms-control advocates are elated by the move. \u201cWhat Congress has done is really stunning,\u201d says Philip Coyle, a senior adviser at the Center for Defense Information, a think-tank in Washington DC. The current US stockpile is far too bloated, he adds. But supporters of the RRW say that Congress has undercut the weapons programme. Expertise will be lost unless a new generation can design weapons, says Paul Robinson, former director of Sandia National Laboratories in Albuquerque, New Mexico. He notes that the House budget for nuclear weapons is also $400 million lower than that enacted for 2007. \u201cI feel absolutely sure that members of Congress have not looked at the strategic consequences of what they are doing,\u201d he says. The RRW is not done yet. This week, the Senate begins drafting its own version of the appropriations bill. Senator Pete Domenici (Republican, New Mexico) has vowed to win back support for the programme. A final version of the bill, to be worked out between the House and Senate, is expected sometime in the autumn. \n                     US backs revamp of nuclear warheads \n                   \n                     Nuclear weapons: The next nuke \n                   \n                     Rich in plutonium \n                   \n                     Bush buries US bunker-buster project \n                   \n                     NNSA Fact Sheet on the RRW \n                   \n                     Summary of House Energy and Water Bill \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

On  page 1003  of this issue, palaeontologist John Wible of the Carnegie Museum of Natural History in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and his colleagues use their discovery of a Cretaceous mammal from Mongolia to build the most complete fossil-based mammal family tree so far. It suggests that modern mammals arose only after the dinosaurs went extinct 65 million years ago, thus contradicting dates derived from the DNA of living mammals \u2014 including another recent  Nature  paper (O. R. Bininda-Edwards  et al . 406, 507\u2013512; 2007). In the DNA analyses, modern groups appear earlier, between 100 and 80 million years ago, with the extinction of the dinosaurs seeming to have had little effect on their evolution. Yawning gaps between molecular and palaeontological approaches to the dating of evolutionary landmarks have appeared ever since molecular approaches based on DNA sequences first became widely used about 15 years ago. When results differ, the molecular technique almost always pushes events further back than the fossil record. For example, some molecular studies estimate that multicellular animals arose about a billion years ago, but the fossil record goes back a mere 600 million years. Fossil plant spores date back 475 million years, but molecular dates put plants on land 700 million years ago. However, there are signs that this deep-running discord may be being resolved, at least in some cases. \u201cTen years ago the divide looked very sharp,\u201d says palaeontologist Mike Benton of the University of Bristol, UK. \u201cBut there's been a certain amount of movement both ways \u2014 palaeontological and molecular people are moving towards one another.\u201d That molecular dates are a little earlier is to be expected. DNA should record the moment that a lineage split, but the imperfections of the fossil record mean that the first preserved post-split organisms will date from later on. And there are some groups \u2014 such as the microscopic, soft-bodied animals that make up about half the extant animal phyla \u2014 that have no fossil record at all. \u201cWe should be willing to accept biases in the fossil record regarding certain types of animal,\u201d says Blair Hedges of Pennsylvania State University in University Park. Hedges has been among the most vigorous advocates of earlier DNA dates for major evolutionary splits, including those that produced the animals, the land plants, the fungi and mammals. But although Kevin Peterson of Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire, agrees that some groups' fossil records are too patchy to be trusted, he is scathing of the notion that the first animals could have gone unfossilized for nearly half a billion years. \u201cTo say that because the record is incomplete you can have a billion-year-old bilaterian is a woeful misunderstanding of the fossil record,\u201d he says. DNA clocks have their own problems, which can cause overestimates of the age of evolutionary splits. Different genes can evolve at different rates, and the calibration of DNA clocks must be handled carefully. A calibration that involves a slowly evolving lineage can throw a whole tree off. Benton sees hope in new statistical methods that can better account for uncertainty in both the timing of calibration points and measurements of evolutionary rates. In such treatments, both fossil and molecular dates go from being fixed points with error bars to being a range of probabilities. \u201cThe flexibility is hugely liberating,\u201d says Benton. \u201cI see a glowing future for this.\u201d Using such an approach, Peterson has obtained molecular dates for the origin of the animals that match their first appearance in the fossil record (K. J. Peterson & N. J. Butterfield,  Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA   102,  9547\u20139552; 2005). He presented his latest analyses this week at a meeting at the Royal Society in London. \u201cAll of the latest estimates are putting the division of the bilateria right in the Ediacaran,\u201d he says, referring to the geological period pre-dating the Cambrian explosion of about 540 million years ago. A group led by Emmanuel Douzery at the University of Montpelier in France has got similar results in the past few years. Hedges argues, however, that these more recent dates are the result of calibration errors. The mammals look to be a tougher nut to crack. \u201cI don't have a good answer as to why there's this discrepancy,\u201d says Wible, \u201cbut I doubt our work is the final answer.\u201d He is part of a project funded by the US National Science Foundation to combine molecular and morphological data to build the most complete mammal tree so far. \u201cWe need to marry the data sets together,\u201d he says. \u201cOnly this type of analysis can address these major problems.\u201d See News & Views,  \n                     page 918 \n                   . \n                     Polar research: The new face of the Arctic \n                   \n                     Electronic Geophysical Year \n                   \n                     International Heliophysical Year \n                   \n                     Planet Earth 2007-2009 \n                   \n                     World Data Center \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Emma Marris steps through the looking glass to profile the result. In 2006, a federal appeals court was called on to examine the way that the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) was proposing to regulate power-plant emissions. Congress had decreed that regulations should be revisited after \u201cany physical change\u201d that increases emissions. The EPA and counsel for various industries argued that if the word \u201cany\u201d was construed properly, old power plants could have their equipment significantly revamped without \u201cany physical change\u201d taking place, and that if Congress had wanted to address such cases it would have spelled things out more clearly. The court was having none of it: \u201cOnly in a Humpty-Dumpty world would Congress be required to use superfluous words while an agency could ignore an expansive word that Congress did use. We decline to adopt such a world-view.\u201d The ruling resonated with a great deal of the criticism of the EPA under the George W. Bush administration; many environmentalists hold that if the agency could indeed, like Humpty Dumpty in Lewis Carroll's  Through the Looking Glass , make words mean what it wanted them to mean, then an awful lot of words would end up meaning \u201cOK, pollute a bit if you must.\u201d \n               Outweighing benefits \n             The EPA's remit means it will never be a stranger to criticism. A draft report by the White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB) put the annual costs of government regulation over the past ten years at between $39 billion and $46 billion in 2001 dollars, around 60% of which was attributable to EPA regulations. As a result, the agency regularly gets flak from those facing those costs, mainly industries. The same report, though, calculates the benefits of regulation at $98 billion to $480 billion, with about 85% attributable to the EPA. If the EPA is already doing that much good, environmentalists argue that it could do even better by regulating more stringently. The agency has been attacked from both sides since it was founded in 1970. But things have been particularly tough and one-sided over the past six years, during which time the agency has endured a constant, low-level rumbling of scandal. Standards for smog were called deadly and rules for mercury too lenient; enforcement changes a gift to the coal industry before the 2004 elections; and much more. All this comes as the EPA faces what is arguably the biggest challenge in its history: regulating the main gases that cause climate change. The agency had until recently claimed that, when words meant what it wanted them to mean, carbon dioxide did not count as pollution, and thus did not come under its remit. This April, the Supreme Court told the agency that that wasn't going to wash. Carbon dioxide now needs to be assessed as a factor in regulating car emissions. The case marked a victory for California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, among others, who have been keen to regulate along these lines but was stymied by the EPA's stance. Most of the climate-change bills currently swirling around Washington lay out a cap-and-trade system to restrict greenhouse-gas emissions. And nearly all of them specify the EPA as the lead agency. This is in part because the sulphur-trading scheme that the EPA set up in the 1990s as a market-based approach to controlling acid rain is widely admired. Under the current administration, though, the emphasis has not been on innovative regulation but on less regulation, with a reliance on voluntary approaches and a close, trusting relationship with the regulated industries. The Bush administration has a record of pushing its legal authority as far as it can to influence its agencies in their interpretation of statutes, and it has done so vigorously at the EPA; hence the overturns in the courts. President Bush has been served by three EPA administrators. The first, former governor of New Jersey Christine Todd Whitman, had the highest profile. She resigned in 2003, apparently frustrated with meddling from the White House, where Vice-President Dick Cheney's work on energy policy was hard to square with her environmental agenda. The most recent administrator, Stephen Johnson, an agency veteran and the first career scientist to rise to the level of administrator, has kept a lower profile. Russell Train, who served as agency head under the Republican presidents Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford, says he feels that the EPA has \u201clost its way\u201d under Bush. Train, now at the conservation group WWF in Washington DC, says that in his day the EPA was on a longer leash. \u201cNever ever once was I ever told by anybody \u2014 either in the White House or purporting to speak for the White House \u2014 how to make a decision or how to reach a decision.\u201d \n               Balanced interests \n             The White House seems to exert considerable influence over the EPA's decisions. It has, for example, expanded the power of the OMB, which must approve all new regulations and standards. Another White House office, the Council for Environmental Quality (CEQ), coordinates federal environmental policy and can put the kibosh on any agency plans that run foul of other departments' priorities or the president's agenda. James Connaughton, head of the CEQ, says that people not involved in the interagency process don't realize that interests have to be balanced across the government. \u201cFrom the pure environmental perspective I would have recommended one approach, but from the economics another approach would be indicated. And that is rational,\u201d he says. One long-term career employee, who asked not to be named because she is still with the agency, describes the growing clout of the White House: \u201cWe used to have knock-down fights with [the OMB], but it is not that way anymore,\u201d she says. \u201cOur leaders do not fight back. We basically take our marching orders.\u201d Insiders point to the Office of Air and Radiation \u2014 one of the largest departments in the agency \u2014 as a case study of Bush appointees doing as the White House says. In 2001, Jeff Holmstead was recruited to run the 'air office', as it is known. He previously represented came from Latham & Watkins, a Los Angeles-based law firm that represents chemical and electronics manufacturers, among others. Holmstead and his deputy Bill Wehrum (who had worked for the same firm) were responsible for the Clean Air Interstate Rule, which caps some pollutants from power plants in eastern states, and for the non-road diesel rule, which limits nitrous oxide and soot emissions from construction equipment and the like. Johnson has described these regulations as \u201ctwo of the five most health-protective clean-air rules in EPA's history\u201d. And they have significantly cut down on emissions. The OMB calculates that the air office produces benefits of $60 billion to $410 billion for costs of between $19 billion and $22 billion. But Holmstead and Wehrum angered many of the staff when in 2003 they proposed changes that would keep many older power plants from having to adopt modern pollution standards when they remodel. These were the changes eventually over-ruled on the basis of their Humpty-Dumpty approach to language. Bruce Buckheit, head of air enforcement under Holmstead, resigned in protest at the way the rules forestalled planned action against polluters. Now an environmental consultant and sailing instructor in Virginia, he says that the White House was running the show. \u201cBasically Jeff Holmstead and Bill Wehrum would go and meet with Jim Connaughton and come back with their orders,\u201d he says. \n               Independent thinking \n             Holmstead, who has worked at the law firm Bracewell & Giuliani in Houston since leaving the agency in 2005, denies the charge: \u201cI never had direction from the vice-president's office or the CEQ about what line to take.\u201d He adds that he cared more about getting things done than pleasing environmentalists. \u201cSome people say that industry got more of what they wanted under [this administration] than under the Clinton administration \u2014 but just because industry promotes something doesn't mean it is wrong.\u201d On Holmstead's departure, Wehrum took over as acting director of the air office and was nominated to take the job on permanently. But in April the White House withdrew the nomination, as the Democrats began sharpening their knives for the hearing at which they could question him before confirming or rejecting his nomination. Wehrum resigned on 1 June. Speaking to  Nature  in his last week on the job, he said that his goal while in office was to hit that \u201csweet spot\u201d where industry and environmentalists can both be happy. \u201cWhat we have tried to do is to be as smart as we possibly can and get the most bang for the buck,\u201d says Wehrum. In January 2009, it seems fairly certain that a new president, even if a Republican, will appoint a new EPA administrator \u2014 someone who will probably have to take on the daunting task of regulating carbon dioxide, and will have a demoralized agency staff with which to do so. But the challenge may well help that morale. When the Supreme Court made its decision this April, champagne corks were heard to pop discreetly in some parts of the agency's Pennsylvania-Avenue headquarters. \u201cIt has been a real morale booster,\u201d says the career employee, looking to the future. \u201cMy immediate supervisor says I have got to stay so we can put it all back together.\u201d See Editorial,  \n                     page 886 \n                   . \n                     Online resources threaten livelihood of libraries \n                   \n                     Car emissions are EPA's problem \n                   \n                     The politics of breathing \n                   \n                     Climate in court \n                   \n                     New Orleans cleared of 'toxic soup' scenario \n                   \n                     Climate Change in Focus \n                   \n                     EPA \n                   \n                     NRDC Air Page \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

The Iranian judiciary has said it will decide this week whether to indict the imprisoned scholars on charges of espionage and threatening national security. Last month, the country's intelligence ministry warned Iranian academics and scientists that contact with foreign institutions, or attendance of international conferences, could result in their being considered spies. Haleh Esfandiari, the 67-year-old director of the Middle East Program at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in Washington DC, and Ali Shakeri, a founder of the University of California's Center for Citizen Peacebuilding, were arrested on 8 May. Kian Tajbakhsh, a researcher working on humanitarian issues with the Open Society Institute, based in New York, was arrested three days later. The three are being held in Tehran's Evin Prison, long notorious for the torture of political prisoners. Their incarceration has triggered protests from academic and human-rights organizations worldwide, including the American Association for the Advancement of Science, Amnesty International, the American Association of University Professors, Human Rights Watch, and Scholars at Risk. The broader implications of these developments have not been lost. The arrests \u201craise grave concerns about the ability of internationally recognized scholars and intellectuals to safely visit Iran,\u201d notes Scholars at Risk, an international network of universities and colleges that seeks to defend the human rights of academics around the world. The organization thinks they signal a \u201cwider attempt to intimidate intellectuals and to limit academic freedom in Iran.\u201d The crackdown is already having a \u201cchilling effect\u201d on international collaboration, says Fatemeh Haghighatjoo, an Iranian psychologist and visiting fellow at Harvard's John F. Kennedy School of Government. She likens it to the repression of foreign contacts in the Soviet Union at the height of the Cold War. For the moment, researchers in the natural sciences seem to be less affected than their social-science colleagues. Haghighatjoo, a reformist former member of parliament and a renowned human-rights advocate, says academics who deal with Iran's social, cultural or political situation are at the most risk. Yousef Sobouti, an astrophysicist and director of the Institute for Advanced Studies in Basic Sciences (IASBS) in Zanjan, Iran, seems to confirm as much when he says he has never encountered difficulties with the regime. \u201cJust today, I signed letters for eight of our students and faculty members to attend conferences in countries ranging from Japan, Russia to Europe and the United States.\u201d Reza Mansouri, a physicist at Sharif University of Technology in Tehran, and a deputy science minister under reformist former president Mohammad Khatami, is similarly sanguine. He shrugs off the intelligence ministry's threat as a warning \u2014 aimed mainly at naive younger researchers \u2014 to be vigilant in all dealings with the West. Mansouri says Iranian academics have long been targeted by foreign intelligence services, and claims such efforts have increased recently. \u201cIntelligence agents have tried hard to contact Iranian scientists visiting research institutions abroad, or attending conferences,\u201d he says, \u201cwith the very obvious goal of having intelligence information about Iran\u201d. Some stories of such approaches are \u201cunfortunately true,\u201d agrees David Rahni, an Iranian-born chemist at Pace University in New York. But Rahni is less cool than physical scientists  Nature  spoke to in Iran about the impact of recent events. He says they will make colleagues in Iran \u201cthink twice about communicating; it will have a negative impact on the country's science\u201d. For Haghighatjoo, the regime is rolling back years of slow progress on the opening up to the outside world undertaken by presidents Rafsanjani and Khatami. Of 20 Iranians she invited to a recent workshop on the future of democracy in Iran at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, only two showed up, she says, with the others declining for fear of retribution or after the Iranian security services forbid them to attend. But, like other academics, Haghighatjoo dismisses the idea that the crackdown represents a return to the anti-science, anti-academic years that followed the inception of the current Iranian theocracy in the 1979 revolution. She sees it more as a tactical response to current international and domestic politics. President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's government is increasingly unpopular at home, risking defeat in next year's parliamentary elections and in the presidential elections of 2009. The current repression, says Haghighatjoo, is not like the purge of university liberals that followed Ahmandinejad's 2005 election. It is simply that of a regime clinging on to power through \u201czero tolerance of any dissent\u201d and is targeting any opposition, including that from conservatives, that threatens its grip. And the United States has made no secret of the fact that it is spending millions to encourage some of the forms of dissent under attack, under the rubric of \u201cpro-democracy support\u201d. Haghighatjoo, along with many academic and human-rights groups, sees this as both incomprehensible and counterproductive, playing into the hands of the regime by providing a pretext to attack independent pro-democracy groups and academic reformers. \u201cHow can we as Americans spend millions of dollars to effectuate covert or overt actions against a sovereign government, and expect them to take that crap sitting down?\u201d says Rahni. Esfandiari's husband, Shaul Bakhash, himself an academic expert on Iran, has also attacked the policy: \u201cLoose talk of regime change and allocation of money supposed to advance democracy in Iran has done a great deal of harm to Iranian academics, intellectuals and researchers,\u201d he told the  Financial Times . \u201cIt also feeds the paranoia of the Iranian regime of American intentions.\u201d See Editorial,  \n                     page 886 \n                   . \n                     Venezuelan free-speech row goes nuclear \n                   \n                     Islam and Science: Q&A The reformer \n                   \n                     Forgotten plights \n                   \n                     French confusion leaves Iranians locked out of meeting \n                   \n                     Turkish rectors rally in support of university head thrown in jail \n                   \n                     Islam and Science \n                   \n                     AIDS medics in Libya \n                   \n                     Podcast interview with Reza Mansouri \n                   \n                     'Free Haleh' support website \n                   \n                     Center for Citizen Peacebuilding \n                   \n                     Open Society Institute \n                   \n                     AAAS Human Rights Action Network \n                   \n                     Amnesty International \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

The decision follows an unfavourable evaluation of the Darwin bid by the International Council on Monuments and Sites (ICOMOS), which advises UNESCO's World Heritage Committee on aspects of cultural heritage. The government says that the evaluation, which has not been made public, questioned the integrity, authenticity and value of the proposed site. In an open letter to the director of the World Heritage Committee, the UK's Department of Culture, Media and Sport described this assessment as \u201cfundamentally flawed\u201d with \u201cserious weaknesses and omissions\u201d. But proposed sites have only one chance with the committee. Fearing the ICOMOS report might sway the decision, the government chose not to let the Darwin nomination go before the committee, which meets on 23 June in Christchurch, New Zealand, to decide on new sites (see  'Natural wonders' ). A new Darwin proposal will be submitted in two years' time. This year's 'Darwin at Downe' proposal sought to put a World Heritage ring around 1,000 hectares of countryside in and around the village of Downe on the outskirts of London. At its heart is Down House, Darwin's home from 1842 until his death in 1882. The surrounding landscape fed Darwin's mind as he wrote  The Origin of Species  and later works: he studied orchids at Downe Bank, found insectivorous plants on Keston Common and collected seeds for his experiments at Cudham School pond. \u201cI can't think of anything more important to do for the history of nineteenth-century science than to protect the whole environment Darwin inhabited and exploited,\u201d says James Moore, a Darwin scholar at the Open University in Milton Keynes and one of the first historians to explore the importance of this rural refuge to Darwin. \u201cMuslims go to Mecca, Christians go to Jerusalem, Darwinians go to Downe,\u201d he says. But without natural wonders or spectacular architecture, Darwin at Downe does not tick obvious World Heritage boxes. Although he was surprised to hear of Downe's difficulties, Geoffrey Belcher, site coordinator for the Maritime Greenwich World Heritage Site in London, thinks that \u201cA site with a limited range of qualities will be at a disadvantage.\u201d The inclusion of the Royal Observatory makes Greenwich one of the few World Heritage Sites to celebrate science, but the site boasts architectural splendour and naval history too. \u201cThis doesn't look like other World Heritage sites,\u201d admits Randal Keynes, Darwin's great-great grandson and author of the Darwin at Downe nomination. But he defends its value as testimony to \u201cthe understanding of the natural world by observation, hypothesis, experiment, free and wide exchange of information and ideas, theory-building and communication.\u201d \n               Values in question \n             In 2005 the World Heritage Committee called for \u201cnominations which recognize and celebrate achievements in science\u201d, which seemed to make the Darwin at Downe proposal timely. But along with questioning the integrity of the landscape and the authenticity of the restoration of the house and gardens, the ICOMOS report argued that Downe and its surroundings are not of \u201coutstanding universal value\u201d as defined under the World Heritage Convention. In its letter, the British government makes the broader point that few, if any, scientific sites will be accepted onto the World Heritage List unless a dedicated set of guidelines for their treatment is drawn up. It offers \u201cto host and fund, on behalf of UNESCO, an international expert meeting to examine the issues of representing science on the World Heritage List.\u201d ICOMOS declined to comment on the letter. Despite the setback, English Heritage, the government agency that has owned the Down House estate for the past decade, said it will go ahead with a new permanent exhibition, an education suite for school groups and a resources room where visitors can search the Down House collections, look at Darwin's  Beagle  notebooks online and learn more about his experiments. Culture minister David Lammy says that the government looks forward to submitting a revised bid in 2009, the bicentenary of Darwin's birth and the 150th anniversary of  The Origin of Species . \n                     Scientists mourn devastation of Valley of Geysers \n                   \n                     Stonehenge just one of a pair \n                   \n                     news in brief \n                   \n                     Save starry nights \n                   \n                     Darwin at Downe \n                   \n                     English Heritage site on Down House \n                   \n                     UNESCO's World Heritage Centre \n                   \n                     World Conservation Union \n                   \n                     South China Karst \n                   \n                     Jeju Volcanic Island \n                   \n                     Madagascar's rainforests \n                   \n                     Carpathian forests \n                   \n                     Teide National Park \n                   \n                     Lope area of Gabon \n                   \n                     Jungfrau-Aletsch-Bietschhorn, Switzerland \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Now an analysis by the World Health Organization (WHO) reveals that about a quarter of the annual health and death toll of living in such environments could be avoided. See  graphic. The report is the result of an eight-year meta-analysis of relevant scientific literature and available health and population statistics, which went through the fraction of mortality and illness attributable to environmental causes factor by factor. More than 100 public-health experts and epidemiologists advised on the regional health impacts. Polluted water, poor sanitation and smoke inhalation resulting from indoor use of wood-burning stoves are the main risks in most low-income countries, and poverty is a major obstacle when it comes to reducing risk exposure. But environmental factors pose an avoidable health risk in rich countries as well, says Annette Pr\u00fcss, a WHO public-health scientist who oversees the project. Noise, work stress and outdoor pollution all add to the burden of ill health attributable to the environment. The WHO's research centres on 'disability adjusted life years' (DALY) that are preventable through healthier environments.

The work was announced on 18 June in a last-minute presentation at the annual meeting of the International Society for Stem Cell Research in Cairns, Australia. These findings will renew hopes that similar cells can be produced for humans. \u201cWe've been waiting for this for some time,\u201d said Alan Trounson of Monash University, Victoria, Australia, who introduced the presentation. The work was carried out by Shoukhrat Mitalipov of the Oregon National Primate Research Center in Portland and colleagues. They removed the chromosomes from unfertilized monkey eggs and replaced them with nuclei from the skin cells of an adult rhesus monkey ( Macaca mulatta ). A total of 278 oocytes yielded 21 blastocysts (hollow early embryos), from which the team eventually derived two embryonic stem-cell lines. The work has not yet been published. The failure of earlier attempts to clone embryonic stem cells in this way using monkeys had led several experienced researchers in the field to suggest that characteristics specific to primates might make it impossible (C. Simerly,  et al .  Science   300,  297; 2003). \u201cNow we know primates are possible, like other mammal species,\u201d says Norio Nakatsuji from Kyoto University, who has established primate stem-cell lines from uncloned embryos. One possibly crucial aspect of the new work is a gentler way of removing chromosomes from the egg by using imaging software rather than staining and ultraviolet light to guide the process. Jos\u00e9 Cibelli, a cloning expert at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, says there is no clear reason why techniques to make human embryonic stem cells through nuclear transfer need be very different from those used in non-human primates. But he cautions that \u201cwhat works in rhesus monkeys doesn't work in baboons.\u201d The Oregon group's work has yet to be replicated in monkeys, but Renee Reijo Pera at Stanford University, California, plans to apply the techniques to other primates.

On  page 799  of this issue 1 , 2 , and in a themed issue of  Genome Research 3 , scientists report the first findings from a project called ENCODE. This 'encyclopedia of DNA elements' attempts to discover how our cells make sense of the DNA sequence in the human genome. Already, ENCODE is up-ending one piece of conventional scientific wisdom: the idea that biologically relevant DNA resists change over evolutionary time. ENCODE aims to catalogue all the \u201cfunctional elements\u201d in the genome \u2014 the DNA sequences that control how and when our cells use our genes. Most of these controls seem to be written into so-called non-coding DNA, which does not make a detectable protein product. Because organisms depend on functional elements working correctly, scientists have long thought that such elements should not change much over evolutionary time. So researchers have mostly looked for key functional elements in non-coding DNA that is the same across species, known as conserved or constrained DNA. But ENCODE is the first project to compare long stretches of non-coding DNA across many mammals, from mice to monkeys to humans. This comparison suggests that evolutionary processes don't always freeze functional DNA in place. \u201cThe fact that we found so much functional sequence that did not seem to be evolutionarily constrained across all mammals is really surprising,\u201d says Elliott Margulies of the National Human Genome Research Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, who co-chaired one of the ENCODE analysis groups. The finding comes from the ENCODE pilot project, which used multiple methods to collect and analyse data on just 1% of the human genome \u2014 not an easy task (see  'Scaling up to a monumental task' ). In one part of the project, groups of experimental biologists used a suite of laboratory techniques to find out what portions of the genome might be functional. Meanwhile, groups of computational biologists compared the ENCODE sequences across humans and 28 other animals to find constrained regions of DNA that had changed little throughout evolution. But when the different groups compared their results, they found that their predictions about key portions of the genome didn't always agree: the biologists' list of functional sequences didn't match the computational group's list of constrained sequences. At first, many were sceptical of this result, says John Stamatoyannopoulos of the University of Washington in Seattle, a co-chair of one of the ENCODE analysis groups. \u201cIt raised some eyebrows,\u201d he says. \u201cBut eventually all the ENCODE groups started coming out with the same thing.\u201d Overall, biologists found no evidence of function for about 40% of the constrained ENCODE regions. On the flipside, about half of the functional elements found in non-coding DNA were totally unconstrained. The finding that many constrained regions weren't considered to be functional is not too surprising, because it is unlikely that ENCODE included enough tests on enough different types of cells to capture every major aspect of biology. But the idea that important DNA might also be unstable is newer, and intriguing, because it undermines the assumption that biological function requires evolutionary constraint. \u201cWe're generalizing this principle over mammals, and over many functional elements,\u201d says Ewan Birney, head of genome annotation at the European Bioinformatics Institute in Cambridge, UK, and a leader of ENCODE. \u201cWe're coming out quite strongly that this is not merely a curiosity of our genome \u2014 it's a really important part of the way our genome works.\u201d But how can major components of the mammalian genome change essentially randomly over time? That is not entirely clear. The authors of the ENCODE paper speculate that the unconstrained genomic regions are evolving \u201cneutrally\u201d \u2014 that is, they are constantly changing in ways that are neither good nor bad for the individual. This means that, on the whole, many genetic changes simply don't affect overall biology. This has major consequences for understanding the relationship between genetics and biology, Birney says. \u201cIt means, for example, that if you look at some conserved piece of biology \u2014 say, how the kidneys work in mice and humans \u2014 not all of those bits of biology will be conserved or constrained at the level of the DNA bases, and that's quite a strong shift.\u201d But not everyone agrees with that take. For example, John Mattick at the University of Queensland in Brisbane, Australia, argues that the widely accepted calculation of the baseline, or neutral, rate of mammalian evolution is flawed. Because measurements of constraint rely on a comparison with the neutral rate, it is possible that many of ENCODE's so-called unconstrained regions really aren't unconstrained, Mattick argues. \u201cI would have said that this finding suggests that many regions of our genome are evolving under weak selection pressure, or that our measurements of the neutral rate of evolution are incorrect,\u201d says Mattick, who is an author on the ENCODE paper. In fact, Mattick thinks scientists are vastly underestimating how much of the genome is functional. He and Birney have placed a bet on the question. Mattick thinks at least 20% of possible functional elements in our genome will eventually be proven useful. Birney thinks fewer are functional. The loser will buy the winner a case of the beverage of his choice. Meanwhile, other scientists are gathering data to answer new questions raised by ENCODE. Many hope that other ongoing studies, such as comparable genome sequences from additional primate species, will help decide which parts of the ENCODE data to study first. \n                     Help flies in for human genome \n                   \n                     Genetics: What is a gene? \n                   \n                     ENCODE web focus \n                   \n                     NHGRI ENCODE project \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

The kingdom is at or near the bottom of rankings for science and technology research and has one of the world's worst track records on academic freedom, not to mention women's and other human rights. Despite all this, the country's plans for the multibillion-dollar King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST) have not only secured the help of a blue-ribbon advisory panel of international academics, but have them gushing with superlatives. They say it could be an entr\u00e9e into academic freedom in the region when it opens in 2009. \u201cI'm a tremendous enthusiast,\u201d says Frank Rhodes, president emeritus of Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, and a panel member. \u201cIt's going to be of enormous significance for the whole Middle East and beyond.\u201d Frank Press, president emeritus of the US National Academy of Sciences and another member of the panel, adds: \u201cThey might achieve what no one has ever done \u2014 build a world-class university in less than a generation. This could be nation-changing.\u201d One reason for such optimism is the scale of the venture. Saudi Arabia currently invests a pittance on research \u2014 0.25% of its GDP. The king's donation is expected to be several billion dollars, making it one of the world's top ten university endowments. The country will spend another US$2 billion building a vast campus town on the Red Sea coast 90 kilometres north of Jeddah and $100 million a year for ten years creating joint labs with top research groups worldwide. The graduate university will have interdisciplinary centres instead of departments and will focus on regional interests such as water and energy. Unlike Saudi Arabia's other state-run universities, KAUST will be managed by independent trustees. Their autonomy will be guaranteed by the endowment, which will be managed abroad by a foundation claimed to be independent of Saudi control. Only a third of the 600 faculty members and 2,000 students are expected to be Saudis. \u201cKAUST is not only a signal of interest in international partnerships, but to bring international researchers to the kingdom,\u201d says panel member Calestous Juma, an expert in international development at Harvard University. He adds that this signifies an opening up of both science and society in the kingdom. KAUST has outsourced recruitment to top university departments worldwide, which will get cooperative deals worth millions of dollars annually in return. One appointment will be of particular interest: KAUST's founding president, to be selected by an international committee. What if the committee chooses a woman? \u201cThe search is merit-based; if a woman is the best candidate we will have no problem with that,\u201d says Mohammed Mulla, a university spokesman. Members of the search committee say that it may be difficult to find a woman willing to take the post, given the severe restrictions placed on women in the kingdom, but insist that if there is any interference in their choice they will resign. Reassurance on human rights was a precondition before panel members agreed to take part, says Press. \u201cThe Saudis agreed that at this university, this town, there would be no discrimination on sex, religion or ethnicity \u2014 that there would be complete freedom.\u201d Some seasoned Middle East watchers are more wary. \u201cThe bureaucratic police state will no doubt buy the best scientific equipment and personnel that money can buy,\u201d says Ziauddin Sardar, a UK-based writer on the cultures of Islam and science. \u201cBut it cannot provide the atmosphere of criticism and openness that scientific research needs to flourish.\u201d \u201cThe university sounds wonderful on paper, but I'm sceptical it will bear fruit,\u201d adds Nader Fergany, director of the Almishkat Centre for Research in Giza, Egypt. \u201cSaudi Arabia has produced expensive white-elephant universities before.\u201d The King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology, for instance, established in 1977, has not had any significant international impact. And Fergany doubts that the regime can deliver on its promise of autonomy. A first test, he says, will be whether a non-Saudi is allowed to be founding president. Fergany, who was lead author of the landmark series of Arab Human Development Reports published by the United Nations Development Programme between 2002 and 2005, also doubts that the university represents a move towards greater freedom. \u201cI would be less pessimistic if the kingdom had an overall atmosphere of opening up and reform,\u201d he says. \u201cBut the restrictions of the regime are so pervasive that an isolated campus on the Red Sea is not going to make an impact on the country.\u201d Another sticking point is relations with Israel, a research powerhouse in the region that shares many interests, such as water, with KAUST. Mulla says that Saudi Arabia cannot cooperate \u201cat the present time\u201d with countries with which it does not have diplomatic relations \u2014 which would mean no formal collaboration between KAUST and Israeli institutions. \u201cIt's a delicate issue,\u201d says Mulla, and it is being left to the side for the moment. The board has agreed to accept this situation, after receiving assurances that KAUST will be free to recruit Israeli faculty and students. \n                     US higher education: The Arizona experiment \n                   \n                     Islam and Science: Oil rich, science poor \n                   \n                     Science in the Arab world \n                   \n                     Arab state pours oil profits into science \n                   \n                     Arab science: Blooms in the desert \n                   \n                     Nature special on Islam and Science \n                   \n                     King Abdullah University of Science and Technology \n                   \n                     Amnesty International on Saudi Arabia \n                   \n                     COMSTECH Committee on Science and Technological Cooperation of Islamic States \n                   \n                     Arab Science and Technology Foundation \n                   \n                     Arab League Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization (ALECSO) \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

They say the project could harm endangered species and would erode the value of the region as a natural resource and cultural site. \u201cThe whole purpose of a national park system is to ensure that such places aren't compromised,\u201d says Marilyn Parris, the park's superintendent. The proposed Advanced Technology Solar Telescope (ATST) would tower above a cluster of smaller facilities already in use a few hundred metres from the Haleakala summit, traditionally revered by Hawaiians as the home of the mist goddess Lilinoe. With its four-metre aperture, ATST would be the largest solar telescope ever built, and it is intended to allow solar physicists to better understand the dynamics of the Sun's magnetic field. The project is spearheaded by the National Solar Observatory, and collaborators include the University of Hawaii's Institute for Astronomy and the US Air Force Research Laboratory. If the $230-million project wins approval, construction may begin as early as 2009. Installing the ATST high up, where there is less air turbulence, and in Maui's relatively dust-free, stable atmosphere, would give physicists the best chance of resolving magnetic features on the Sun's surface spanning some 30 kilometres across, explains Craig Foltz, programme manager at the US National Science Foundation. \u201cBelieve me, if we could build it smaller and lower, we would,\u201d he adds. But in a letter last month to the National Science Board, which will need to approve the project, the National Park Service's regional director Jonathan Jarvis argued that replacing Haleakala's summit with a man-made structure as the tallest feature on Maui would completely alter the visitor experience. And with the only access to the observatory site being through the national park, he is worried that construction vehicles will damage the narrow 1930s road and harm endangered nene and 'ua'u bird populations. Because the Haleakala summit carries cultural and spiritual significance for Hawaiian people, an added concern is that further development will erode the spiritual value of the mountain top for native Hawaiians. \u201cWe're not against science and the acquisition of knowledge, but science has ethics,\u201d says Ed Lindsey, a native Hawaiian and president of Maui Cultural Lands, a Maui-based organization set up to protect and restore Hawaiian cultural resources. \u201cIf you destroy things that have meaning to native people, you ultimately destroy the people.\u201d Lindsey says Maui Cultural Lands is prepared to file a lawsuit if all else fails. \n                     Climate change: A cosmic connection \n                   \n                     The dark side of the Sun \n                   \n                     Sunspot record reveals Sun's past \n                   \n                     A glimpse inside the Sun \n                   \n                     ATST \n                   \n                     Maui Cultural Lands \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

MIT has told him that 30 June is his last day. But Sherley has no intention of going quietly. Sherley, who is African-American, has argued that racial discrimination and colleagues' conflicts of interest marred his tenure process. Under-represented minorities (African-American, Hispanic and Native American) make up only 3.6% of the senior faculty at MIT; the US national average is 3.5% in natural science and engineering at \u00e9lite research universities. \u201cI am just tired of racism,\u201d says Sherley. \u201cHere I am again at a point where I am being denied something that I deserve because of my race.\u201d Frank Douglas, who is African-American, also resigned in protest as executive director of MIT's Center for Biomedical Innovation this month: \u201cI leave because I would [not] be able to advise young Blacks about their prospects of flourishing in the current environment.\u201d Sherley says signs of discrimination were evident from the moment he arrived at MIT, eight years ago. Requests to expand his lab space were denied, he says, and his lab was rarely invited to speak at departmental seminars. In March, faculty members at the biological engineering department expanded on their decision not to grant Sherley tenure, saying the process was \u201cas free as humanly possible from bias and racism\u201d. \u201cExternal letters from experts in the field of stem-cell biology were not strong enough,\u201d they wrote. They point out that two-thirds of the $1.5 million in external funds used to fund Sherley's pre-tenure research came from grants on which Sherley was not the primary investigator. On average, only a third of MIT assistant professors receive tenure. During the years before the decision, Sherley published six peer-reviewed research papers. Of the two other candidates in his department who were awarded tenure around the time when Sherley's case was being considered, one had published 12 papers during the same period, the other 18. Both bodies of work were cited on average twice as often as Sherley's. However, the value of Sherley's research cannot be appreciated merely by counting citations, says George Church, a Harvard University biologist. \u201cIt takes a little digging to see it,\u201d he says. \u201cThey don't give him any credit for the creativity.\u201d Sherley has tackled several open questions in stem-cell biology. He re-evaluated the 'immortal strand' hypothesis proposed more than 30 years ago as a mechanism by which adult stem cells prevent the accumulation of mutations in their DNA. In 2006, after his tenure application was denied, Sherley was awarded the National Institutes of Health Director's Pioneer Award for challenging research directions. Not everyone feels Sherley's work warrants tenure. \u201cI thought the decision not to grant tenure was correct,\u201d says Nancy Hopkins, an MIT biologist who led the institute's evaluation of gender equality in the late 1990s. \u201cI did not detect bias that affected this outcome. However, unintentional racial bias, like gender bias, is unavoidable in our society.\u201d Some speculate that Sherley's controversial opposition to embryonic stem-cell research was a factor. Sherley, who studies adult stem cells, has been critical of embryonic stem-cell research on ethical and practical grounds. Sherley ended his March hunger strike after 12 days, when, according to him, MIT agreed to re-evaluate his case. MIT says no such agreement was ever made and no further investigation is needed. Sherley says that MIT has failed to hold up its end of the bargain; the university says that the inquiry held before the strike by a committee of senior faculty members, who were approved by Sherley, is sufficient. His complaints have triggered one change, though: after the hunger strike, MIT announced a new initiative on race. It includes a study modelled on the 1999 investigation led by Hopkins on female scientists, and aims to quantify differences such as salary, lab space and the time between tenure and promotion to full professor. The study is due to be completed in September 2008. For Sherley, the results will come too late. \u201cHis term as a member of the faculty ends on 30 June,\u201d says MIT chancellor Phillip Clay. \u201cThe review process is complete.\u201d \n                 See Editorial, page 753. \n               \n                     MIT biologist ends hunger strike  \n                   \n                     News in brief \n                   \n                     News in brief \n                   \n                     Stem cell conference \n                   \n                     Nature Network Boston \n                   \n                     NatureJobs \n                   \n                     MIT Faculty Newsletter Sherley page \n                   \n                     Report on Diversity in Science and Engineering Faculties at Research Universities \n                   \n                     NSF Science and Engineering Statistics \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

A government committee has cleared a top cancer researcher and his group of wrongdoing after a US journal retracted their paper over charges of data manipulation. But India's ethics watchdog, the New Delhi-based Society for Scientific Values (SSV), charges the committee with \u201cpossible complicity\u201d in attempting to save the reputation of an award-winning scientist and the image of a prominent government research institute. The arguments centre on a 2005 paper in the  Journal of Biological Chemistry  ( JBC ), which examined signalling pathways in the development of skin cancer (Rangaswami, H., Bulbule, A. & Kundu, G. C.  J. Biol. Chem.   280,  19381\u201319392; 2005 ). It was authored by Gopal Kundu \u2014 2004 winner of the India's highest honour in science, the Bhatnagar prize \u2014 and two colleagues at the National Centre for Cell Science (NCCS) in Pune. The journal retracted the paper in February 2007 after an investigation prompted by an anonymous email. The authors were told that the paper contained \u201cdata that was reproduced without citation and with different labelling\u201d from a paper the same group had published in 2004 (Rangaswami, H., Bulbule, A. & Kundu, G. C.  J. Biol. Chem.   279,  38921\u201338935; 2004 ). Journal editors claimed the errors amounted to \u201cdeliberate misrepresentation\u201d. Kundu and his team deny this, saying that both papers described similar experiments run on very similar cell types. \u201cThe apparent similarity between two loading control blots \u2014 out of the 100 or so blots in the papers \u2014 did not affect the conclusions in any way,\u201d adds first author Hema Rangaswami, now a postdoc at the University of California in San Diego. \u201cWe feel  JBC 's decision to withdraw our paper was totally unfair.\u201d But Shelagh Ferguson-Miller, chair of the publications committee for the journal's publisher, says that it does not plan to reconsider the paper's withdrawal. A seven-member committee, set up by the Department of Biotechnology, which oversees the NCCS, appears to back up Rangaswami's claims. In its 30 May report, the committee said the allegations were baseless. \u201cOur detailed investigation shows there was no manipulation,\u201d says Govindarajan Padmanabhan, chairman of the committee. He adds that the journal did not analyse the researchers' raw data, but instead relied on image analysis of published figures. Padmanabhan says the committee plans to appeal to the journal to rescind the withdrawal. But the SSV claims its own findings, released on 28 April, suggested that the group fabricated images in the second paper from blots in the first paper. Sohan Modak, a former member of the centre's governing council and whose complaint launched the SSV investigation, says he remains convinced the images are the same. The jury may still be still out, but Kundu has already paid a price. His nomination to the fellowship of the Indian National Science Academy has been held up. And Rangaswami's PhD hangs in the balance: she has not yet been called to defend her thesis at Pune University. \n                     The good, the bad and the ugly \n                   \n                     Image manipulation: CSI: cell biology \n                   \n                     Society for Scientific Values \n                   \n                     National Centre for Cell Science \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

The paper in question, published in 2002, claimed to find evidence for so-called 'multipotent adult progenitor cells', or MAPCs, in mouse bone marrow (Y. Jiang  et al .  Nature   418 , 41\u201349; 2002). The work was led by Catherine Verfaillie, now director of the Stem Cell Institute at the Catholic University of Leuven, in Belgium. The correction states that figures showing proteins on the surface of the MAPCs contained many errors, including duplications. Verfaillie's group provides replacement data and says that the correction does not undermine the paper's conclusion that MAPCs can give rise to a wide range of different cell types. The paper challenged the prevailing idea that only stem cells derived from embryos were highly flexible. Some of its results have been reproduced by other labs, but no one has been able to replicate the work independently in its entirety. \u201cI believe that despite the hype over the mistake, we and  Nature  made the conclusion that the final findings of the paper still stand,\u201d says Verfaillie. This February, an investigation convened by the University of Minnesota \u2014 Verfaillie's former institution \u2014 found that her group had used incorrect procedures in the  Nature  paper, and that some of the data contained in it might be flawed. The investigation was a response to questions from a reporter from the magazine  New Scientist , who pointed out that the figure corrected today was partly reproduced with different labels in another paper in the journal Experimental Hematology (Y. Jiang  et al .  Exp. Hematol.  30, 896\u2013904; 2002). In response to the investigation,  Nature  convened a peer-review panel to analyse the data from the 2002 paper. According to  Nature , the experts concluded that although the figure data were flawed, the paper's conclusions are still valid. No allegations of fraud or misconduct have been levelled at Verfaillie or anyone from her group.

Last week, the 1.4-hectare glass enclosure and about 700 hectares of land around it in the desert foothills outside Tucson were sold for US$50 million. Its new owner, CDO Ranching & Development, is securing permits to build 1,500 houses around the edifice. The University of Arizona in Tucson is negotiating with the new owners to lease the facility for climate experiments. Texas oil billionaire Ed Bass spent about $200 million on the project. In 1991, the glass bubble became the centre of worldwide attention when eight people were sealed inside for a two-year 'experiment' in self-sustainability. But the project failed \u2014 oxygen had to be pumped in from outside, and the experiment ended early amid much squabbling both inside and outside the bubble. By 1996, Columbia University in New York City had taken over managing the facility. It planned extensive research projects on climate, soil and plant dynamics.

Now all it needs to do is figure out which ones may actually become reality \u2014 not an easy task. Last week, a high-level meeting in Hamburg ended without concrete suggestions for which projects to take forward. The list of facilities that European scientists would like funded is long and diverse, from biobank projects to particle accelerators. Some, such as the \u20ac360-million (US$480-million) research icebreaker  Aurora Borealis  and the \u20ac1-billion European X-ray Free Electron Laser (XFEL), have already won full or partial approval. But many others, including a planned \u20ac150-million Extreme Light Infrastructure laser initiative and the \u20ac1-billion European Spallation Source (ESS) for neutron research, are still but dreams. Thirty-five projects have been identified as key by the European Strategy Forum on Research Infrastructures (ESFRI). But paying for them all would cost more than \u20ac14 billion. \u201cWe all know that it won't be possible to have them all,\u201d says Beatrix Vierkorn-Rudolph, who is on the ESFRI executive board and an official at the German research ministry. Governments of the 27 member states, together with the ESFRI and national funding agencies, now must winnow out those projects to be built from those to be abandoned. This October, they will announce which projects on the list will receive initial funding for technical design studies; an updated roadmap is to be produced by autumn 2008. Projects that are chosen for funding will require one country to take the lead, as Germany has done for the XFEL and the icebreaker. But even that can be tricky, as negotiating the details of multinational EU projects is a notoriously cumbersome process. Building the XFEL, for example, required separate bilateral agreements between Germany and all the 12 other participating countries. And although Germany had said early on that it would cover 60% of the building costs and 75% of the operational costs, it took almost four years to finalize agreements with all partners. The money must come from some extra pot, as the EU's seventh Framework programme for research, which runs from 2007 to 2013, has only an embryonic budget for infrastructures \u2014 just enough to fund design studies and facilitate access to existing machines. Peter Tindemans, who chairs the ESS initiative, suggests that a fraction of the EU's overall budget surplus, some \u20ac3 billion to \u20ac4 billion each year, should be put aside for funding research facilities. That's twice the current EU spending on infrastructures, and roughly equal to US spending. \u201cThe ministers say research infrastructures are an area where Europe needs to act as a union,\u201d says Tindemans. \u201cLet's remind them of their promise to put their money where their mouth is.\u201d \n                     Geneticists prepare for deluge of mutant mice \n                   \n                     Swedish enthusiasm peps up plans for neutron source \n                   \n                     Europe urged to set up advisory body on research infrastructure \n                   \n                     European Roadmap for Research Infrastructures \n                   \n                     European Bionformatics Institute \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Further troubling reports have surfaced in the case of a disgraced US official accused of political interference in the workings of the Endangered Species Act. It has been disclosed that Julie MacDonald, former deputy assistant secretary for fish, wildlife and parks at the Department of the Interior (DOI), received a performance award of nearly $10,000 in 2005. Yet the report of an investigation into her conduct, released on 27 March this year, reveals that MacDonald violated federal regulations while in that position. She resigned on 1 May. The report, by the DOI's office of inspector general, paints a portrait of a woman determined to minimize the Endangered Species Act's effect on the economy. It includes evidence from colleagues that she heavily edited science reports from the field despite having no formal scientific training, and bullied and intimidated field scientists into producing documents along the lines she wanted.

Davies learned through a Freedom of Information Act request that MacDonald received a Special Thanks for Achieving Results award of $9,628 in March 2005, during the period covered by the investigation. The DOI will not detail the reasons for the award; it says the justification is included in her performance evaluation, which is private. Meanwhile, Democrats in Congress are investigating MacDonald for her role in removing the Sacramento splittail fish from the endangered species list.

Diplomats are cautiously optimistic that a deal may be within reach, perhaps by the end of June, to save the lives of five Bulgarian nurses and a Palestinian doctor condemned to death in Libya for allegedly deliberately injecting over 400 children with HIV in 1998. Private negotiations have recently intensified between Libya and the European Union \u2014 which Bulgaria joined on 1 January \u2014 to try to find a way out of the politically charged case. Any deal would have to balance provision of humanitarian aid for long-term treatment of the infected children, and support for their families, against compromising the medical workers' defence with implied guilt. Islamic law allows for blood money to substitute for punishment. The medics were condemned to death on 19 December 2006. Arrested in 1999, they were first found guilty and sentenced to death in May 2004, but the Libyan Supreme Court overturned the verdict and ordered a retrial. When that retrial also found them guilty, it sparked a worldwide political and public outcry. Scientists argue that medical evidence exonerates the six, and that contaminated medical supplies and equipment caused the outbreak. This evidence was denied a hearing in court. The six have lodged an ultimate appeal to the Supreme Court, but no date has been set for this. The case has seen many false starts, but diplomats are now cautiously optimistic that progress is being made. On 27 May, the medics were acquitted of a separate but related case of slander, for accusing police of torturing them to extract confessions. Other political moves have been afoot. Tony Blair, Britain's outgoing prime minister, met with Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi on a farewell trip to Africa last week. Blair's office said their discussion would include the medics' case. In public, Blair announced strengthened cooperation between the two countries \u2014 perhaps significant, as the HIV case has become an obstacle to Libya's ongoing integration into the international community. After meeting with Blair, a representative for the infected childrens' families indicated his openness to reaching a solution. At the same time, Libya's foreign ministry issued a statement that the ongoing talks were intended \u201cto find a solution favourable for all sides\u201d. Nicolas Sarkozy, the new French president, made resolution of the case a foreign-policy priority in his victory speech last month. And George W. Bush, in an interview on Bulgarian Television last week, reiterated the United States's desire for the case to \u201cbe solved quickly and in a way that is satisfactory to the Bulgarian people.\u201d Diplomats hope that the activity might result in a resolution before a summit of European Union heads of state in Vienna on 21 June, just before Germany's presidency of the European Union ends. \u201cWe are greatly appreciative of the very strong European diplomatic activity,\u201d says Emmanuel Altit, a member of the medic's defence team. \u201cThe talks are going in the right direction.

Honolulu, Hawaii Researchers credit servicing missions involving astronauts with rescuing the Hubble Space Telescope and keeping it alive for the past 17 years. But an idea to create a similar, if simpler, capability for Hubble's successor is raising eyebrows among project scientists, who fear it will be impractical and expensive. The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), currently scheduled for launch in 2013, will make infrared observations from a position in space 1.5 million kilometres from Earth. That puts it farther away than Hubble, which sits in low-Earth orbit just 600 kilometres away, within easy reach of the shuttle. So the JWST was designed assuming that it would fly without any servicing \u2014 by astronaut or robot \u2014 for its five-to-ten-year career. But Edward Weiler, head of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, which manages the JWST, has indicated that there may be scope for a manned mission to service or make simple repairs to the telescope. \u201cIt might be valuable if astronauts could fly to the JWST to do something that was a critical, but easy fix,\u201d says Weiler, \u201clike opening a stuck antenna.\u201d Weiler, who used to be NASA's science chief, floated the idea of attaching a docking port to the telescope to allow a future mission to hook up. But the concept got a chilly reception last week at the American Astronomical Society's biannual meeting in Honolulu, Hawaii. When the JWST was being developed, it seemed impossible that it would ever receive guests \u2014 it will be well beyond the reach of the shuttle. Only the decision to develop the Orion crew exploration vehicle, due to replace the shuttle after its retirement in 2010 and take astronauts back to the Moon, puts the telescope within reach. \u201cIf Orion is available, and we have a really simple, but significant problem on the JWST, wouldn't it make sense to ensure that astronauts could go to the JWST if they could fix it?\u201d asks Weiler. But the harsh radiation environment in deep space would probably make it far too dangerous for astronauts, says John Mather, the JWST's chief project scientist at Goddard. And a robot mission could probably do very little. It might be able to give the satellite a good shake to loosen a stuck solar panel, says Mather, but would be unlikely to cope with more complex tasks. And in its repair efforts, it might dirty the telescope's outer mirrors. Mather says the JWST's team is now conducting a feasibility study to find out whether a docking port could be added. But given that it is unlikely that a problem so simple it could be fixed by a robot will surface during the mission, Mather says he is not keen to add something to the already grossly over-budget telescope. \u201cIf it costs more than a few thousand dollars,\u201d he says, \u201cI'm not interested.\u201d Repair missions to spacecraft closer to Earth than the JWST have so far been rare, but not unheard of. An orbiting mission to study the Sun was rescued by a service mission carried out by astronauts on the space shuttle  Challenger  in 1984. The first servicing mission to Hubble in 1993 fixed a critical error, installing a corrective optics system to fix the telescope's blurry vision. It has since been serviced a further three times. \n                     US astronomy: Is the next big thing too big? \n                   \n                     Space telescopes: Mountain at the top \n                   \n                     NASA under pressure to extend Hubble's life \n                   \n                     Astronomers urge NASA not to cut corners on Hubble successor \n                   \n                     Human space flight in focus \n                   \n                     James Webb Space Telescope \n                   \n                     Space.com's report \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Tempers erupted last week at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Z\u00fcrich (ETHZ), with faculty members claiming that its board had sneakily siphoned its budget off to Switzerland's other federal institute, the EPFL in Lausanne. Interim president of ETHZ Konrad Osterwalder has complained formally to the Swiss government, saying that the ETH Board \u2014 a politically independent body responsible for both universities and for four federal research institutes \u2014 \u201cmade serious errors in both the form and content of [its] decision on the allocation of the 2008 budget\u201d. Department heads at ETHZ have also asked Pascal Couchepin, the government minister responsible for research and higher education, for his support in solving the crisis. As part of Switzerland's push to bolster its research and higher education sector, the ETH Board's budget for 2008 will be nearly 4% higher than that for this year. The board decided to give a disproportionate sum to EPFL, even though there has been no political decision about how Switzerland might afford a second top-level university, say staff from ETHZ. The staff say that the board used different starting budgets to calculate the percentage increase for each institute, and that it did not release the information within the required time before the meeting. ETHZ also hit the headlines last November when faculty members forced its president, Ernst Hafen, to resign.

President George W. Bush's 31 May announcement of a \u201cnew framework\u201d for international efforts to confront climate change sounded, at first, like a sharp turnaround by the White House. But as analysts dissected his statements, many concluded that he had said little new. In a speech in Washington DC to the Global Leadership Campaign, a group that lobbies for greater spending on international affairs, Bush called for the top-emitting countries to meet by the end of 2008 to set a long-term global goal for greenhouse-gas emissions. The notion of Bush proposing a global target to tackle climate change caused a flurry of excitement. But in a briefing afterwards, James Connaughton, the president's environmental adviser, said that Bush was referring only to \u201ca long-term aspirational goal\u201d rather than a binding commitment. \u201cIt is the implementing mechanisms that become binding,\u201d he said. \u201cIt remains to be seen whether this initiative means anything,\u201d says Bert Metz, a climatologist at the Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency in Bilthoven. Stabilizing atmospheric levels of greenhouse gases, he says, requires \u201cambitious and urgent international collaboration. Only starting the discussions on this next year sounds rather strange.\u201d Arriving before the annual G8 meeting of the richest nations' leaders in Germany this week, many have interpreted Bush's proposal as a tactical manoeuvre to lighten the pressure on him to agree to do anything firm about climate change at that meeting. Alden Meyer, a climate specialist at the Union of Concerned Scientists in Cambridge, Massachusetts, adds that it \u201ccould serve as a huge diversion\u201d at the planned United Nations (UN) negotiations about climate change in Bali in December. Others argue that Bush's proposed framework may help rather than hinder progress. \u201cI think that there is a good chance that whatever comes out of this process will merge into the UN process,\u201d says Jeff Holmstead, a former environment official with the Bush administration, now at the law firm Bracewell and Giuliani in Washington DC. Stephen Schneider, a climatologist at Stanford University in California, thinks that a side deal, separate from but not replacing the UN process, could in theory be helpful. But he says that the last such side deal initiated by Bush \u2014 the Asia\u2013Pacific partnership of July 2005, which heavily emphasized technology developments to address climate change \u2014 is widely regarded as a flop. \u201cIt lets greenhouse gases continue to rise at the same rate and under-funds research by a factor of 100. People who are cynical and view [the new proposal] as disingenuous have a long historical trail to base this on,\u201d he adds. Japan and Australia, participants in the Asia-Pacific deal, have welcomed Bush's plan. Shinzo Abe, Japan's prime minister, has said he thinks the United States is \u201cfinally getting serious in dealing with global warming\u201d. Last week, Abe launched Japan's plan for a non-binding arrangement to halve global greenhouse-gas emissions by 2050. China, another Asia-Pacific partner and the world's second largest emitter of carbon dioxide after the United States, also announced its plan to tackle climate change this week. It intends to focus on improving environmental management and agricultural and energy efficiencies and, like the United States, boost research and development for alternative energy, but without compromising economic development. China notes that its per-capita emissions are lower than the world average, and much lower than those of the United States. The United States, it says, should take the lead in reducing emissions. \n                 Additional reporting by Quirin Schiermeier and David Cyranoski \n               \n                     Climate panel offers grounds for optimism \n                   \n                     A clear direction \n                   \n                     Tackling greenhouse gases looks to be affordable \n                   \n                     Climate talks seek to rein in greenhouse gases \n                   \n                     Climate takes aim \n                   \n                     Climate Change in Focus \n                   \n                     Bush's 31 May speech \n                   \n                     Whitehouse fact-sheet on the plan \n                   \n                     Asia-Pacific Partnership \n                   \n                     China's plan \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Research reported this week by three different groups shows that normal skin cells can be reprogrammed to an embryonic state in mice 1 , 2 , 3 . The race is now on to apply the surprisingly straightforward procedure to human cells. If researchers succeed, it will make it relatively easy to produce cells that seem indistinguishable from embryonic stem cells, and that are genetically matched to individual patients. There are limits to how useful and safe these would be for therapeutic use in the near term, but they should quickly prove a boon in the lab. \u201cIt would change the way we see things quite dramatically,\u201d says Alan Trounson of Monash University in Victoria, Australia. Trounson wasn't involved in the new work but says he plans to start using the technique \u201ctomorrow\u201d. \u201cI can think of a dozen experiments right now \u2014 and they're all good ones,\u201d he says. In theory, embryonic stem cells can propagate themselves indefinitely and are able to become any type of cell in the body. But so far, the only way to obtain embryonic stem cells involves destroying an embryo, and to get a genetic match for a patient would mean, in effect, cloning that person \u2014 all of which raise difficult ethical questions. As well as having potential ethical difficulties, the 'cloning' procedure is technically difficult. It involves obtaining unfertilized eggs, replacing their genetic material with that from an adult cell and then forcing the cell to divide to create an early-stage embryo, from which the stem cells can be harvested. Those barriers may have now been broken down. \u201cNeither eggs nor embryos are necessary. I've never worked with either,\u201d says Shinya Yamanaka of Kyoto University, who has pioneered the new technique. Last year, Yamanaka introduced a system that uses mouse fibroblasts, a common cell type that can easily be harvested from skin, instead of eggs 4 . Four genes, which code for four specific proteins known as transcription factors, are transferred into the cells using retroviruses. The proteins trigger the expression of other genes that lead the cells to become pluripotent, meaning that they could potentially become any of the body's cells. Yamanaka calls them induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS cells). \u201cIt's easy. There's no trick, no magic,\u201d says Yamanaka. The results were met with amazement, along with a good dose of scepticism. Four factors seemed too simple. And although the cells had some characteristics of embryonic cells \u2014 they formed colonies, could propagate continuously and could form cancerous growths called teratomas \u2014 they lacked others. Introduction of iPS cells into a developing embryo, for example, did not produce a 'chimaera' \u2014 a mouse carrying a mix of DNA from both the original embryo and the iPS cells throughout its body. \u201cI was not comfortable with the term 'pluripotent' last year,\u201d says Hans Sch\u00f6ler, a stem-cell specialist at the Max Planck Institute for Molecular Biomedicine in M\u00fcnster who is not involved with any of the three articles. This week, Yamanaka presents a second generation of iPS cells 1 , which pass all these tests. In addition, a group led by Rudolf Jaenisch 2  at the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and a collaborative effort 3  between Konrad Hochedlinger of the Harvard Stem Cell Institute and Kathrin Plath of the University of California, Los Angeles, used the same four factors and got strikingly similar results. \u201cIt's a relief as some people questioned our results, especially after the Hwang scandal,\u201d says Yamanaka, referring to the irreproducible cloning work of Woo Suk Hwang, which turned out to be fraudulent. Sch\u00f6ler agrees: \u201cNow we can be confident that this is something worth building on.\u201d The improvement over last year's results was simple. The four transcription factors used by Yamanaka reprogramme cells inconsistently and inefficiently, so that less than 0.1% of the million cells in a simple skin biopsy will be fully reprogrammed. The difficulty is isolating those in which reprogramming has been successful. Researchers do this by inserting a gene for antibiotic resistance that is activated only when proteins characteristic of stem cells are expressed. The cells can then be doused with antibiotics, killing off the failures. The protein Yamanaka used as a marker for stem cells last year was not terribly good at identifying reprogrammed cells. This time, all three groups used two other protein markers \u2014 Nanog and Oct4 \u2014 to great effect. All three groups were able to produce chimaeric mice using iPS cells isolated in this way; and the mice passed iPS DNA on to their offspring. Jaenisch also used a special embryo to produce fetuses whose cells were derived entirely from iPS cells. \u201cOnly the best embryonic stem cells can do this,\u201d he says. \u201cIt's unbelievable, just amazing,\u201d says Sch\u00f6ler, who heard Jaenisch present his results at a meeting on 31 May in Bavaria. \u201cFor me it's like Dolly [the first cloned mammal]. It's that type of accomplishment.\u201d The method is inviting. Whereas cloning with humans was limited by the number of available eggs and by a tricky technique that takes some six months to master, Yamanaka's method can use the most basic cells and can be accomplished with simple lab techniques. But applying the method to human cells has yet to be successful. \u201cWe are working very hard \u2014 day and night,\u201d says Yamanaka. It will probably require more transcription factors, he adds. If it works, researchers could produce iPS cells from patients with conditions such as Parkinson's disease or diabetes and observe the molecular changes in the cells as they develop. This 'disease in a dish' would offer the chance to see how different environmental factors contribute to the condition, and to test the ability of drugs to check disease progression. But the iPS cells aren't perfect, and could not be used safely to make genetically matched cells for transplant in, for example, spinal-cord injuries. Yamanaka found that one of the factors seems to contribute to cancer in 20% of his chimaeric mice. He thinks this can be fixed, but the retroviruses used may themselves also cause mutations and cancer. \u201cThis is really dangerous. We would never transplant these into a patient,\u201d says Jaenisch. In his view, research into embryonic stem cells made by cloning remains \u201cabsolutely essential\u201d. If the past year is anything to judge by, change will come quickly. \u201cI'm not sure if it will be us, or Jaenisch, or someone else, but I expect some big success with humans in the next year,\u201d says Yamanaka.

Ten radical environmental activists have been sentenced over the past few weeks for a string of arsons committed in the late 1990s and early 2000s. The group, extremists claiming to be members of the Earth Liberation Front and Animal Liberation Front, targeted scientists and sites involved in activities such as logging and the culling of wild horses. As  Nature  went to press, most of the sentences had been handed out, and they ranged from 3 to 13 years. Lauren Regan, a lawyer working with the convicted arsonists, says the sentences are \u201cnot surprising and within the realm of reasonable\u201d, but that 'terrorism enhancements' added to many sentences will make their treatment in jail much more harsh and will label them for the rest of their lives. The judge in the case, Ann Aiken, ruled that crimes carried out with \u201cintent or desire to influence, affect, or retaliate against government conduct\u201d were eligible for these enhancements. She made it clear, though, that she was ruling only on the narrow legal question of whether the crimes fit the legal criteria for the enhancement, and not on the broader, more controversial question of whether the people involved should be labelled as terrorists. One of the biggest fires, and perhaps the most memorable to the scientific community, was the torching of a building in the Center for Urban Horticulture at the University of Washington in Seattle on 21 May 2001. The fire targeted the work of Toby Bradshaw, whom the group thought was genetically engineering poplar trees. \u201cI am delighted that the perpetrators have been caught,\u201d says Bradshaw, \u201cand satisfied that the criminal-justice system is capable of determining an appropriate punishment.\u201d Group members were also found responsible for torching a lab of the US Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) in Olympia, Washington, on 21 June 1998. Lab worker Dale Nolte, who now works on avian flu for the service, says that he hasn't followed the trial and has no opinion on the sentencings. \u201cMy focus from the beginning was to recover our facilities, to keep up the morale of our scientists and keep the work going,\u201d he says. One of this group was sentenced to more than 12 years in prison, which included a terrorism enhancement. The sentencing memo depicts a group of ideological activists who were not always successful at crime. Their cars broke down, accomplices dropped out at the last minute, members of the group were busted for shoplifting and time and again their incendiary devices failed to go off. Yet, according to federal prosecutors, they racked up more than US$40 million in damages between 1995 and 2001. No one was harmed during the group's actions, although many contend that this was more through luck than careful planning. \n                     Environmental activism: In the name of nature \n                   \n                     To build bridges, or to burn them \n                   \n                     News in brief \n                   \n                     News in brief \n                   \n                     News in brief \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

The discovery of chicken bones with Polynesian DNA at an archaeological site in Chile has added hard, physical evidence to the controversial theory that ancient seafarers from the south Pacific visited the New World long before Columbus. When the Spanish conquistador Francisco Pizarro first visited Peru in 1532, he noted the importance of chickens in the daily lives and religious rituals of the Incas. But how the birds got there was a mystery. Chickens were first domesticated in Asia, and their absence from archaeological sites in the Americas indicates that they were not carried by migrating peoples over a land bridge from Asia to Alaska. One alternative theory \u2014 that Polynesians visited the Americas, bringing livestock with them and perhaps influencing cultural and technological development in the region \u2014 has long been disparaged by mainstream archaeologists, as it has largely been supported by supposition rather than evidence. So Alice Storey of the University of Auckland, New Zealand, was not particularly enthusiastic when a colleague in Chile asked her to sequence DNA from a trove of ancient chicken bones he had excavated at El Arenal, a site occupied between 700 and 1390  AD , to see if their origins could be traced to the Pacific islands. \u201cI thought, 'Well, we'll give it a go',\u201d she says. Storey and her team reconstructed a 400-base-pair fragment of mitochondrial DNA from both the Chilean bones and chicken bones excavated on five archipelagos in Polynesia. Mitochondrial DNA doesn't mutate much and so is useful for tracing evolutionary lines. The Chilean sequences were identical to those from prehistoric sites in Tonga and Samoa (A. A. Storey  et al .  Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA  doi:10.1073/pnas.0703993104; 2007). Radiocarbon analysis dated the bones to between 1304 and 1424  AD , firmly before Europeans arrived on the east coast of South America in the 1500s. The same sequences are also present in the modern-day Araucana chicken, an odd Chilean breed that has tufted 'ears', lays blue eggs and lacks a tail. The study has left the research community cautiously optimistic that hard evidence for migration of Polynesians has been found. Jaime Gongora, a molecular geneticist at the University of Sydney, Australia, says the paper is a significant contribution to the field, but warns that the small fragments obtained from ancient DNA may tell only part of the story. The final verdict will require more extensive DNA data to make a full family tree of both modern and ancient breeds, he says. Archaeologist Terry Jones at California Polytechnic State University in San Luis Obispo, who has studied prehistoric Polynesian contact in the New World, is less circumspect. \u201cIt's essentially unequivocal evidence,\u201d he says. Evidence of contact between the communities has been put forward in the past. In 1947, Thor Heyerdahl famously filmed his journey by raft from Peru across the Pacific to try to prove that South Americans could have settled the Pacific islands; although the theory was at odds with much of the evidence. More recently, Jones, along with Kathryn Klar at the University of California, Berkeley, has argued that the Polynesians introduced complex fish hooks and sewn plank canoes to the Chumash and Gabrielino Indians in southern California and the Mapuche Indians in Chile (K. A. Klar and T. L. Jones  Am. Antiquity   70,  457\u2013484; 2005). Others argue that Polynesians must have visited the tropical coast of South America in order to bring back the sweet potato and the bottle gourd. The voyage to South America is no more daunting than other trips Polynesians are known to have made. Even so, one of the co-authors on the chicken study, Atholl Anderson at the Australian National University, Canberra, is wary of overestimating the extent of this cultural diffusion without further study.

It isn't every clinical scientist who in the space of a month sends a major drug company's stock plummeting, is invited to testify at Congress and is crowned one of the world's 100 most influential people by  Time  magazine. But then, they aren't Steven Nissen, the cardiologist who last week fingered the diabetes drug Avandia as carrying a possible risk of heart attacks (see  Weighing up the evidence ). This is not the first or most famous case for Nissen, 58, who is based at the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio. In 2001, while serving on a committee of external advisers to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), he raised concerns about the safety of a painkiller called Vioxx. Before then, he had made his name pioneering an ultrasound technique that allowed doctors to see fatty plaques of atherosclerosis (see  Nature Med.   11,  700; 2005). Since Vioxx, Nissen says that he has become more concerned about the scientific rigour of drug regulation, prompting him to dig into clinical-trial data that suggest hidden drug risks. \u201cI don't go looking for these things, but they sure seem to find me,\u201d he says. Between running trials for several drug companies, he has flagged cardiovascular risks in drugs for everything from attention deficit hyperactivity disorder to heart failure itself, often costing companies millions in the process. His fans praise him for refusing to pull his punches. \u201cHe will persevere for what he believes is right, regardless of the toes on which he may tread,\u201d says Peter Libby, chief of cardiology at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, Massachusetts, who has worked with Nissen for twelve years. But his methods have earned him enemies, too, many of whom contend that he is more interested in felling the next Goliath than in seeking scientific truth. \u201cThe caped crusader Nissen is at it again,\u201d groused a critic on the  Wall Street Journal's  health blog on 21 May. Bob Temple, director of medical policy at the FDA's drug review centre, has also taken a shot at Nissen. Temple told  RPM Report  that he was \u201csort of stunned\u201d by Nissen's suggestions to Congress that senior FDA officials had overruled their underlings' safety concerns. \u201cI can tell you, he didn't see that,\u201d Temple said. Nissen certainly isn't always right. Speaking to journalists last October, he put Pfizer's cholesterol drug torcetrapib, for which he was overseeing a clinical trial, at the top of a list of hot stories that reporters should watch in 2007. Weeks later, Pfizer pulled the plug on the drug when it was found to raise death rates in late-stage trials (see  Nature   444 , 794\u2013795; doi:10.1038/444794a 2006 ). \u201cAfter the torcetrapib business, I thought I would lay low for a while,\u201d Nissen said last week. \u201cThen I stumble across this [Avandia] problem and here we are again.\u201d \n                     Review uncovers new killer drug \n                   \n                     Vioxx may trigger heart attacks within days \n                   \n                     Journal grows suspicious of Vioxx data \n                   \n                     FDA considers antidepressant risks for kids \n                   \n                     Analysis highlights suicide risk of antidepressants \n                   \n                     Nature Medicine  blog \n                   \n                     Nature Reviews Drug Discovery \n                   \n                     Steven Nissen \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Science has made an unexpectedly strong showing in the government of Fran\u00e7ois Fillon, prime minister of France's newly elected president, Nicolas Sarkozy. The environment and energy, in both the French media and government, have become  \u00e0 la mode . Ecology and sustainable development, long relegated to puny ministries, have been propelled to a top-rank superministry. And at its helm is a political heavyweight \u2014 Alain Jupp\u00e9, a former prime minister and foreign minister. The ministry will have responsibility for the huge sectors of transport, urban and rural planning, energy policy, and other ecological areas such as biodiversity, water and pollution. Science and higher education have been granted a full-blown ministry, too, headed by Val\u00e9rie P\u00e9cresse. The move was by no means guaranteed, given that Sarkozy has halved the number of ministers in his government to 15, and that the previous government allotted these sectors only junior status. Bernard Kouchner, co-founder of the medical humanitarian aid group M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res and a member of the opposition socialist party, has been appointed foreign minister. And Fillon, a moderate conservative, is himself no stranger to these areas: he served as research and higher-education minister in 1993\u201395 and 2004\u201305. Much of the credit for getting the environment so high on the political agenda must go to Nicolas Hulot, a highly popular TV environmentalist, journalist and writer. During the presidential election campaign, the Nicolas Hulot Foundation asked candidates to sign up to a ten-point ecological pact pledging a radical revision of policies, including energy, transport and agriculture, and to address climate change, species extinction, pollution and other environmental issues. In the face of Hulot's massive popular support (polls showed that had he run, he could have won as much as 10% of the vote), candidates, including Sarkozy, queued up to sign. It is too soon to say how the creation of France's superministry will translate into actions. But the scale of the government's environmental commitments on paper is \u201chistoric\u201d, says Yvon Le Maho, a biodiversity researcher at the Hubert Curien Multidisciplinary Institute in Strasbourg. Le Maho, along with several green non-governmental organizations, attended a planning meeting with Sarkozy and Jupp\u00e9 on 21 May to help hammer out a comprehensive five-year plan for the environment. \u201cTo be at such a meeting just days after Sarkozy took office was completely surreal,\u201d he says. The government's surprising ecological bent could also make for an interesting G8 meeting, which is scheduled for 6\u20138 June in the more traditionally green Germany. \n                     French election: Let science speak for itself \n                   \n                     French election: Is French science in decline... \n                   \n                     French science after Chirac \n                   \n                     French government concedes defeat to researchers \n                   \n                     Resignation threats add steel to French revolt \n                   \n                     Ministry of ecology and sustainable development \n                   \n                     Ministry of higher education and research \n                   \n                     Nicolas Hulot Foundation \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

A call by a group of US colleges earlier this month to boycott the most influential university ranking in the United States has shone the spotlight on the problem of institutional rankings. Experts argue that these are based on dubious methodology and spurious data, yet they have huge influence. But help is at hand: European academics are putting some rigour into rankings by tackling the problem themselves. On 5 May, Douglas Bennett, president of Earlham College in Richmond, Indiana, and 11 other college presidents asked colleagues to refuse to fill out surveys for the  U.S. News & World Report . That survey of institutions, they argued, \u201cimplies a false precision and authority that is not warranted by the data they use\u201d. Another 17 colleges have since signed up. \u201cAll current university rankings are flawed to some extent; most, fundamentally,\u201d says Alan Gilbert, president and vice-chancellor of the University of Manchester in Britain. \u201cBut rankings are here to stay, and it is therefore worth the time and effort to get them right.\u201d The rankings in the  U.S. News & World Report  and those published by the British  Times Higher Education Supplement  ( THES ) depend heavily on surveys of thousands of experts \u2014 a system that some contest. A third popular ranking, by Jiao Tong University in Shanghai, China, is based on more quantitative measures, such as citations, numbers of Nobel prizewinners and publications in  Nature  and  Science . But even these measures are not straightforward. Thomson Scientific's ISI citation data are notoriously poor for use in rankings; names of institutions are spelled differently from one article to the next, and university affiliations are sometimes omitted altogether. After cleaning up ISI data on all UK papers for such effects, the Leeds-based consultancy Evidence Ltd, found the true number of papers from the University of Oxford, for example, to be 40% higher than listed by ISI, says director Jonathan Adams. Researchers at Leiden University in the Netherlands have similarly recompiled the ISI database for 400 universities: half a million papers per year. Their system produces various rankings based on different indicators. One, for example, weights citations on the basis of their scientific field, so that a university that does well in a heavily cited field doesn't get an artificial extra boost (see  table ). The German Center for Higher Education Development (CHE) also offers rankings  \u00e0 la carte  for almost 300 German, Austrian and Swiss universities \u2014 users can query its online database by individual discipline, number of publications or student outcomes, for example. With European Union support, the CHE is expanding the system to cover all Europe. Adams says that more complex systems such as these are better than oversimplified summary tables, which policy-makers tend to take at face value. The US Commission on the Future of Higher Education is considering creating a similar public database, which would offer competition to the  U.S. News & World Report . Bennett says he will work with such groups that use \u201cprofessional standards of measurement\u201d. \n                     Plan to rank universities fails to impress \n                   \n                     Prestige is factored into journal ratings \n                   \n                     Citation analysis: The counting house \n                   \n                     A cautionary guide to university rankings \n                   \n                     Nature Peer Review Trial Debate \n                   \n                     Bennet's letter of protest \n                   \n                     The Leiden Ranking \n                   \n                     German Center for Higher Education Development (CHE) \n                   \n                     Academic Rankingof World Universities/Jiao Tong University in Shanghai \n                   \n                     THES\tWorld University Rankings \n                   \n                     US News & World Report rankings \n                   \n                     Webometrics \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Meteorologists are planning a coordinated global drive to recalibrate space-based measurements of the weather. The weather scientists are confident that better calibration will result in better data \u2014 and a fuller picture of global climate change. Meeting last week in Geneva, the World Meteorological Organization announced plans for a Global Space-based Inter-Calibration System (GSICS). The initiative will ask national satellite agencies to take steps to ensure better comparability of satellite measurements made by different instruments and satellites, and to tie these measurements to absolute references. \u201cAs the requirement for monitoring global climate becomes clearer, there is need for more accurate measurements,\u201d says Don Hinsman, director of the World Meteorological Organization's space programme. \u201cTo permit early detection of climate change, it is vital that satellite instrument calibration is of the highest quality, and that a capability exists to cross-calibrate satellite sensors.\u201d Remote sensing by some 30 satellites forms the backbone of global weather and climate monitoring today. Such measurements are vital because reliable ground-based observations are available for only about a quarter of Earth's surface. Continuous measurement of oceans, deserts and other remote and sparsely populated areas can come only from space. But such measurements are prone to error, with problems arising from instrument degradation over time, small deviations of the satellites from their planned orbits, and faults in the algorithms used to process raw numerical data into meaningful geophysical information. Flawed satellite data have caused disagreements between scientists in the past over such matters as temperature trends in the troposphere 1 . One radiometer onboard a US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration satellite \u2014 the only instrument to measure temperature in the stratosphere before 1998 \u2014 is thought to have transmitted grossly biased temperature measurements since 1979 (ref.  2 ). Even small temperature discrepancies, if undiscovered, can seriously disrupt the study of climate trends. \u201cInter-calibration has to be almost perfect if we want to look at climate trends \u2014 otherwise the bias will be stronger than the signal you want to address,\u201d says Jean-No\u00ebl Th\u00e9paut, who heads the satellite section at the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts in Reading, UK. The onboard calibration of instruments is costly and technically challenging, and provision for it has been incorporated only into new satellites. But just as important is the occasional lack of consistency between data collected from different satellite missions. \u201cThe development of new sensor technology is progressing much faster than our capability to validate data,\u201d explains Gerhard Adrian, head of research at the German Weather Service in Wiesbaden. The GSICS will make use of the exceptionally well-calibrated sensors onboard the latest generation of European and US meteorological satellites \u2014 such as Europe's MetOp-A satellite, which became operational last week \u2014 to validate data from older instruments. \u201cCross-calibration is very much in our own interest,\u201d says Johannes Schmetz, head of the meteorology division at EUMETSAT, the European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites in Darmstadt, Germany, and a member of a panel that will run the GSICS. \u201cIdeally, what we would like to have is an operational system that could precisely define, and correct for, any orbital and instrumental biases in real time.\u201d Reprocessing recently archived data using improved algorithms is also part of the plan. At EUMETSAT, robots can now do this quite quickly. Cumbersome manual 'data archaeology' is required only for old data sets stored on unwieldy magnetic tape. Satellite data are becoming ever more abundant. At the European weather centre in Reading, for example, more than 5 million data points are processed every day, with the volume of data likely to triple in the next few years. \n                     Radar satellites: Mountains to molehills \n                   \n                     Global warming anomaly may succumb to microwave study \n                   \n                     Cities and fields make the world seem warmer \n                   \n                     In focus climate change \n                   \n                     WMO \n                   \n                     EUMETSAT \n                   \n                     NOAA Earth Observation \n                   \n                     Global Earth Observation System of Systems \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

A class of RNA molecule, called a microRNA, has been found in a unicellular green alga. The discovery, made independently by two labs, dismantles the popular theory that the regulatory role of microRNAs in gene expression is tied to the evolution of multicellularity. The researchers confirmed the existence of dozens of microRNAs in the genome of the green alga  Chlamydomonas reinhardtii , and think that hundreds are likely. The finding is as startling as the discovery ten years ago that the nematode  Caenorhabditis elegans  has 19,000 genes, just 1,000 short of the human count, says Gregory Hannon from Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in New York and a co-author of one of the studies (T. Zhao  et al .  Genes Dev.   21,  1190\u20131203; 2007). \u201cPeople were shocked that the complexity of the genomes in these simpler creatures was similar to our own,\u201d he says. Now it seems that the RNA in simple unicellular organisms could be as complex as that in higher creatures. The second study, which independently came to the same conclusion, appears online in Nature this week (A. Moln\u00e1r  et al .  doi:10.1038/nature05903;  2007). Ever since the discovery of RNA interference \u2014 the selective blocking of gene expression by small RNAs \u2014 biologists have identified a growing family of these tiny molecules in eukaryotic organisms. But hunts in yeast and in the protist  Tetrahymena  have yielded fewer types of RNA molecule than found in plants and animals. MicroRNAs were never found. This, combined with the fact that RNA sequences differ between plants and animals, helped give rise to the idea that microRNAs evolved independently in plant and animal lineages as parts of complex regulatory mechanisms associated with multicellularity. Now it seems that these molecules may predate that evolutionary development. \u201cIt shows how basing conclusions on studies of just one or two model organisms can really lead you astray in terms of how you think about evolutionary processes,\u201d says Jim Umen from the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California. A combination of factors led to the recent findings: high-throughput sequencing can now sieve through thousands of RNA molecules in search of microRNA. And having a nearly completed map of the genome for the alga means that its sequences can be interpreted relatively easily. Nobody knows why such a simple organism needs microRNAs, nor how or when they first appeared. But researchers say they may help  C. reinhardtii  adapt to extremely diverse environments. Whatever their role, their presence indicates that microRNAs could be much more ancient than previously thought; they might have persisted for more than a billion years. \n                     RNAi scoops medical Nobel \n                   \n                     MicroRNAs hit the big time \n                   \n                     MicroRNAs hit the big time \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Geoff Brumfiel reports on a retired Navy admiral trying to turn around the troubled research wing. Thankfully, Jay Cohen's job did not begin with a bang. He assumed his post as undersecretary for science and technology at the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS), on 10 August 2006 \u2014 the day that British authorities reported a plot to smuggle liquid explosives aboard US-bound aircraft. In the aftermath, the DHS rushed to restore international air travel and restrict liquids on flights. Any newcomer could have easily become lost in the shuffle, but Cohen is no shrinking violet. Within a day, he had organized a rapid-response team, tasked his scientists with understanding liquid explosives and briefed staffers and others on Capitol Hill. \u201cBy 11 August,\u201d he jokes, \u201cmy shyness had waned.\u201d Shyness has little place at the science and technology (S&T) directorate, which has struggled for identity and purpose since its inception in 2003. In theory, it is the part of the department that comes up with new gizmos that allow border agents and customs officials to catch explosives or biological agents smuggled into the country. In practice, critics say, it has worked poorly with other divisions of the DHS and failed to account for its dollars. This year, a frustrated Congress slashed its budget by more than 25%, to $848 million (see bar chart). The challenge for Cohen \u2014 a retired admiral who spent six years at the helm of the Office of Naval Research \u2014 is to restore a sense of purpose and productivity. Supporters say he is a welcome force for change. \u201cI'm optimistic,\u201d says Congressman David Wu (Democrat, Oregon), who chairs the subcommittee overseeing DHS for the House Committee on Science and Technology. \u201cAdmiral Cohen's a breath of fresh air.\u201d But others wonder whether Cohen will be able to turn around the directorate during his two-year appointment. \u201cThere is still no settled view on mission priorities,\u201d says Elizabeth Grossman, a former staffer on the committee now with the Washington DC-based lobbying firm Lewis-Burke Associates. The DHS was officially born in January 2003, created by President George W. Bush as a response to the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001 (see  'Counting the chemicals' ). For the most part, Congress formed the $43-billion department \u2014 the third-largest in the federal government \u2014 by cobbling together existing agencies, such as the Coast Guard and the Secret Service. An exception was the S&T directorate, which was created from scratch. In 18 pages of legislation, Congress laid out a plan for an S&T division to research future terrorist threats and support other directorates within the DHS. The scheme included plans for establishing university research centres and for collaborating with other agencies, notably the national labs run by the Department of Energy. \u201cI think the directorate got off to a very good start,\u201d says Parney Albright, a former assistant secretary for science at the department from 2003 to 2005. But as the directorate took over research efforts from some other large agencies \u2014 such as the customs service and the Transportation Security Administration, which oversees security at airports \u2014 it became ostracised from other divisions. It was slow in evaluating scientists' proposals and releasing funding (see  Nature   424 , 986; doi:10.1038/424986a 2003 ). And its honeymoon with Congress quickly soured, in part because it failed to produce documents that justified its spending. Not everyone agrees on what led to these breakdowns. Albright attributes them to what he calls the lack of leadership from Cohen's predecessor, Charles McQueary ( Nature   423 , 106; doi:10.1038/423106a 2003 ). Other congressional staff and former departmental advisers point to the S&T division's newcomer status and high staff turnover. The loss in faith was soon matched by an erosion of the directorate's power. In the spring of 2005, it lost control of research into the prevention of nuclear attacks, an area that was split off into a separate, roughly $300-million Domestic Nuclear Detection Office. \u201cThat took a big part of the portfolio away,\u201d says William Happer, a physicist at Princeton University, New Jersey, who served on a now-defunct scientific advisory committee to the department. \n               Rupture repair \n             Meanwhile, Congress and the Bush administration were saddling the directorate with other very specific projects, such as to investigate antimissile systems for commercial aircraft. In addition to diminishing the directorate's independence, the mandatory programmes gave it a piecemeal appearance. \u201cIt was potentially more ad hoc than one would wish,\u201d says Wu. In March 2006, McQueary left to become chief of testing new weapons at the Pentagon. Later that spring, members of Congress released a damning appraisal of the S&T directorate, saying they were \u201cextremely disappointed\u201d by the agency's justifications of its programmes and \u201cdismayed\u201d by its bookkeeping. Enter Cohen. \u201cI came into the job with my eyes wide open,\u201d he says. His first priority was to realign basic research with the needs of homeland security's seven major agencies. He organized panels that included representatives from the 'gang of seven' and asked them to look at specific technical problems. He also reorganized the directorate, replacing the mission-oriented offices \u2014 such as for antimissile technology \u2014 with six subject-oriented divisions, such as infrastructure protection. Finally, he realigned the Department of Energy labs and directorate-funded university centres so that their research had a clear relationship to agency needs. \u201cThere must be an output,\u201d Cohen says. \u201cOtherwise we're a self-licking ice-cream cone.\u201d At a meeting last week designed to bring together universities, labs and department members \u2014 the first of its kind \u2014 representatives from the seven divisions generally praised his approach. Marko Bourne, director of policy at the Federal Emergency Management Agency, says that Cohen's office has helped unify research. Bourne's team is to develop new geospatial information tools that can help them to better plan disaster response. \u201cOur interactions have been much more robust,\u201d Bourne says. \u201cThis works a lot better for us.\u201d Cohen's other mission has been to repair relations with Capitol Hill. Prior to his stint as head of Naval Research, the talkative admiral served as a congressional liaison for the Navy and is well-known for his ability to work with Congress. \u201cThe one thing I'll say about Cohen \u2014 the guy's accessible,\u201d says one senior congressional staffer. \u201cWhen you're in a meeting with him, you're in a meeting with him.\u201d With his realignment complete and relations with Congress on the mend, Cohen says he now hopes to begin producing real results for the rest of the DHS. He wants to invest heavily in research on the psychology and sociology of terrorism. He also says that he would like to develop further technologies to detect improvised explosive devices and advance the use of composite materials in Coast Guard ships \u2014 two programmes he promoted heavily at the Office of Naval Research. Cohen also plans on increasing basic research at the DHS. Through reprogramming, he has already doubled basic research from 5 to 10% of the agency's budget, and he has bigger plans for the future. \u201cThe goals are 20% in basic research sustained,\u201d he says. \n               Devil in the detail \n             Lofty goals aside, observers of the directorate say Cohen still has plenty of mundane problems to deal with. Proposals still take up to 90 days to wind their way through the directorate's acquisitions branch, says Jill Hruby, director of homeland security programmes at Sandia National Laboratories in Livermore, California. \u201cIt's still a long way from being a well-oiled production,\u201d she says. The directorate also draws regular fire from Congress for management shortcomings \u2014 most recently earlier this month , when the House Committee on Science and Technology blasted the directorate for neglecting a radiological lab in Manhattan. Congress is impatiently awaiting a five-year plan, and Wu says that he would also like to see a more comprehensive assessment of how it determines the greatest national risks. The clock is ticking, says Grossman. Cohen is a political appointee, and his two-year term will end in 2008, when a new president is elected. Given the number of problems facing the directorate, she says, expectations should be realistic. \u201cIf Cohen just gets started,\u201d she says, \u201cit will be a good use of two years.\u201d \n                     Locals rally to combat biodefence labs \n                   \n                     Research mired in Homeland Security delays \n                   \n                     Bioterrorism: Agriculture shock \n                   \n                     Homeland-security research: Mission impossible? \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

A US National Institutes of Health (NIH) study into brain development during childhood is creating a database as a benchmark against which researchers on other studies can compare their data. Scientists will be able to apply to the NIH for access to the database once it is ready, probably before the end of the year. They could, for example, compare structural or behavioural data from their studies of a mental disorder against those for children with 'normal' brains. The study, called the MRI Study of Normal Brain Development, is building a database of what constitutes a 'normal' child. Five hundred children aged from 7 days to 18 years, and representative of US society, have been recruited from six centres. Those with, or at risk of, any neurological or psychiatric disorders were screened out of the study. All were given a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan, which shows the size of the brain's structures and the densities of grey and white matter, as well as tracks of fibres connecting areas in the brain. The children also took behavioural and cognitive tests. The first results of the study, on neuropsychological tests in 6\u201318-year-olds, were published on 18 May (D. P. Waber  et al .  J. Int. Neuropsychol. Soc.  doi:10.1017/S1355617707070841; 2007). They show that cognitive skills improve between the ages of 6 and 10 but level off during adolescence \u2014 contradicting a widespread belief that cognitive development 'spurts' during adolescence. Researchers also confirmed that children's abilities in some cognitive tasks differ between boys and girls, and that cognitive performance correlates positively with parental income.

Worms and flies are to be enlisted by researchers attempting to make sense of the instructions embedded in the human genome. Since 2003, geneticists in the United States have been engaged in the pilot phase of a project called ENCODE \u2014 the Encyclopedia of DNA elements \u2014 which aims to catalogue all the functional parts of the human genome at a cost of around US$20 million a year. Now, a four-year, $57 million project called modENCODE will add roundworms ( Caenorhabditis elegans ) and fruitflies ( Drosophila melanogaster ) to the mix. By analysing these trusty model organisms, scientists hope to make better sense of the human-genome data gleaned from ENCODE. Grants from modENCODE will support scientists who are cataloguing the major types of functional genetic elements. These include RNAs that cut genetic transcripts into different genes and fine-tune gene expression, modifications to bundles of protein and DNA called chromatin, and DNA sequences that control how and when genes are transcribed. Researchers say that the project, which was announced by the US National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) on 14 May, is needed because ENCODE has shown that the human genome is even more complex than they originally thought (see  Nature   441 , 398\u2013401; 2006). ENCODE's pilot phase covered just 1% of the human genome and has generated a slew of techniques for analysing the genome. \u201cWe now have a portfolio of technologies that can be applied with high specificity and sensitivity to decode the parts list of the human genome at a rather precise level,\u201d says Francis Collins, the NHGRI's director. So far, the project has revealed that genes are regulated by complicated networks that span huge portions of the genome; that RNA plays a previously unappreciated part in determining how proteins are made from genes; and that scientists don't fully understand some of the regulatory motifs that they have been studying for years. Scientists hope that modENCODE will enable them to work out these processes by looking at the model organisms, which have much smaller genomes than humans and are easier to manipulate in the lab. The roundworm has about 100 million base pairs in its genome and the fruitfly 180 million, compared with 3 billion base pairs found in the human genome. \u201cThese are hard issues, and without the experimental feedback you can get from worms and flies, it's hard to see when we're really going to touch ground,\u201d says Robert Waterston of the University of Washington in Seattle and recipient of a $5.4-million modENCODE grant to study  C. elegans . But at the end of modENCODE's first four years, will scientists be able to pat themselves on the back and move on to something else? It's unlikely, they say, given that human genetics seems to evolve into a more complicated subject with every new foray into the genome. \u201cWe should get a lot closer,\u201d says Lincoln Stein of Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in New York, and the head of a new centre to coordinate the modENCODE data. \u201cIf we can't nail it down, we'll at least have a lot of it thumbtacked to the wall.\u201d \n                     Genetics: What is a gene? \n                   \n                     Gene regulation: The brave new world of RNA \n                   \n                     Nature \u201cFeature\u201d: \u201cA vision for the future of genomics research.\u201c \n                   \n                     Nature Omics Gateway \n                   \n                     NGHRI ENCODE project \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

The US National Hurricane Center in Miami, Florida, always uses the 1 June start date of the Atlantic hurricane season to remind coastal residents to be prepared for storms. But the lead-up to this year's season has exposed internal bickering and raised questions about whether the centre has the resources it needs. Just days before the federal government issued a dire prediction of an above-average hurricane season \u2014 similar to the 2006 prediction (see  table ) \u2014 the centre's director complained very publicly about the budget he had to track and forecast those storms. Bill Proenza, who came on board as centre director early this year, criticized his bosses for spending too much money on anniversary celebrations and not enough on replacing a key satellite \u2014 the Quick Scatterometer, or QuikSCAT. At the press briefing to announce hurricane predictions on 22 May, tensions ran high as Proenza shared the stage with the head of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), retired vice-admiral Conrad Lautenbacher. The spat reveals some long-simmering disputes between the various agencies that make up NOAA. The agency was cobbled together in 1970 from a number of existing groups (the oldest being the Coast and Geodetic Survey, which dates back to 1807 and is the basis for NOAA's '200th-anniversary' celebrations this year). As often with such unions, it hasn't always been a happy one. Proenza and some other researchers complain that NOAA is trying to usurp the identities of the individual services that make it up. The agency has, for example, proposed changing the names of the National Hurricane Center and its parent, the National Weather Service, to the NOAA Hurricane Center and the NOAA Weather Service. Disputes about service names may sound petty, but there are bigger underlying problems. Proenza charges that NOAA spent a disproportionate $4 million on anniversary celebrations aimed at outreach, and not enough on forecasting. NOAA's budget is roughly $4 billion; of that, $6 million goes to the hurricane centre. An agency spokesman disputes the outreach figure, saying it has amounted to only $1.5 million over two years, and Lautenbacher says the centre gets enough to do its job. \u201cThey both need more money,\u201d says James Baker, who headed NOAA between 1993 and 2001. He defends outreach, pointing out that the agency is not as well known as NASA even though its mission is arguably more critical to people's lives. \u201cI used to say, 'fund the weather service or die',\u201d he says. \u201cTrying to publicize and get the message out is good for both NOAA and the weather service.\u201d NOAA's $4-billion budget suffers particularly in comparison to NASA's $16 billion. Whereas the space agency is tasked with building and flying research satellites for Earth observation, NOAA is the agency in charge of turning them into long-term operational reality. In recent years, a series of reports from the National Research Council has identified problems in making smooth transitions from one to the other without loss of data in between. Of particular concern for hurricane forecasting is the QuikSCAT satellite, launched by NASA in 1999. An instrument known as SeaWinds aboard the satellite measures the direction and speed of winds by bouncing microwaves off the ocean surface and measuring them on their return to the satellite. The resulting data are used to improve hurricane forecasts as storms gather speed and change direction. But the satellite has passed its nominal five-year life, and Proenza has made a particular point of arguing for a successor. If SeaWinds failed, he says, the accuracy of three-day hurricane forecasts would drop by about 16%. A second version of SeaWinds was launched aboard the Japanese ADEOS-II satellite in 2003, but failed just months later. Another replacement, NASA's Ocean Vector Winds mission, was cancelled early this decade. In their place, Lautenbacher points to the joint military\u2013civilian Coriolis satellite. It carries an instrument known as WindSat, which uses a different technique from SeaWinds for detecting wind speeds and direction \u2014 rather than bouncing microwaves off the sea surface, it detects emission of microwaves from the surface. SeaWinds has better spatial resolution than WindSat and works better under weak winds and rainy conditions, says its principal investigator, Timothy Liu of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. But WindSat does some things that SeaWinds cannot \u2014 it can provide multiple sets of data simultaneously, counters its lead scientist, Peter Gaiser of the Naval Research Laboratory in Washington DC. Nevertheless, QuikSCAT is at least five years past the end of its nominal lifespan, and Congress has begun to get worried. Several members of Congress are pressuring NASA and NOAA for more details on what they plan to do when QuikSCAT fails. Any potential replacement would take time to put together. QuikSCAT itself was hastily pulled together and launched just two years after a previous instrument failed without warning, but only because key parts had already been built for other purposes. In the meantime, tensions will continue to bubble, although Lautenbacher makes the conflict seem welcome. \u201cYou have to remember that Mr Proenza just took over as the head of the hurricane centre, and he is known for being a very strong and forceful advocate for his programmes,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd that's one of the reasons why we love him.\u201d See also the News Feature on  \n                     page 522 \n                   . \n                     Torrid hurricane season in store \n                   \n                     The calm instead of the storm \n                   \n                     Atlantic hurricane season forecast high \n                   \n                     Meteorology: Bad weather ahead \n                   \n                     Tempers flare at hurricane meeting \n                   \n                     Hurricanes In Focus \n                   \n                     National Hurricane Center \n                   \n                     2007 Atlantic hurricane outlook \n                   \n                     Proposed changes to all NOAA websites \n                   \n                     NOAA history page \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},
{"file_id": "447512a", "url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/447512a", "year": 2007, "authors": [{"name": "Heidi Ledford"}], "parsed_as_year": "2006_or_before", "body": "A meta-analysis of clinical trials for the diabetes drug Avandia has hinted at possible cardiovascular risks; but how clear is the study, and how should meta-analyses be viewed against clinical trials? The day after concerns about Avandia hit the news, the emergency room at New York City's Bellevue Hospital was even more hectic than usual. Patients with diabetes filed in and asked to discontinue their medication while the phone rang with calls from other Avandia users. Harried doctors rushed to handle the extra flow. Cardiologist James Underberg found the scene disturbing. Although he insists that he is a clinician, not a statistician, Underberg could see that the analysis that suggested Avandia might be causing heart attacks was plagued by limitations \u2014 the authors of the paper said so themselves. But he could now be sued the next time he writes a prescription for Avandia, he says, \u201call on the basis of one article that may or may not have significant flaws in the analysis\u201d. The article, published last week (S. E. Nissen and K. Wolski  N. Engl. J. Med.  doi:10.1056/NEJMoa072761; 2007), is a meta-analysis of 42 clinical trials of rosiglitazone, a drug used to lower blood sugar in patients with diabetes and marketed under the name Avandia by London-based pharmaceutical giant GlaxoSmithKline (GSK). The authors, Steven Nissen and Kathy Wolski of the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio, found that the chance of having a heart attack was 43% higher in patients who were taking the drug than in those who weren't, although precisely why is unclear (see  'How Avandia works' ). These data do not differ strikingly from others that have come before; in Europe, Avandia comes with a warning label that the drug increases the risk of heart attack by 31%, on the basis of a previous meta-analysis, by GSK. But the new paper has caught a lot of attention.  The Lancet , which had earlier published the promising results of one of GSK's clinical trials of Avandia, responded with an editorial warning against alarmist responses to Nissen and Wolski's paper and its tone of \u201curgency\u201d ( Lancet  doi:10.1016/S0140-6736(07)60787-9; 2007). But by then, GSK's stock price had plummeted and congressional hearings had been scheduled to review the handling of the drug by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Meta-analyses, which crunch together the results of many clinical trials, are powerful statistical tools to uncover the side effects of drugs. They were key in bringing to light the increased chance of heart attack associated with the painkiller Vioxx (also highlighted by Nissen, see  'Man on a mission' ), and the added risk of suicidal thinking and behaviour in children taking some antidepressants. Few doubt that meta-analyses have their uses, but researchers caution that they should be read in the right light and, if possible, made more robust. The studies crunched together in this case were not designed to look for cardiovascular side effects, but rather to assess the drug's main activity. Reports of heart incidents may not have followed the same rigorous criteria in all studies, nor were they reviewed by an outside panel. And Nissen and Wolski had access only to the trials' summaries, and not to patient-specific data (GSK has posted such summaries online since an unrelated court case in 2004 prompted it to do so), so any confounding effects could not be taken into account. If the cardiovascular risks are only for a specific subset of patients, this meta-analysis won't be able to tell. To make such studies more robust, more data are needed. John Ioannidis, an epidemiologist at the University of Ioannina School of Medicine in Greece who has examined numerous meta-analyses notes that journal articles reporting clinical trials tend to dedicate more space to listing the authors' names than to listing possible side effects associated with the drug. And studies that produce negative results are often not published at all, giving researchers an incomplete picture of how often trials fail. Ioannidis argues that use of complete data sets would strengthen the analysis and could weed out potential false alarms. \u201cI think that companies would actually gain from such transparencies,\u201d he says. He adds that meta-analyses should be done by independent groups. At the moment, they are frequently conducted as part of the drug approval process. But in many such cases, the analysis is being done by the pharmaceutical companies that manufacture the drug in question \u2014 something that most agree is not a good idea. \u201cIf I saw a meta-analysis done by GSK on Avandia, I don't think I would believe it,\u201d says Ioannidis. \u201cSomeone who is independent should do this.\u201d But GSK doesn't think that crunching studies together is in itself the best way to find side-effects. \u201cWe don't think meta-analysis is the best way to address this,\u201d says GSK spokeswoman Alice Hunt. Clinical trials, she argues, are the only way to achieve a definitive answer. GSK is in the middle of a clinical trial of more than 4,000 patients that is aimed specifically at assessing the cardiovascular effects of Avandia (compared with more than 10,000 patients in Nissen's number crunch).  The Lancet  editorial also recommends waiting for these results \u2014 although the news of the new findings has reportedly led to volunteers dropping out of the trial. Preliminary results of the trial, scheduled to finish in 2008, have been shared with the FDA, says Hunt. \u201cThey could potentially be released, but that's not being looked at, at the moment,\u201d she adds. The FDA will not as yet comment on the ongoing trial, to \u201cpreserve the study integrity\u201d, but it does have additional data on the drug. Without seeing the results for themselves, some doctors find it hard to know how to judge FDA assurances that the additional data it has do not point to a significant risk of heart attack. \u201cThey are unpublished, uncited data that are not available to the public. I've heard the same story before: 'We know there are weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. We can't tell you how we know, but we know',\u201d says Nissen. For some, even a preliminary analysis is reason enough to avoid the drug, if only because there is an alternative medication \u2014 pioglitazone, marketed under the name Actos in the United States \u2014 that has not yet been associated with cardiovascular risks. Nissen's analysis was enough to convince Harlan Krumholz, a cardiologist at Yale University: \u201cWhen you're talking about safety and you're talking about a drug for which there are alternatives, you have to ask yourself, who has the burden of proof here?\u201d Although Avandia's fate remains unclear, Nissen's study has served to raise the profile of meta-analyses. Roger Chou, a clinician at the Oregon Evidence-based Practice Center in Portland notes that at the moment, independent analyses such as this are done on an ad-hoc basis. \u201cRight now, it's really just when somebody's interested in it, or when there's something that's making people concerned,\u201d he says. But there is a growing interest in independent groups monitoring drug safety in this way \u2014 and, importantly, signs of increased funding from organizations such as the US Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality to support meta-analyses. \n                     Review uncovers new killer drug \n                   \n                     Vioxx may trigger heart attacks within days \n                   \n                     Journal grows suspicious of Vioxx data \n                   \n                     FDA considers antidepressant risks for kids \n                   \n                     Analysis highlights suicide risk of antidepressants \n                   \n                     Nature Medicine  blog \n                   \n                     Nature Reviews Drug Discovery \n                   \n                     Clinical Trials Database \n                   \n                     GlaxoSmithKline Avandia page \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

This February, Laura Scott, a genetic epidemiologist at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, spent her holiday sitting in a ski lodge in front of her computer, \u201cvery occasionally trying to go out and ski\u201d. She was working on one of three papers that appeared online in  Science  in April, the same day that a competing group announced similar findings in  Nature Genetics 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 . All four papers identify genes implicated in adult-onset diabetes, one of western society's commonest ailments. And all four are part of a new genetics gold rush that uses such 'genome-wide association studies' to flag disease-related genes. Hence Scott's indoor skiing trip: \u201cThe feeling was: 'It's gotta get out there',\u201d she says. As in any gold rush, prospectors are pursuing the spoils as quickly as their tools, skills and finances will allow. This week,  Nature  publishes the biggest pot of gold yet: a report tagging more than 20 genetic markers associated with seven common diseases, from bipolar disorder to hypertension, teased out from the DNA of 17,000 people (see  page 661 ). Science is always competitive. But human genetics is going through a particularly intense burst of activity. The race is to identify single-letter DNA variations that are more frequent in patients with common, complex diseases and thus serve as markers for susceptibility. Technological advances that have come fully on-line only in the past 18 months are allowing geneticists to examine common diseases such as diabetes, which are caused by both environmental influences and by an unknown number of genes that contribute to different degrees. To find these small genetic influences, scientists must screen a thousand or more patients with each disease for hundreds of thousands of single-letter markers, and compare the results against similar screens of people without the disease. Such studies are still expensive \u2014 costing, at minimum, nearly a million dollars \u2014 and there are only a limited number of strong genetic associations to be found for the most common diseases. So the race is on to be first to pick and publish this low-hanging fruit, which many expect to be collected within a year or two. \u201cIf you've invested a large amount of money and a lot of time in doing one of these studies, you don't want to publish your paper a month after someone else has found the same things,\u201d says statistician Peter Donnelly of the University of Oxford, who is chairman of the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium and a lead author on today's study. Many scientists, including Donnelly, welcome the competition. A host of suspect genes published in the early days of the rush have turned out to be false positives. The way that results today are being confirmed through multiple, overlapping findings published near-simultaneously by competing groups \u201cis fantastic for the field\u201d, says Donnelly. In some cases, the prospectors are working together in the hope of improving their claims. The authors of the three papers on diabetes that appeared in  Science , for instance, agreed months before publication to pool their initial data to improve their chances of identifying truly significant genetic variants. A working group at the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) that today publishes a set of proposed standards for genome-wide association studies (see  page 655 ) stresses the desirability of simultaneously publishing independent replication of results. It notes, however, that some work may be so important as to justify its publication before it has been replicated. The results published by Donnelly and colleagues today do not include independent replication. \u201cThe referees were unanimous that this advance was powerful enough as a landmark not to necessitate the conditions recommended by the NIH,\u201d says Philip Campbell,  Nature 's editor-in-chief. Indeed, the pace of the field means that several other groups have already confirmed and published some genetic links highlighted in this paper. Many of these findings will lead to genetic tests to identify those at greater risk of common disease.

India's largest research agency has been without a permanent director for almost five months, prompting some observers to claim that science isn't high on the government's agenda. The role of director of the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), which runs 37 laboratories staffed by more than 18,000 scientists, comes with the status of a government secretary. It became vacant last December when chemist Raghunath Mashelkar quit the post \u2014 and the hunt for a successor has got nowhere fast. Science minister Kapil Sibal initially appointed Visveswaraiah Prakash, director of the CSIR's Central Food Technological Research Institute in Mysore, but he withdrew on health grounds. Maharaj Kishan Bhan, the government's biotechnology secretary, took temporary charge in January, but after eight weeks he passed the responsibility to Thirumalachari Ramasami, secretary of the Department of Science and Technology. India's prime minister, Manmohan Singh, keeps saying the government gives priority to science, says Sri Krishna Joshi, director of the CSIR from 1991 to 1995. \u201cBut one does not get the feeling he is serious, considering that the CSIR, of which he himself is president, has been headless for so long.\u201d Scientists blame the declining prestige of public research as one reason for the failure to appoint a director. \u201cUntil a few years ago, the only way for a scientist to get noticed was by becoming a secretary to a scientific department,\u201d says Samir Brahmachari, who heads the CSIR's genomics institute in New Delhi. \u201cToday, with opportunities to do good science outside the government, no brilliant scientist would want to be a secretary and be answerable to the parliament and all sorts of committees.\u201d Scientists at the CSIR agree that it's a difficult job. During Mashelkar's eleven years as director, unions were banned and complaints from staff were rarely entertained. \u201cThe new director should be ready to deal with the thousands of complaints that have piled up,\u201d says one lab director who wants to remain anonymous. \n                     Is India's 'patent factory' squandering funds? \n                   \n                     India's finest, for hire \n                   \n                     Welcome to CSIR: Council of Scientific and Industrial Research \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Operated by the University of Southern California, the centre's biggest loss was about 100 million oyster larvae, which were being used in a genomics study to examine gene expression in various environments. With power out, electrical seawater pumps could not be operated, so the larvae were put to sea. Staff members imported boatloads of dry ice to save a decade's worth of frozen specimens.

Canada's main funding agency for health research has adopted ethics guidelines for studies involving the estimated one million indigenous people in the country. Researchers and tribal leaders are optimistic that the guidelines will help to speed up the investigation of health problems among Canadian aboriginals, whose life expectancy has been estimated to be between five and eight years shorter than that of other Canadians. This is due in part to a greater susceptibility to diabetes, cardiovascular disease and mental-health problems. The guidelines \u2014 the first to offer a comprehensive framework for researchers working with aboriginal communities \u2014 state that scientists should focus on the collective interests of the community in planning their studies. For example, they must obtain consent for projects from the community involved, as well as from individuals. Biological samples should be considered \u201con loan\u201d to the researcher, and the community should have the opportunity to review the conclusions drawn from the data. \u201cThis is a big step forward,\u201d says Alan Bernstein, president of the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR), the main federal funding agency for health research and the author of the guidelines. Until now, Canadian researchers working with indigenous people have relied on the guidance in a 1998 human research ethics statement issued by the Tri-Council (see  Nature   395 , 420; doi:10.1038/265681998 ), a body comprising three federal research agencies, of which the CIHR is one. Ethicists have said that its comments on indigenous peoples are inadequate, and agencies have long recognized the need to beef up the guidance. \u201cStandards were quite uneven across the country,\u201d says Jeff Reading, scientific director of the Institute of Aboriginal Peoples' Health (IAPH), which is part of the CIHR. The guidelines were prepared by the Ethics Office of the CIHR and the IAPH, in partnership with the aboriginal communities of First Nations, Inuit and M\u00e9tis. A working group surveyed the research guidelines developed in other countries and by aboriginal groups to explore the issues raised by research involving aboriginal people. Although the recommendations are not legally binding, health researchers and institutions funded by the CIHR will be required to follow them. The relationship between researchers and aboriginal communities has been problematic in the past. So-called fly-in researchers would come into communities, take samples, and never be seen again. The issue was thrust into the public eye in 2000, when the Nuu-chah-nulth, a First Nations community living on Vancouver Island, British Columbia, discovered that DNA samples collected between 1982 and 1985 to study the high incidence of rheumatic disease in the community had been later used in other research projects, including an anthropological study that was not part of the original consent (R. H. Ward  et al .  Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA   88,  8720\u20138724; 1991). Global genetics projects such as the Human Genome Diversity Project and the Genographic Project, which both explore human origins and migrations, have also met with opposition from aboriginal groups, partly because there were no obvious benefits to the community. \n                     Tribe blasts 'exploitation' of blood samples \n                   \n                     Canadian collaboration aims to protect tribes \n                   \n                     Bioprospectors turn their gaze to Canada \n                   \n                     Tri-council policy statement \n                   \n                     Canadian Institutes of Health Research \n                   \n                     Sandy Lake Health and Diabetes Project \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Computer scientists at Columbia University in New York have used a mathematical model to estimate the number of flawed scientific papers that go unretracted, and its relation to journal impact factors. In correspondence published in  EMBO Reports  (M. Cokol  et al .  EMBO Rep.   5 , 422\u2013423; 2007), the researchers find that fewer papers are retracted by journals with low impact factors. But their model raises as many questions as it answers, say specialists in scientific publishing, some of whom argue that it greatly oversimplifies the issues. Murat Cokol and his colleagues at the biomedical-informatics department at Columbia downloaded data for 9.4 million articles published between 1950 and 2004 from PubMed, an index of biomedical and general scientific literature. They identified 596 retracted articles \u2014 flagged up as such in PubMed \u2014 and found some striking relationships between the numbers of retractions and the impact factors of the journals that had published them. Journals with high impact factors retract more papers, and low-impact journals are more likely not to retract them, the study finds. It also suggests that high- and low-impact journals differ little in detecting flawed articles before they are published. Finally, the authors ran a model to estimate how many articles should have been retracted, and came up with 10,000 in a best-case scenario and more than 100,000 in a worst-case one. Most of the papers that needed to be retracted were published in low-impact journals. The Cokol study was not peer-reviewed. Aviv Bergman, director of the Center for Computational Genetics and Biological Modeling at Stanford University in California, says that the researchers' modelling techniques are sound, but that he isn't in a position to judge their input data. But scientists and editors familiar with retraction issues are sceptical of the quality of the model's input data. Theoretical modelling exercises will generate bad results if the input data are flawed, says Drummond Rennie, deputy editor of the  Journal of the American Medical Association , and a medical researcher at the Institute for Health Policy Studies, at the University of California, San Francisco. Although the number of retracted articles is probably only the tip of the iceberg in terms of the number that should have been retracted, the model \u2014 based on journal impact factor and number of retractions \u2014 is too simplistic to capture the complex reality of the issues affecting the size and nature of the hidden part, Rennie says. The model clumps data from 1950 to 2004, for example, whereas trends are likely to be affected by the fact that the United States first introduced official policies on research misconduct twenty years ago, and that other nations did so even later, says Rennie. Experience also shows that retraction figures are skewed by the fact that once misconduct is detected in one article by a researcher, dozens of articles by the same author often need to be retracted. \u201cDigging into the data behind all these other articles is a truly monumental task, but until it's done, no one has much clue what the real number of retractions should be,\u201d says Rennie. Impact factor alone is also a very broad yardstick, says one scientific-literature specialist at PubMed, who points out that the impact factors of individual articles vary widely, even when they are in the same journal. Other models could also be made to fit the data with potentially very different outcomes, he says. High-impact journals might attract flawed papers, he speculates, simply because they publish cutting-edge research, in which competition and time pressure may favour both errors and misconduct. In the correspondence, Cokol argues that the larger number of retractions in high-impact journals reflects the fact that they receive more scrutiny. But Sandra Titus, director of intramural research at the US Office of Research Integrity in Rockville, Maryland, says that's too simple a verdict. \u201cIt's only part of the issue,\u201d she says, adding that \u201clegal barriers to retraction are so awkward that many journals simply pass rather than face the hassle.\u201d Cokol defends his approach as a valid one to start exploring data on retraction. \u201cAll models are wrong, but some are useful,\u201d he says. \u201cOur model certainly does not capture the reality in full, and no model does. But it captures certain aspects and gives a general direction on how to understand the issue better.\u201d \n                     Journal reveals plans to fight fraud \n                   \n                     Correction or retraction? \n                   \n                     Should journals police scientific fraud? \n                   \n                     Special Report: Taking on the cheats \n                   \n                     Dubious data remain in print two years after misconduct inquiry \n                   \n                     US Office of Research Integrity \n                   \n                     Columbia University Biomedical Informatics \n                   \n                     PubMed \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Purdue University has set up a third panel to look at allegations of research misconduct against nuclear engineer Rusi Taleyarkhan. The existence of the latest inquiry emerged when a congressional committee wrote to the university questioning the thoroughness of its earlier review. Now Purdue, based in West Lafayette, Indiana, faces an uphill task in convincing the wider scientific community that it is mounting a serious investigative effort, critics say. Since 1999, Taleyarkhan has received more than $780,000 from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) for work towards the goal of 'bubble fusion', in which energy-releasing fusion reactions are triggered by passing ultrasound through deuterated liquids 1 . In February, Purdue cleared him of misconduct after two inquiries 2 , 3 . But a third panel was set up in March following complaints to the inspector-general of the Office of Naval Research, which oversees DARPA grants. Its existence came to light on 10 May, in a memo from the investigations and oversight subcommittee of the House Committee on Science and Technology, chaired by Brad Miller (Democrat, North Carolina). \u201cI sincerely hope that the next inquiry will be conducted in a manner worthy of your great institution,\u201d Miller wrote to Purdue president Martin Jischke. A subcommittee-staff memo sent with his letter alleges that Purdue's previous efforts on the issue were \u201cnot thorough\u201d, \u201cnever addressed the validity of the underlying research\u201d and \u201cdid not follow\u201d established procedures for investigating misconduct allegations. The criticisms are partly based on the subcommittee's analysis of internal Purdue documents that it requested in March. According to the memo, these documents show that in March 2006, Purdue charged a panel with determining the facts surrounding articles published in  Nature  and elsewhere that reported concerns over the validity of Taleyarkhan's research. This first panel reviewed a limited number of documents, interviewed only two professors inside Purdue, and concluded its work by recommending further interviews and examination of lab notebooks, the memo says. University officials then set up a second inquiry panel that, according to the memo, did not seem to follow the recommendations of the first, but instead solicited and examined a narrower set of allegations. The memo reports that the second panel concluded that Taleyarkhan showed \u201cwhat might be characterized most favorably as severe lack of judgment\u201d when he participated in the preparation of a manuscript by a postdoc and a graduate student that claimed positive results for bubble fusion and did not name him as an author. Taleyarkhan then cited the work as \u201cindependent\u201d confirmation of his own earlier research claims. The claim would not be accepted by the wider scientific community, the inquiry found. The memo says that the inquiry found Taleyarkhan had \u201cabused his privilege as senior scientist\u201d and placed the junior scientists in \u201cprecarious positions\u201d. But the inquiry concluded that no full-scale investigation into the possibility of misconduct or the underlying research was warranted and the university then cleared Taleyarkhan of wrong-doing in a press release. Immediately after the release of Miller's letter and the accompanying memo, Purdue issued a statement saying that although it \u201ccould debate\u201d some of its contents, the university would instead focus on its fresh inquiry. Taleyarkhan's long time co-author, Richard Lahey of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, New York, took issue with the memo, saying that he had full confidence in Taleyarkhan's abilities and integrity and that the true story was one of \u201can exciting scientific discovery\u201d. He criticized congressional staff members for failing to contact him or Taleyarkhan's other co-authors as a part of their own inquiries. Purdue's new inquiry is understood to be covering some of the ground omitted by earlier ones, including allegations that Taleyarkhan's work may be fraudulent, a concern first received by the university in June 2006. The new panel consists of unnamed panellists from the previous inquiries, because, Purdue says, these people are \u201cfamiliar with the issues\u201d. In its statement, Purdue pledged to add one or more outside scientists to the panel. But that may not be enough to restore credibility in the university's process, says C. K. Gunsalus, a lawyer at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign who specializes in research misconduct. \u201cThey need to completely reconstitute the process. Different panellists, including at least one external to the institution, are required to restore faith in their findings. It's the only way to close the matter.\u201d Gunsalus says the case raises a broader issue of how officials respond to misconduct accusations. \u201cThere's an unwillingness to be embarrassed,\u201d she says. \u201cPeople can make intuitive, but mistaken, decisions counter to the underlying interest, which is the integrity of the institution.\u201d Purdue says that it will continue to adhere to its own policy and to federal guidelines. Responding to Purdue's statement, Taleyarkhan said: \u201cI have confirmed my full and complete cooperation with the new inquiry to be introduced this year at Purdue and, in fact, welcome the opportunity to once again clear up the doubts raised in the press.\u201d At Purdue, nuclear-engineering faculty expressed mixed feelings about the affair. Chan Choi, who chaired a fact-finding internal committee that looked into the authorship issues, says that institutional blunders should not overshadow the ample sound research performed at the university. \u201cI think they have to make the charges clear and I think the committee's names should be known,\u201d he says. But he adds that the outside interest has provided an opportunity for the university to improve its procedure now: \u201cThat's a healthy message from Congress.\u201d \n                     Bubble fusion: silencing the hype \n                   \n                     Disputed inquiry clears bubble-fusion engineer \n                   \n                     Purdue University, Rusi Taleyarkhan's web page \n                   \n                     Fact-finding Report by Purdue's Nuclear Engineering Faculty (hosted by nytimes.com) \n                   \n                     Congressional Subcommittee press release \n                   \n                     Brad Miller's Letter \n                   \n                     Congressional Subcommittee Memo \n                   \n                     Purdue University's Statement \n                   \n                     New York Times timeline and resources \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

A United Nations (UN) meeting has failed to agree on an action plan to deal with indoor air pollution \u2014 the range of hazards related to cooking indoors that is thought to kill more people every year in poor countries than malaria. Despite two weeks of negotiations in New York, the UN Commission on Sustainable Development was unable to ratify a draft communiqu\u00e9 on indoor pollution and other developmental issues that were up for discussion. But activists say the very fact that the discussion took place represents valuable progress in acknowledging the scale of the pollution problem. At the end of a fractious meeting that culminated in the election of the Zimbabwean environment minister, Francis Nhema, to chair the commission, representatives from Switzerland and the European Union (EU) rejected the draft communiqu\u00e9, saying that its vacuous content would threaten past agreements and contained no goals that would spur action on a number of key issues. \u201cIn previous discussions, the problem of indoor air pollution has been basically invisible, perhaps because it is a situation that affects mainly women,\u201d says Maria Arce Moreira, a policy adviser to Practical Action, a British pressure group that works on poverty issues. \u201cIt's important that it is finally recognized as a problem, but the proposed actions to deal with it are not enough.\u201d Around half of the world's population cooks on stoves that burn biomass such as wood, crop residues or dung, development specialists say. According to estimates from the World Health Organization (WHO), smoke emitted by traditional cookers kills 1.6 million people each year, most of them women and children (WHO  Indoor Air Pollution: National Burden of Disease Estimates ; 2007). Researchers predict that if these trends continue, in Africa alone indoor air pollution will kill 10 million people by 2030. Of these deaths, up to 3.7 million could be saved by switching to petroleum-based fossil fuels such as kerosene (R. Bailis  et al .  Science   308 , 98\u2013103; 2005). Lung cancer, pneumonia and acute lowerrespiratory infections are prevalent as a result of constant exposure to carbon monoxide, particulates, hydrocarbons and carcinogens such as formaldehyde and benzene that are contained in cooking smoke. Activist groups, including Practical Action, have previously called on governments to adopt firm measures to halve the number of people cooking with traditional fuels. But with fossil-fuel prices at historic highs, and most of the world's poorest people using wood-burning stoves, there is little appetite for such measures. Nonetheless, EU representatives wanted the UN commission to ask nations and regions to set appropriate targets, \u201cbecause without targets you cannot easily review these issues\u201d, says Natascha Beinker, a policy adviser at the German ministry for economic cooperation and development, who attended the meetings. EU representatives also called for a commitment to switching to cleaner biofuels, and to delivering financial aid and addressing the health risks from indoor cooking, \u201cbut there was not total commitment for this\u201d, Beinker adds. \u201cThe Americans and Australians seem less willing to accept that there is a policy issue,\u201d says Andrew Scott, policy director for Practical Action. African and South American nations, which see environmental rules as restraints on their economic development, agreed that the issue was not a political one and blocked the EU move. Peter Davies, an energy adviser to the UK Department for International Development, who was also at the meetings, argues that progress remains possible without firm targets. \u201cGoals and targets are not something developed countries can push on. These are issues that national governments need to decide for themselves with their own national-development and poverty-reduction plans.\u201d This year's meeting of the sustainable-development commission concentrated on four main issues \u2014 energy, industrial development, air pollution and climate change. The most contentious debate was fuelled by discussions on acceptable sources of energy. \u201cThe EU and First World groups tended to be influenced by environmental issues, whereas the G77 [the developing nations] seemed to take a much harder-nosed look at what they need for their economic development,\u201d says Davies. The lack of consensus means that rather than producing a final summary agreed by all countries, this year's chair, Abdullah bin Hamad al-Attiyah of Qatar, will issue a text that merely lists the points discussed. \u201cThe final text will be very watered down now,\u201d says Arce Moreira. \u201cWe do not envisage support for energy issues related to indoor air pollution, such as addressing access to modern energy for the poor.\u201d But Davies says that what matters is that the hitherto obscure issue of indoor pollution is gradually raising its political profile. \u201cWhatever the chair's summary says will be pretty bland. It has been negotiated to the lowest common denominator. But I think it will be a mistake to look at the chair's summary and say this is it,\u201d he says. \u201cThe process and the debate it generates has value in itself.\u201d \n                     Charcoal fuel gets green light \n                   \n                     Biomass fuels blamed for premature deaths in rural settings \n                   \n                     WHO: Indoor air pollution: national burden of disease estimates \n                   \n                     Practical Action \n                   \n                     German Federal Ministry For Economic Cooperation and Development \n                   \n                     Department for International Development \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

The Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI) is one of the wealthiest philanthropic organizations supporting biomedical research, but Dora Angelaki didn't want to become one of its investigators just for the money. With funding from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and NASA, her neurobiology lab at Washington University in St Louis, Missouri, is hardly starved for cash. What she wanted was to embark on riskier projects that would be difficult to sell to conservative, federal research agencies. So when her colleagues encouraged her to enter the HHMI competition, she was eager to give it a go. Unfortunately, as Angelaki soon discovered, the competition is open only to academic researchers who have been running a lab for between four and ten years. Angelaki has been at it since November 1993. And even with the two extra years that the HHMI allows to compensate for the fact that she had two children during that time, Angelaki missed the window by 18 months. Her exclusion highlights what critics claim is a persistent problem for women scientists trying to become an HHMI investigator. Some argue that the institute's nominating practices and restrictive time limits hinder such career development \u2014 issues that the HHMI itself has recognized and taken steps to correct. But questions persist as to whether these steps go far enough. \u201cThey've taken a huge step forward,\u201d says Ben Barres, a neurobiologist at Stanford University in California. \u201cBut they still need to diversify their selection committees. And I think this four-to-ten-year window works very strongly against women.\u201d As a result of changes put forward in 2005 by the institute's president, Thomas Cech, the current competition is the first in which individuals can directly apply to the HHMI, rather than having to be nominated by a university. This is intended to make the process more open to women, minority groups and young scientists. Nevertheless, some researchers would like the HHMI to go further. Barres says it should extend its window of eligibility from 10 to 16 years, to lessen the disadvantage faced by women who have had children soon after becoming assistant professors. But HHMI spokeswoman Avice Meehan says that the 10-year limit is important to enable the institute to maintain a pool of early-career investigators. And, she adds, applicants for the investigator competition are eligible for extensions on the basis of childcare, parent care or military service. At present, 62 out of 299 HHMI investigators are female. That's not much different from the balance in the pool of faculty members from which the HHMI draws its candidates: at US research universities, women accounted for 30% of assistant and associate professors and just less than 20% of full professors in the life sciences in 2003, according to the National Academies. That means it will be hard to dramatically change the percentage at the HHMI, concedes Nancy Hopkins, a developmental biologist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge. But Hopkins thinks it would be a good idea if the HHMI put more women on its powerful executive boards. \u201cIt's these powerful organizations and the people at the top that are really visible and send a strong message,\u201d she says. Two of the eight members of the medical advisory board and four of the nineteen members of the scientific review board are female. Among the ten HHMI executive officers, Meehan is the only woman. \u201cThat is a male organization,\u201d Hopkins says. \u201cIt just is.\u201d Cech has already pledged to increase the percentage of women on the review panels that select investigators. These panels have been between 22% and 30% female, but the panel for the 2008 competition has not yet been selected, says Meehan. The community will be watching closely to see whether the present changes have the intended effect, but for Angelaki, they are too late. When she got notice that she was not eligible to become an HHMI investigator, she sent an e-mail back. \u201cThank you for your response,\u201d she wrote. \u201cIt's too bad for both of us.\u201d \n                     Baby blues \n                   \n                     German foundation helps women juggle science and family \n                   \n                     Does gender matter? \n                   \n                     Starting at the top \n                   \n                     Complaints of gender bias compel NIH to revise awards scheme \n                   \n                     Mums in Science forum \n                   \n                     HHMI 2008 Investigator Competition announcement \n                   \n                     NIH Pioneer Award \n                   \n                     National Academy of Sciences \u201cBeyond Bias and Barriers\u201d report on women in science and engineering \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

The directors of the Natural History Museum in London are under fire over plans to split parts of its world-renowned collection of biological specimens on a permanent basis. Some of the museum's curators are angry that plans for a new building to store the bulk of the museum's entomology and botany collections remain unaltered three years after being branded unfit for the purpose by museum staff. Work has now started on the \u00a373-million (US$140-million) building for the Darwin Centre Phase Two, even though there won't be space to house all of the museum's 28 million insect specimens and 5.5 million plants. The structure will replace the previous Entomology Building, which was demolished in 2006: it had been impregnated with potentially cancer-causing naphthalene, which helped to preserve specimens. \u201cOur first gripe is that they wilfully destroyed a sound building without looking at the alternatives,\u201d says Henry Barlow, an entomologist who contributed some 30,000 specimens to the museum's collections and a member of Friends of the Natural History Museum, a group of donors and visitors that liaises with museum staff. Barlow accuses the museum of being more interested in winning architectural awards than properly curating its collections. Museum directors found that refurbishing the previous building was not cost-effective, says the museum's head of collections, Mike Fitton. He says when the new building opens in 2009, it will offer better conditions for specimens, better research facilities and improved public access, so visitors can see the museum's research in action. \u201cThe collections have not lost out to architecture \u2014 they have lost to these three aspirations,\u201d he told  Nature . The Friends of the Natural History Museum will meet with museum director Michael Dixon on 22 May to discuss the plans. \u201cSome fairly pointed questions need to be asked,\u201d says Barlow. Chief among these will be why the new storage facility, known as the 'cocoon' after its curving walls encased in an eight-storey glass box, will have only 3.4 kilometres of shelving for storing specimens, even though a 2001 report by the museum's trustees said that 4.6 kilometres of shelving was required. Fitton says the museum commissioned a study at the project's inception in 1999 to evaluate the idea of storing all the collections under one roof. But with the selected design, by Danish firm C. F. M\u00f8ller Architects, this was considered impractical, and the 2004 unveiling of the design to museum workers was met with anger (see  Nature   432 , 659; 2004). Researchers' fears for the collections are exacerbated by the fact that the specimens are currently being kept at the museum's overspill facility in Wandsworth, southwest London. Barlow says this building is prone to high humidity and is below the flood level of the nearby River Thames, but museum officials say conditions are first-class. It remains unclear whether some specimens will stay in Wandsworth permanently after the new building opens, or whether space will be found elsewhere on the museum's main campus in central London. Of the 129,000 drawers in which the entomology collection currently sits, there will be room for 120,000 in the Darwin Centre, says Fitton. \u201cWe could have squeezed all the insects in but that would be silly,\u201d he says, because the collection is expected to grow by around 10% during the life of any storage facility. Meanwhile, museum directors say the public will get an unprecedented insight into how the institution's painstaking taxonomic research is carried out. Planned attractions include an 'Explore tour', which will take visitors through selected parts of the collection and labs, and the David Attenborough studio, named after the well-known zoologist and broadcaster, which promises face-to-face interaction with museum staff. \n                     Aboriginal remains head for home \n                   \n                     Curators bugged by museum's vision for insect collection \n                   \n                     Natural History Museum on Nature Network \n                   \n                     Nature Network London \n                   \n                     Ecology and evolution news \n                   \n                     Lab life news \n                   \n                     Policy news \n                   \n                     Natural History Museum \n                   \n                     Darwin Centre \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Scientists from around the world have urged the Canadian government to take action to protect its northern landscapes. They claim that development is threatening one of the last great tracts of woods and wetlands on Earth. In a 14 May letter delivered to Bob Mills, chair of the environment committee in Canada's House of Commons, 1,521 scientists from 51 countries asked the Canadian government to support the principles that were laid out in the 2003 Boreal Forest Conservation Framework. That agreement between industry, indigenous people and conservation groups said that at least half of the 6 million square kilometres of boreal region should be off-limits to development, and the rest should be managed sustainably. The boreal region contains forest, wetland and other landscapes, and covers much of northern Canada. The campaigners say that the region is crucial to ecosystems worldwide. It serves as a breeding ground for 3 billion migratory birds, and is an important source of fresh water and the largest terrestrial carbon sink on Earth. So far, it has sequestered more than 180 billion tonnes of carbon. One of the letter's signatories is Ken Caldeira, a climate modeller at the Carnegie Institution based at Stanford, California, who last month published a study suggesting that the total destruction of Canada's boreal forests would actually ease global warming (see  Nature , doi:10.1038/news070409-2; 2007). Some say that press coverage of the study raised public doubts about the need to conserve the boreal region. \u201cIt is certainly something we are struggling with,\u201d says Jeff Wells, science adviser for the International Boreal Conservation campaign in Seattle, Washington. Canadian prime minister Stephen Harper has said that he will designate almost 100,000 square kilometres of land in the Northwest Territories as protected, but those deals have yet to be finalized.

Geneticists at the genomics meeting in Cold Spring Harbor, New York, last week celebrated the success of the International HapMap project \u2014 and predicted its eventual demise. The project, unveiled in 2005, is a database of markers of genetic diversity called single nucleotide polymorphisms, or SNPs. By comparing HapMap data against SNPs from people with specific diseases, researchers hope to pinpoint the genetic glitches that underlie those diseases. Many studies have now been published that have used data from the HapMap project, which aims to cut down the cost and effort involved in finding the genetic errors that lead to common disorders such as heart problems, mental illness and diabetes. At the meeting, Peter Donnelly of the University of Oxford, UK, who is one of the investigators in the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium, presented findings from a major study the group conducted of seven common diseases in 16,179 participants. The study, expected to be published shortly, is perhaps the most ambitious trawl yet for common disease genes. And it did turn up possible genetic causes for some of the diseases, Donnelly said. Together with results from other 'genome-wide association studies', Donnelly's report had researchers toasting their successes, and hoping for more. \u201cFor ten years, we have been predicting that genome-wide association studies will work, and it is clear now that they do,\u201d says Ewan Birney, who runs the gene bank at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory in Cambridge, UK. \u201cWhat this meeting says to me is that we have got to do this in every disease that matters to us, including diseases of the developing world.\u201d But another message from the meeting was that tools not available at the dawn of the HapMap could soon make the project obsolete. Scientists described some of the first sequencing projects that use new technologies developed to decode DNA faster and more cheaply than ever before. The new technologies will allow researchers to compare many more types of variation than just SNPs, and in greater numbers of people. The fast sequencers available now \u2014 made by 454 Life Sciences in Connecticut, and Solexa in San Diego, California, both of which were acquired this year by larger corporations \u2014 enable scientists to read the genomes of small organisms in weeks, and of larger organisms in months. For instance, 454 is expected to announce shortly that its technology was able to start and complete the sequencing of the genome of geneticist James Watson between January and March. Over the next year, new rapid sequencers from Applied Biosystems in Foster City, California, and Helicos Biosciences in Cambridge, Massachusetts, are expected to make their debut. Once these quick sequencers become routine, it will obviate the need for tools such as the HapMap, scientists say. \u201cThe HapMap was a substitute until we could afford to do whole genomes,\u201d says plant genomicist Magnus Nordborg of the University of Southern California in Los Angeles. \n                     Broad sweep of genome zeroes in on diabetes \n                   \n                     The chips are down \n                   \n                     Special section on human genetics: The rough guide to the genome \n                   \n                     HapMap Web focus \n                   \n                     International HapMap Project \n                   \n                     The Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Fundamentalists are threatening astronomy, and astronomy needs to fight back. But this time it's not religious fundamentalists convinced they already know the basic truths of creation. On the contrary, it is precisely because they lack the Universe's basic truths that these 'fundamentalist physicists' have mounted a crusade. They believe that astronomers can provide the truths they want, and they are willing to lay waste the traditions, glories and culture of astronomy to get them. What's worse, some astronomers don't even appreciate the threat. That, in a nutshell, is the call-to-arms issued by Simon White, director of the Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics in Garching, Germany. In a declaration appearing in this month's  Reports on Progress in Physics , and already nailed to the door of the popular arXiv preprint server ( http://arxiv.org/abs/0704.2291 ), White warns his astronomer colleagues that \u201cby uncritically adopting the values of an alien system, astronomers risk undermining the foundations of their own current success.\u201d His treatise has been causing a stir in astronomy departments and stoking animated debate on various blogs. \n               The baryons at the gate \n             White argues that astronomers are straying from the true beauty of the field \u2014 the study of unusual objects in the sky \u2014 into the realm of mere measurement. Particle physicists, a glamorous and well financed bunch, are inveigling astronomers into quantifying fundamental constants to satisfy the equations of cosmology and high-energy physics. White is particularly damning of plans for a mission to study dark energy, a mysterious force that seems to be pushing the Universe apart. Such a project, he says, could suck hundreds of millions of dollars from astronomy in order to measure a single ratio. \u201cA significant number of astronomers were being browbeaten,\u201d White told  Nature  in an interview. \u201cI wanted to say, 'Hey, there are different ways of thinking about the physical world that are just as interesting as figuring out how particles and forces interact with each other'.\u201d White's paper has quickly found a following among some of his colleagues. \u201cI think it's great,\u201d says Paul Schechter, an astronomer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The paper stirred a lively debate at a recent journal club in his department, he says, and many sided with White. \u201cMy first reaction was that there's a lot of truth to this,\u201d agrees Charles Steidel, an astrophysicist at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena. \u201cThere's a sort of 'my problem is more fundamental than yours' mentality.\u201d In Europe, support for White's article appears to be even stronger than it is in the United States. The stable, apolitical funding structure in many European countries means that Europeans worry less about the latest fad, says Georg Feulner, an astrophysicist at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany. But the United States is so powerful that many Europeans are worried about being dragged along for the ride, says Carlos Frenk, an astrophysicist at Durham University in England. \u201cThe US is not Kazakhstan,\u201d he says. \u201cIt is a driving force in astronomy.\u201d Other astronomers, however, believe that White is both overstating physicists' roles in the field and overlooking their contributions. \u201cIn the US, dark energy has done more than anything else to re-energize interest in astronomy,\u201d says Matt Mountain, director of the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, Maryland. \u201cI think Simon is just completely wrong.\u201d There's no physicist cabal working against astronomers, adds Roger Blandford, who directs the Kavli Institute for Particle Astrophysics and Cosmology at Stanford University, California. \u201cI don't see particle physics as some sort of dark force out there pursuing dark projects on dark subjects,\u201d he says. No one denies that fundamental physicists have become increasingly involved in astronomy in recent years. The growing entanglement is in part due to the convergence of the two disciplines' theorists on various questions; another factor may be the difficulty that physicists have had in moving beyond their 'standard model' using the traditional tools of their trade \u2014 accelerators. \n               Number crunching \n             Physicists have been prominent as designers and builders in projects such as the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP), which mapped temperature variations of the microwave background, and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, which catalogued the galaxies across great swathes of the heavens. The latest project at this junction of astronomy and physics is the one that White portrays as the step too far. America's Joint Dark Energy Mission (JDEM, joint between NASA and the Department of Energy) is currently a competition between three different designs for a space telescope that will survey thousands of distant supernovae. But it will do so not out of fascination with the grandeur of exploding suns. Its purpose is simply to gather data on their distances and velocities as a means to improving estimates of dark energy's 'equation of state', a ratio that is a critical parameter in cosmological calculations. \n               A diet of wormholes \n             Astronomers have traditionally built telescopes and satellites that allow them to study a panoply of objects and that enable individuals to pursue their own ideas. In contrast, the new mission would look more like a particle-physics experiment: a large team of researchers would be working exclusively to confirm an already known theory. Such an approach could ostracize the more traditional astrophysicist. Steidel agrees: confirming theory is only part of what astrophysicists do. \u201cOne of the things that make astrophysics interesting to people is that one is almost always surprised,\u201d he says. \u201cI think it's that discovery aspect of things that may suffer if resources are directed to answer 'big questions.'\u201d Schechter adds that dark energy, although fundamentally interesting, is a murky concept that doesn't have much effect on stars and galaxies \u2014 the things most astronomers like to study. \u201cWe already know as much about dark energy as we need to know,\u201d he says. Mountain, however, counters with his view that the questions surrounding dark energy are among the most important in the field, and are bringing welcome publicity to astronomy. Furthermore, he says, the missions under consideration for JDEM are a fraction of the cost of the more general-purpose large telescopes being advanced by astronomers. And many of the missions would collect data useful to people across the discipline. Ultimately, Mountain says, White's anxiety is more nostalgia for the good-old days of astronomy than concern for its future. \u201cThere's a kind of romantic sense that a lone person with a telescope or a piece of paper should still be able to make breakthroughs in the field.\u201d But that's not the way it works in the modern era, he warns. \u201cThe contribution of the individual is being lost because some of these problems are getting extraordinarily hard to tackle. The only question is: are we actually losing great science? Or are we just losing the sense that science is as much fun as it once was?\u201d White stands firm in his belief that the old approach needs to be preserved. \u201cYou need to keep the subject vibrant so that it attracts the best young people,\u201d he says. \u201cOtherwise the traditional way we do astronomy will cease to function.\u201d \n                     Decadal surveys: Wishing for the stars \n                   \n                     US astronomy: Is the next big thing too big? \n                   \n                     Cosmology gets real \n                   \n                     Direct evidence found for dark energy \n                   \n                     White's paper \n                   \n                     Discussion on the Cosmic Variance blog \n                   \n                     The Joint Dark Energy Mission \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), like its subject matter, can be unpredictable. In the last part of its mammoth fourth assessment report on climate change it has produced a surprisingly optimistic analysis of the possibility of mitigating climate change. Stemming the rising tide of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere need not cost the Earth, say the IPCC experts, and the range of options for geting the climate under control is growing all the time. The new report is likely to feed into discussions about climate plans at the G8 summit in Heiligendamm, Germany, next month, and into the United Nations climate-change conference in Bali, Indonesia, in December. Delegates at both these key meetings will try to tackle the long-discussed but little-resolved issue of how to regulate carbon emissions once the Kyoto Protocol on climate change runs out in 2012. \u201cI hope to see the launch of negotiations on a post-2012 climate-change regime in Indonesia,\u201d says Ivo de Boer, head of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change \u2014 the organization that oversees the Kyoto Protocol. \n               Economical cuts \n             The latest report cites evidence that if carbon dioxide emissions were given a cost of US$50 per tonne, economic forces could drive global emissions in 2030 20% to 50% lower than they would otherwise have been. Policies that aim to limit human effects to the equivalent of a doubling in the carbon dioxide level compared with that at the start of the industrial revolution would cost about 3% of the world's GDP by 2030. By 2050, that amount would rise to 4% or 5%. Although these are vast amounts of money, they would lower the growth of the world's economy by no more than 0.12% a year. If the policies lead to further technological change the total costs might be even lower, although upfront costs might be higher. These conclusions, unveiled on 4 May in Bangkok, Thailand, represent the work of the hundreds of scientists, economists, engineers and government representatives who make up the panel's Working Group III. The report of Working Group I, in February, spelled out the scope of the problem in terms of the natural science of climate change. Working Group II's report, released in April, gave a bleak prognosis of the effects that climate change would have \u2014 and in some cases is already having \u2014 on the livelihoods of people around the world, mostly in developing countries. Now, the third chapter gives governments a flexible blueprint for how to turn things around, with an emphasis on energy technologies (see ' 2030 vision '). With the energy sector accounting for two-thirds of emissions, and world demand set to rise by 60% by 2030, \u201ca sound, far-reaching solution is urgently needed\u201d, stresses de Boer. \n               Urgent approach \n             Although not everyone is as rapturous about the report as IPCC chair Rajendra Pachauri, who hailed it as \u201cstunning in its brilliance and razor-sharp in its relevance\u201d, the document has drawn reasonably good reviews. \u201cIt's a very serious look at the kind of actions that will be required across the board,\u201d says Robert Socolow, co-director of the Carbon Mitigation Initiative at Princeton University, New Jersey. Socolow welcomes a new urgency in the way that the panel presents its findings: \u201cThe 2001 report was much more an academic exercise, a very relaxed frame of mind. This one focuses on 2030 a lot, while that date is not even to be found in the 2001 report.\u201d Michael Grubb, one of the report's lead authors, says that the changes in attitude during the report's preparation have been striking. \u201cI cannot imagine that governments would have agreed this report even as little as two years ago,\u201d Grubb says. \u201cIt no longer feels that countries are on different planets, politically.\u201d If everyone is on the same planet, though, the week's events showed that they are not yet all in the same place. China's delegation was reluctant to include details of more radical, and therefore expensive, schemes to stabilize greenhouse-gas concentrations. It argued that disclosing these plans would make it vulnerable to demands for severe emissions restrictions in the upcoming negotiations for a successor to the Kyoto Protocol. In the end, however, European delegates successfully pushed for the report to include details of how to restrict greenhouse-gas concentrations to significantly less than twice pre-industrial levels. That would mean that all the gases mankind is emitting would need to be kept to the equivalent of 535 parts per million of carbon dioxide (the current carbon dioxide equivalent concentration by these gases is about 430 p.p.m.). Stabilization below 535 p.p.m. is thought to provide a fair chance of limiting warming to no more than 2 \u00b0C, the commonly cited threshold for dangerous climate change. \n               Risky premiums \n             Many of those who worked on the report think that allocating 3% of GDP towards this goal represents good value. \u201cIt's a low premium to pay to reduce the risk of major climate change,\u201d said Bill Hare, climate policy director for Greenpeace International in the Netherlands, after the Bangkok meeting. But this view is not universally accepted. \u201cA 3% reduction in GDP would cause a global recession,\u201d claimed James Connaughton, chairman of the White House Council on Environmental Quality. Some governments may be happier to pursue one of the cheaper options set out by the IPCC report, in which greenhouse-gas concentrations are stabilized at higher levels. Levelling them off at 535\u2013590 parts per million would cost between 0.2% and 2.5% of GDP by 2030, whereas allowing them to stabilize above that \u2014 at more than twice the pre-industrial level \u2014 might cost nothing at all. It might even deliver an economic benefit of up to 0.6% of GDP as a result of improved efficiency measures. The guidance that these estimates provide for future negotiations is thus unclear. The report points out that the economic costs that it describes may depend on significant changes in policy. Those changes may be opposed by various vested interests, as well as by the desires of consumers \u2014 who are also, in many countries, voters. Some mitigation strategies would harm the economies of some countries disproportionately \u2014 notably those, such as Russia, that export fossil fuels. Although the report praises the Kyoto Protocol for creating institutions and providing a basis for future efforts, it notes that the protocol's impact will be limited (although it also says that its cost now looks to be less than previously expected). \n               Political trade-offs \n             The key message is that \u201cChoices about the scale and timing of mitigation involve balancing the economic costs of more rapid emissions reductions now against the corresponding medium-term and long-term risks of delay\u201d. That balancing act is essentially political, and is beyond the IPCC's remit. The latest report stresses, though, that a widening range of tools and technologies are available and have been shown to help. Grubb, who is also chief economist at the Carbon Trust, an emissions consultancy in London, UK, says that the report offers \u201ca clearer than expected endorsement of carbon pricing\u201d while setting out a range of credible strategies, including some with an emphasis on technology development that has in the past been seen as the opposite of mandatory carbon controls. \u201cThe nature of the problem means it is not going to be solved with one instrument \u2014 one needs a portfolio,\u201d he says. \u201cIt's about what governments are willing to do in terms of a mixture of options.\u201d See Editorial,  \n                     page 115 \n                   . \n                     Tackling greenhouse gases looks to be affordable \n                   \n                     Climate talks seek to rein in greenhouse gases \n                   \n                     Climate takes aim \n                   \n                     Special Report: From words to action \n                   \n                     Climate change 2007: What we don't know about climate change \n                   \n                     Climate change in focus \n                   \n                     Business news \n                   \n                     Earth and environment news \n                   \n                     Policy news \n                   \n                     Nature newsblog: Earth System Science Partnership \n                   \n                     Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

A set of contrails behind close-flying jets? Orderly raking in a muddy zen garden? A phalanx of harvesters on a giant prairie? No: this is an image of shrimp trawlers (see inset) off the coast of China. The long plumes of sediment churned up by their nets \u2014 'mudtrails' \u2014 are a highly visible sign of the disturbance to sea-bottom ecosystems that they leave in their wake. Conservation ecologist Kyle Van Houtan of Duke University in North Carolina, and fisheries expert Dan Pauly of the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, have identified many such mudtrails in satellite images available through Google Earth. From the Gulf of Mexico to Malaysia, remote-sensing imagery captures details ranging from the number of trawl nets dragged behind a boat to the white dots of seabirds flocking nearby to feast off the unwanted bycatch that is dumped overboard. This particular image was taken by the QuickBird satellite on 20 February 2003, off the coast of Jiangsu province near the mouth of the Yangtze River; ten trawlers cover each square kilometre of ocean. Van Houtan and Pauly are now working with Quickbird, Landsat and other satellite data to quantify exactly how much sediment is churned up by these boats to try to get a handle on the toll taken by fishing. Repeated trawling, they say, can permanently modify the seabed and alter the ecosystem for creatures living in the upper metres of the ocean. \u201cImagining is one thing, but imaging is something else,\u201d says Van Houtan. \u201cWhen we see an image, it really crystallizes the impacts and an attitude towards the sea.\u201d \n                     Patagonian anchovy fishery could threaten penguins \n                   \n                     Dolphin feared extinct in polluted Yangtze \n                   \n                     Sayonara, sushi... \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

What's 3% of a bird? The last seven centimetres of a swan's wingspan? The right foot of an ostrich? Or the annual death toll attributable to an average wind turbine? In the context of last week's report 1  by the US National Academy of Sciences (NAS) on the environmental impacts of wind-energy projects, it's the third definition that counts. It takes 30-odd turbines to reach a kill-rate of one bird a year. The scientists who wrote the report naturally attached lots of caveats to this figure, which they gleaned from 14 studies they felt were of good quality. They acknowledged that rates can differ widely from site to site, and that although, as Hamlet said, there is a special providence in the fall of a sparrow, such a fall might not be quite as special, or worth avoiding, as the death of a bald eagle. In the final analysis, though, whichever way you slice it, or them, America's birds seem to die in turbine blades at a rate no higher than 40,000 a year. Deaths due to domestic cats, on the other hand, are put at \u201chundreds of millions\u201d. It is possible, the panel noted, that the turbines are rather worse for bats; recent studies have turned up more of their carcasses than expected. But the numbers are still small. \n               The shadow of the waxwing slain \n             It is unlikely, though, that the study will allay the worries of bird-lovers who look on wind farms with loathing. For carbon-free power sources, wind turbines have an oddly bad reputation among conservationists: bird safety, like landscape aesthetics, is a common cause for complaint. And the wind farms do not have a completely clean bill of health. As the NAS report pointed out, much of the data available is too narrow and site specific. \u201cMy personal opinion is that the evidence base is very poor,\u201d agrees Andrew Pullin, head of the Birmingham, UK-based Centre for Evidence-Based Conservation. The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB), a British charity with a large membership and quite a lot of muscle, points to the fact that while its members oppose large offshore developments, evidence on British wind farms is limited to studies of small installations onshore. It has also taken a vociferous stance against a vast 234-turbine wind farm planned for the Isle of Lewis in the Scottish Hebrides. In Spain, the world's number three wind-power producer after the United States and Germany, published studies also suggest that the number of birds killed is low. But Spanish environmentalists feel the figures aren't telling the full story. Alvaro Cami\u00f1a, an environmental consultant who monitors bird fatalities at 70 of the country's 140 wind-power farms, says that in the case of a widely accepted study published in 2004 (ref.  2 ), the field work was completed a decade earlier when turbines were much smaller. Cami\u00f1a, who is paid by the regional governments of Rioja, Valencia and Andalucia, recently submitted a report on his research to the Ministry of Environment in Madrid. It is due to be released soon. Of particular importance, he says, are the number of raptors killed \u2014 for example, 866 griffon vultures ( Gyps fulvus ) since 2000. \u201cIt's important to know the mortality of large birds because they have a lower number of offspring. Even a small number of deaths can affect a population.\u201d Raptors have long been a  cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre  in the United States as well. The wind farms in California's Altamont pass have been cutting down golden eagles ( Aquila chrysaetos ) since they were opened in the 1980s. But Rick Koebbe, president of PowerWorks, a California firm that owns turbines in Altamont, argues that this should be put into context. \u201cI heard that over 1,000 birds a year run into the Washington Monument. Should we tear that down? We're out here trying to do a job to save the Earth. We even save birds, since they are twice as vulnerable to pollution as humans.\u201d Unsurprisingly enough, Koebe is against any further regulation of his industry: \u201cIf you give the Fish and Wildlife Service control over the wind-power industry,\u201d he says moodily, \u201cthere will be no more wind power.\u201d \n                     Fridges could save power for a rainy day \n                   \n                     More than just hot air? \n                   \n                     Urban wind power: Breezing into town \n                   \n                     National Academy report \n                   \n                     Brief version \n                   \n                     Pullin's study.

Translational research \u2014 research aimed at getting promising ideas out of the lab and into the clinic \u2014 is a hot topic in biomedical circles, not least because it is a favourite theme of Elias Zerhouni, director of the US National Institutes of Health (NIH). But if it is hot, it's also hard. That, at least, is the experience of the NIH's Immune Tolerance Network (ITN), a consortium of researchers trying to apply some basic immunology to making patients better. The ITN was originally set up in 1999 with a budget of $165 million; on 2 May the NIH renewed its contract with $220 million for the next seven years. But the field is still trying to overcome substantial roadblocks, ranging from problems in setting up clinical trials to significant scientific difficulties. Immune tolerance is the process by which the body avoids launching immune attacks against its own tissues, and the ITN's idea is to harness it to curb the destructive immune reactions that underlie conditions ranging from organ transplant rejection to type I diabetes. Not surprisingly, drug companies have shown little interest in an idea that aims at eliminating patients' long-term need for pharmaceuticals such as immunosuppressants or, indeed, insulin. Although Europe and Canada have smaller consortia devoted to the same end, the ITN, which is also funded in part by the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation, is the largest effort to take tolerance into the clinic. The approach has had some successes. In one notable trial, which was already under way when the ITN began to fund it, a team led by immunologist Megan Sykes at the Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston carried out simultaneous transplants of bone marrow and kidneys from the same donor to six cancer patients with kidney failure, who in any case needed bone marrow. The idea was that the bone marrow would become integrated into the recipient's immune system and make it see the transplanted kidney as its own tissue rather than as an interloper. Three of those patients now survive with no immunosuppressive drugs, and no patient lost a kidney (Y. Fudaba  et al .  Am. J. Transplant.   6,  2121\u20132133; 2006). \u201cThis is the first time anyone has intentionally tried to induce tolerance in transplant patients, and it worked,\u201d Sykes says. A follow-up clinical trial didn't pan out, however. Sykes could not recruit enough patients and so the ITN ended its support last year. She is now part of a team that the ITN is funding to test the same approach with the more numerous kidney-transplant patients who don't have cancer. A follow-up to a successful ITN-funded trial of an allergy treatment was also cancelled after almost a year of planning. \u201cOur original trial was one of two ITN-sponsored studies that got published in the  New England Journal of Medicine ,\u201d says Peter Creticos of Johns Hopkins University (P. S. Creticos  et al .  N. Engl. J. Med.   355,  1445\u20131455; 2006). \u201cWe helped them win that renewal, and then they pulled the plug.\u201d ITN director Jeffrey Bluestone, of the University of California, San Francisco, admits that the network has had to make some hard decisions. He says the trial that Creticos was involved in was cancelled because it didn't recruit enough patients. \u201cI truly regret that we weren't able to pull it off,\u201d Bluestone says. But of equal concern to Bluestone are the scientific difficulties the ITN has encountered. Many treatments that worked like a charm in mice haven't worked out in further tests. He thinks the future of tolerance will not rely on the use of single drugs, which will complicate future trials even further. The ITN completed just seven of its 23 planned trials during its first contract, and cancelled three. A further eight trials are now in the works. Yet Bluestone says, \u201cI wake up every morning with this dream that we'll bring some of these therapies to fruition.\u201d It's a noble dream, and slightly closer to reality than it was seven years ago. \n                     Immunology: The virtue of tolerance \n                   \n                     Immune tolerance network \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

'Save the microbes, save the planet' implored the organic cotton T-shirts on sale at New York's American Museum of Natural History (AMNH) last week. For just $15, the buyer's chest could highlight the plight of microscopic bacteria, viruses, fungi and archaea. But the message that came from the two-day Small Matters meeting held at the museum at the end of April ran counter to the T-shirt slogan: many participants questioned whether there is any need to focus on conserving microbes  per se  compared with conserving the habitats they populate and support. \u201cI'm not worried about the demise of bacteria \u2014 but I would be about the demise of habitats,\u201d says Bess Ward, who studies bacteria and the nitrogen cycle at Princeton University in New Jersey. This is probably just as well, because trying to conserve bacteria in the same way that we conserve 'charismatic megafauna' such as pandas and rhinos is hardly workable. And it is hard to make a case for conserving individual species when a vast number of microbes remain to be discovered \u2014 and especially given that in the case of bacteria there is no clear definition of a species anyway. Fortunately, because microbes are so abundant, genetically diverse and quick to adapt, there is little concern that particular species will become extinct. And the microbe conservation agenda does not necessarily support an idea of the more, the merrier. In one study presented at the meeting, Forest Rohwer of San Diego State University, California, and his team surveyed the microbes living on coral reefs of the Pacific Line Islands using 'metagenomics', or mass sequencing of microbes' genetic material. Off Kingman Reef \u2014 which is almost untouched by man \u2014 they found 10% fewer microbes than off Christmas Island, which supports several thousand people and is overfished. Rohwer says fishing allows algae normally kept in check by grazing fish to proliferate, releasing nutrients that support the proliferation of unwanted microbes. These suck up so much oxygen that they suffocate the coral. Obviously, this work does have implications for conservation; but these support the need to preserve reefs as a whole, not their microbes. Meeting organizer Susan Perkins of the AMNH says that the meeting's main aim was to improve dialogue between the various interested groups and to garner more widespread public awareness of the importance of microbes and their environments. But this could be a challenge for entities most commonly associated with germs and disease, as epidemiologist Durland Fish of Yale University in Connecticut pointed out: \u201cI probably won't wear my save-the-microbes T-shirt to the infectious-disease clinic.\u201d \n                     Microbes reveal extent of biodiversity \n                   \n                     Microbiology: Batteries not includedCircuits of slime \n                   \n                     Complex ecosystems arrived early \n                   \n                     It came from beneath the sea \n                   \n                     Biologists get ball rolling to aid neglected invertebrates \n                   \n                     AMNH Center for Biodiversity and Conservation \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

A major centre dedicated to protein research is to be built in Denmark thanks to the largest ever donation to Danish research. The Novo Nordisk Foundation, which owns various healthcare and biotechnology companies, this week announced that it would provide 600 million kroner (US$110 million) to fund the project at the University of Copenhagen. A core component of the new centre will be a high-throughput facility to express and purify proteins, determine their structure and investigate their properties. The centre will focus on human disease, and will seek to formulate proteins for preclinical tests if they look promising as therapeutics. The university will keep the project's intellectual property, says vice-dean Birgitte Nauntofte. Just as the study of genes scaled up into genomics in the 1990s, so in recent years protein researchers have been upgrading to proteomics. It is a substantial challenge: genes can code for more than one protein, and the products described in genes can be modified after being translated into protein. This means that although the human genome contains some 25,000 protein-encoding genes, a given person's various cells might use up to a million different proteins to do different things at different times in the course of a life. To crank up the complexity further, the proteins work in coordinated teams, requiring their relevant members to be in the right place at the right time if they are to generate the right response. The Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Protein Research will have five principal investigators, two of whom have already been appointed. One is Matthias Mann, a director at the Max Planck Institute of Biochemistry in Martinsried near Munich. Mann is a pioneer of protein mass spectrometry, a key proteomics technology. This technique, which smashes proteins into tiny fragments before reconstructing them by computer for identification and further study, benefits from the sort of large-scale computing power and bioinformatics capability a large centre can provide. Mann will not quit his current position but will oversee independent groups working on biological mechanisms such as signal transduction and on stem-cell biology, particularly in relation to diseases such as cancer.

At the new centre he will focus on integrating what is known about creatures' physical characteristics with proteomic and genomic information in order to understand how different protein complexes may relate to disease. \u201cWe'll have access to Scandinavian biobanks and electronic patient records renowned for their high quality,\u201d says Brunak, \u201cand we'll find more by text mining scientific publication databases.\u201d Mann and Brunack already collaborate in the Interaction Proteome Project, which is funded by the European Commission. \u201cWe've merged our skills before \u2014 for example we've created what we call a 'temporal interactome' in one cellular compartment, the human nucleolus,\u201d comments Brunack, referring to studies of patterns in protein interaction studied over time as well as in space. Building work for the centre will start immediately and it will open in 2008 with a hundred or so staff; some research projects will begin in other premises before this. \n                     Protein purification: Proteomics at Harvard \n                   \n                     Danish biotech centre faces axe \n                   \n                     Betting on tomorrow's chips \n                   \n                     And now for the proteome. . . \n                   \n                     Workshop prepares ground for human proteome project \n                   \n                     Proteomics web focus \n                   \n                     www.hupo.org \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Astronomers may make a major step forward in studying planets around other stars as early as next week \u2014 but the odds are strongly against them. Last week's announcement by St\u00e9phane Udry and his colleagues at the Geneva Observatory that they had found a planet in the 'habitable zone' of the red dwarf Gliese 581 caused a great deal of excitement (S. Udry  et al .  Astron. Astrophys. ; in the press). Its low mass (about five times that of Earth) and its position in the habitable zone, where temperatures are compatible with water being present as a liquid, mean that Gliese 581 c, as the planet is called, could be more Earth-like than anything else yet seen beyond the Solar System. However, finding out whether Gliese 581 c is a larger version of Earth or a smaller version of Neptune \u2014 a much less homely prospect \u2014 means measuring its density. The only way this can be done is by observing the planet cross the face of Gliese 581 and thus working out its radius. Unfortunately, such a transit will be visible from our Solar System only if we happen to be sitting in the plane of the planet's orbit. The chances of that being the case are a daunting 50 to 1 against. Nevertheless, any odds are worth taking when it's the only game in town. On 26 April, just three days after the planet's existence was revealed, Dimitar Sasselov of Harvard University began using the small Canadian space telescope MOST (Microvariability and Oscillations of Stars) to observe Gliese 581. Sasselov predicts that, if the geometry is right, his team should see the star dim on 7 May as the planet passes in front of it. \u201cIf Gliese 581 c transits then the doors are open\u201d says David Charbonneau, another Harvard exoplanet hunter. A transit would not only supply data about density, it would open up the possibility of follow-on observations that might reveal clues to the contents of the planet's atmosphere. A definitive failure to see a transit, on the other hand, would close off almost all lines of future observation with current technologies. An exception is listening out for evidence of artificial radio transmissions. The SETI Institute of Mountain View, California, kept an ear out for signals from Gliese 581 in 1995 and 1997. \u201cWe didn't find any signal,\u201d says Seth Shostak, a SETI Institute astronomer. But the institute's next project \u2014 the Allen telescope \u2014 will nevertheless make looking at the Gliese 581 system a priority. Without transits, the wild card of SETI is the only way forward on this particular planet. But Charbonneau is still uplifted by the discovery. He draws the inference from Gliese 581 c that there are more such low-mass planets around dwarf stars, and indeed Udry says he already has candidates for which he needs just a bit more data. It's not unreasonable to hope that within a few years enough data will have been found to make it likely that at least one will be observable in transit. \u201cOne day we'll be lucky,\u201d Sasselov agrees. \u201cAnd hopefully,\u201d he adds, \u201cit'll be next week.\u201d \n                     The most Earth-like planet yet \n                   \n                     Tales of the expected \n                   \n                     Direct view of a dark and distant world \n                   \n                     Special Report: Alien Earth \n                   \n                     Found: one Earth-like planet \n                   \n                     www.nature.com/nature/links/030130/030130-4.html \n                   \n                     MOST \n                   \n                     Transitsearch \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Goa Sometimes it's nice to catch up with your old neighbourhood, even if you have been gone for some time. Indian researchers are taking this desire to extremes with a campaign for a new Antarctic base in Princess Elizabeth Land \u2014 a part of the continent that, 120 million years ago, was contiguous with India's eastern coast. But the idea has been opposed by other countries and environmental groups. Last year, India's proposal for such a base was turned down at an Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting (ATCM) in Edinburgh. Now the proposal has been resubmitted to this year's ATCM, which started in New Delhi on 30 April. \u201cThis time we have made a strong scientific case for locating the base in Larsemann Hills,\u201d says Rasik Ravindra, director of the National Centre for Antarctic and Ocean Research (NCAOR) in Goa, India. But the Antarctic and Southern Ocean Coalition (ASOC), a pressure group based in Washington DC that opposes the Indian base, continues to voice doubts. \u201cThere have been concerns about the integration of India's plans with the plan for an ASMA (Antarctica Specially Managed Area) by Australia, China, Romania and Russia,\u201d says James Barnes, ASOC's Executive Director. Ravindra says that India favours the Larsemann Hills being designated as an ASMA, and would accept the special controls on environmental damage that such a classification would entail. A 75-page environmental evaluation report prepared by NCAOR seeks to allay fears that the Indian station would harm the Antarctic environment. The effect, if any, would be only \u201cminor or transitory\u201d, the report concludes. India would be willing to quit the base in 25 years, removing all signs of its existence, says Ravindra. Some Indian researchers think that other countries are trying to exclude them. \u201cIt is like entering an unreserved compartment in a train to find the seats are taken,\u201d says Ravindra. They think they were in first and so others must keep out.\u201d Prem Chand Pandey, former director of NCAOR, suspects that the powers  in situ  have an economic motive: \u201cThe area is very rich in hydrocarbons and those who are already in that area do not want others to come there.\u201d Although Antarctic resources cannot be exploited under the terms of the Antarctic treaty, that could change in the future. One scientist notes that during Indian survey work in the area, helicopters from nearby Australian, Russian and Chinese bases were watching from above. These countries supported their opposition to the Indian base with the claim that the area had already suffered \u201chuman impacts.\u201d In a conciliatory move, Australia offered Indian researchers facilities at its station as an alternative to a new base. But India declined the offer because it \u201cwould not have been practical\u201d and because Indians preferred to have their own base, Rajan says. Having permission refused for a permanent base will not stop India's research. \u201cNobody can stop us from going and doing research in the site we have chosen,\u201d says Maruthadu Sudhakar, a senior scientist at NCAOR who led a survey team to Larsemann Hills two years ago. But a new base would make the logisitics easier. It would be closer to current work sites and it would be well sited for studies of the geomagnetic field \u2014 as the magnetic field lines studied at the Larsemann Hills would be those already under investigation at magnetic observatories in Hungary and Denmark. The new base could also be a good ground station for the Indian ocean-observing satellite due to be launched in 2008. But the main reason for selecting the site was to investigate how India broke away from Antarctica. Indian scientists hope that the Larsemann Hills will reveal vestiges of the Indian Mahanadi River, which flowed there about 130 million years ago when the continent was part of Gondwanaland. \u201cThe correlation between the two distant locations with respect to lithology, structure, tectonics and other geological constraints would help in fine-tuning the Gondwana fit,\u201d says Rajan. \n                     Muse: Did Hitler have a base in the Antarctic? \n                   \n                     Green research base to be built in Antarctic \n                   \n                     British design \n                   \n                     www.nature.com/nature/journal/v431/n7010/full/431734a.html \n                   \n                     Indian government draft environmental impact plan for proposed base \n                   \n                     Antarctic and Southern Ocean Coalition \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

According to the myth \u2014 and a classic movie \u2014 Jason and his shipmates on the  Argo  suffered more than their fair share of reverses before bringing home the Golden Fleece. The international team of oceanographers working on the ambitious ARGO programme can surely sympathize. Instrumentation flaws have been discovered that undercut the programme's most striking finding to date. The problems have reinforced calls for caution when interpreting 'real-time' environmental data. ARGO is an array of floats drifting freely around the oceans, 2,800-strong so far and still growing. Each float shuttles back and forth between the surface and the ocean depths measuring temperature and salinity, then sending data home via satellite when it is at the surface. In 2006, data from the array led a team of scientists to the surprising conclusion that the world's oceans had cooled during 2003\u201305 \u2014 exceptionally warm years in terms of global surface temperature. The team published its findings in  Geophysical Research Letters 1 . Such apparent cooling was seized on by people keen to highlight the uncertainties in forecasts of global warming 2 . That cooling has now been shown to be an artefact. In some of the buoys \u2014 they are manufactured in separate batches \u2014 a software glitch caused the temperature and salinity data to be associated with the wrong depths. When the problem data are excluded from the analysis, the cooling trend drops below the level of statistical significance. Novel observation technologies can often be error-prone. In 1997, for example, the discovery of a software problem involving NASA's TOPEX/Poseidon satellite forced a number of groups to lower previously published estimates of global sea-level rise 3 . And until three years ago, calibration problems with data retrieved from different satellites led to an apparently striking discrepancy between temperature trends at Earth's surface and in the atmosphere 4 . The ARGO problem is a reminder that rigid quality control is vital in such cases, says Keith Alverson, director of ARGO's parent agency, the Global Ocean Observing System at the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization in Paris. The ideal is to be able to compare a new analysis with an independent data stream, he adds. The flaw occurred in a batch of floats fabricated at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Massachusetts. It was detected when the temperature profiles generated by ARGO were compared with historical data from the regions where the cooling seemed to be most pronounced. The authors of the original report, led by John Lyman of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in Seattle, Washington, submitted a correction to  Geophysical Research Letters  on 9 April; this had not been published when  Nature  went to press. Apart from the spurious ARGO data, they report a newly discovered bias in temperature profiles from expandable bathythermographs (XBTs) that were also used for the analysis. Inexpensive XBTs have been a major data source for many oceanographic studies. The two problems concealed each other, says Josh Willis, an oceanographer at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, and a co-author of the report: \u201cWhen I first became aware of the problem I was really horrified.\u201d The ARGO Steering Team says that additional information sources should allow one-third of the biased profiles to be corrected exactly, and the remainder approximately. Until then, it is \u201cnot prudent\u201d to use data from the ARGO array in combination with XBTs, the authors recommend in their correction. Other studies done using the data will need to be re-examined in this light. Yet oceanographers remain excited about ARGO's chances of delivering true gold, saying it is the best thing to happen to the field in decades. \u201cFactor it in and move on,\u201d says Gavin Schmidt, a climate modeller at the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York. But he adds that scientists do need to be more aware of things that can go wrong with new observation systems \u2014 particularly if anomalous results turn up. So has the ocean warmed after all? Yes, but not by as much as had been thought before the flaw in the XBTs was found, says Viktor Gouretski, an oceanographer at the Alfred Wegener Institute of Polar and Marine Research in Bremerhaven, Germany. Gouretski has reanalysed historical data, correcting for the bias in the XBTs 5 . According to this work, the top 3,000 metres of the oceans warmed by some 0.03 \u00b0C between 1957 and 1996 \u2014 around one-third less than when the bias was not taken into account. The effect of the more recent bias in the ARGO data has yet to be worked out, however. \u201cIt's always a work in progress,\u201d says Schmidt. \n                     Decades needed to tell whether ocean currents are slowing \n                   \n                     Oceans cool off in hottest years \n                   \n                     Global warming anomaly may succumb to microwave study \n                   \n                     In focus climate change \n                   \n                     ARGO programme \n                   \n                     Global Ocean Observing System \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

A team of plant scientists has cast doubt on one of the most startling research results the field has seen in recent years \u2014 the finding that green plants emit methane. Tom Dueck of Plant Research International in Wageningen, the Netherlands, and his colleagues say that they can find no evidence that plants produce the potent greenhouse gas. Depending on how the comparison is made, methane's greenhouse effect is between 25 and 70 times as great as that of carbon dioxide. Until last year, methane was thought to be produced almost exclusively by microbes either in natural settings, such as swamps, or artificial ones, such as landfills, and in the guts of domesticated cattle. The claim by Frank Keppler of the Max Planck Institute for Nuclear Physics in Heidelberg, Germany and his colleagues that plants also emit methane, published in  Nature  last year ( 439 , 187\u2013191; 2006), threatened to overturn this microbes-only view of the global methane cycle. According to Keppler's team, plants might account for up to 40% of the 580 million tonnes of the gas that are emitted every year. The claim was immediately controversial, not least because Keppler's team could not come up with a metabolic mechanism for their lab-based observations. One reason that the matter has not already been settled is that the amount of methane produced by each plant is low relative to the ambient methane concentration. To tackle this problem, Dueck and his team grew plants in an atmosphere of 'heavy' carbon dioxide enriched in the isotope carbon-13 to give any methane produced a recognizable isotopic signature. But their studies detected no significant methane emissions ( New Phytol.  doi:10.1111/j.1469-8137.2007.02103.x; 2007). Dueck acknowledges the difficulty of attempting to prove a negative. \u201cThe discussion is definitely not ended here,\u201d he says. \u201cWe are very curious to see how this is going to go. But if you are going to look for a mechanism [for methane emission], first you have to be able to measure it.\u201d Both groups have criticized the other's choice of experimental method. Dueck says that Keppler's group kept plants in sealed plastic containers instead of flow chambers, and exposed them to sources of stress such as bright sunlight and high temperature, which could have produced methane as an artefact. Keppler retorts that the use of  13 C is an artificial piece of chemical trickery with unknown effects on plant metabolism, and also argues that methane production can vary by up to three orders of magnitude between species. Nevertheless, without a mechanism, Keppler's claim remains open to attack. \u201cWe are aware that while some scientific groups are having difficulties in repeating our work, several others have been able to do so and their results agree with our findings,\u201d Keppler says. These confirmatory results have yet to be published. Meanwhile, another plant scientist, David Beerling of the University of Sheffield, UK, says that he has not seen any methane using a method that is similar to Dueck's, but without relying on  13 C. His research has not yet been published, but Beerling thinks that if it joins Dueck's in the peer-reviewed literature, \u201cthe two together could kill off the theory\u201d. The problem of how to explain puzzlingly high methane levels found above certain forests remains. But in light of the new results, atmospheric scientist Ed Dlugokencky of the Earth System Research Laboratory in Boulder, Colorado, thinks that the most likely explanation is \u201canother, perhaps anaerobic source that we haven't identified yet\u201d. But even if the theory can be verified, it is likely to have little bearing on regulations of man-made greenhouse-gas emissions, which are known to be just over half of the global total, Dlugokencky says. \u201cTotal emissions are known pretty well from the top down,\u201d he says. \u201cIf methane emissions are coming from forests then that probably just means less from wetlands.\u201d \n                     Methane quashes green credentials of hydropower \n                   \n                     Methane emissions on the rise \n                   \n                     The methane mystery \n                   \n                     Methane finding baffles scientists \n                   \n                     Climate change in focus \n                   \n                     Earth and environment news \n                   \n                     Ecology and evolution news \n                   \n                     Plant Research International \n                   \n                     Max Planck Institute for Nuclear Physics \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

The discovery of a virus that may have killed three transplant recipients in Australia could mark a dramatic acceleration in the speed at which new pathogens can be identified. But it raises concerns that the ease with which such suspects can now be found could lead to researchers overlooking the need to firmly establish them as the cause of the disease in question. Fingering the wrong microbe could lead to inappropriate treatment or divert attention away from the real cause. The three patients received organs from a single donor in Melbourne in December 2006. By January all three were dead. Ian Lipkin of Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health in New York, who specializes in identifying new pathogens, heard about the case and collaborated with the Australian researchers who first took it on. After looking for thousands of telltale signs of known pathogens without success, Lipkin, who sits on the advisory board of 454 Life Sciences in Branford, Connecticut, decided to use the company's technology to sequence genes from samples that had been filtered to enrich their non-human DNA component. Roughly one month and 144,000 fragments of sequence later, a homemade algorithm in Lipkin's lab had pulled out 14 gene fragments that looked viral. Preliminary, unpublished analyses suggest they come from a new member of the family Arenaviridae. Although this sort of sequencing has been used to identify viruses in the past, the 454 technology cuts down on time and effort, says Anthony Fauci, director of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, which funded part of Lipkin's work. Lipkin estimates that the technique could be used to process samples in a matter of days. But simply finding a virus is not enough, cautions microbiologist David Wang of Washington University in St Louis. Establishing that the virus actually caused the deaths is also critical, and is a lot harder. At present, the virus has been found in tissue from all three patients, and not in tissue from 60 controls. The virus's closest relative seems to be the lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, which is believed to have killed organ-transplant patients in the past. But the team does not know whether the virus was also present in the donor. Lipkin says donor tissue samples have not been supplied to him by his Australian collaborators. The guilt-by-association approach to pathogens can be misleading, warns microbiologist David Relman of Stanford University. Viruses do not necessarily behave in the same way as their closest known relatives. And the very fact that these new techniques work with raw sequence, rather than entities that could be grown and studied in the lab, makes follow-up experiments more challenging. \u201cIt's not hard to find somebody you can implicate,\u201d says Relman, in police-procedural mode. \u201cWhat's really hard is to nail the conviction.\u201d \n                     Sequencers step up to the speed challenge \n                   \n                     Powerful new database pins down emerging infections \n                   \n                     Omics Gateway \n                   \n                     Nature Medicine  blog \n                   \n                     CDC Arenavirus \n                   \n                     454 \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Nicholas Negroponte's much hyped 'One Laptop Per Child' (OLPC) scheme inspires or infuriates according to taste. The idea of revolutionizing education by distributing millions of '$100 laptops' to children in the world's poorest countries can be seen as Soviet-style social engineering or as visionary California dreaming, mass empowerment or pointless frivolity. However you see it, though, the project is facing real problems \u2014 and competition. Negroponte, who founded the MIT Media Lab in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and heads the non-profit OLPC Foundation, admitted last week that in the near term the laptops will cost not US$100, but at least $175. And although he is still confident that the first 3 million machines will be shipped by the end of 2007, an earlier estimate for the same timeframe was 10 million. Meanwhile, as PC markets in industrialized nations become saturated, Intel, Microsoft, and other computer companies are turning their sights on developing countries, hoping to find the next billion computer users. \u201cWe are at the most critical stage of OLPC's life,\u201d Negroponte told a meeting with industry analysts in Cambridge, Massachusetts, on 26 April. \u201cA year and a half ago, we were selling a dream, but it's easy to sell dreams if you're passionate and can share that passion with other people. But that was dreams, and now we have got to launch.\u201d \n               Unique approach \n             To launch, Negroponte needs money. OLPC has an unorthodox business model: it sells only to governments and demands minimum orders of 250,000 machines at a time \u2014 down from its original demand of one million units. The idea is to achieve scale instantaneously, and to pass distribution and marketing costs on to the purchaser. How much those extra costs will push the bill up is not clear. The OLPC project is based on the idea that just providing computers can make a huge difference, as children will spontaneously use them to make up for what they lack in books and other equipment and experiences. But many education researchers dispute this theory. And the more that classroom structure and teacher training is needed to maximize the computers' benefit, the more the programme will end up costing governments. So far no countries have actually paid for their computers, let alone revamped their education efforts to prepare. Libya has come closest, signing a memorandum of understanding to buy 1.2 million laptops. Rwanda and Uruguay have said that they are committed to the project, and several other countries have expressed interest. But some are firmly ruling themselves out. \u201cWe cannot visualize a situation for decades when we can go beyond the pilot stage,\u201d Sudeep Banerjee, India's education secretary, said last year. \u201cWe need classrooms and teachers more urgently than fancy tools.\u201d In March, in an investment report on OLPC and related companies \u2014 such as Quanta, the Taiwanese firm contracted to build the foundation's $100 laptop \u2014 investment analysts at Merrill Lynch concluded that \u201cdespite the hype, we urge investors not to chase stocks related to OLPC\u201d. Low-end laptops can already be made at a cost of $400, the report pointed out, and OLPC's lower costs come from using less-powerful components and eliminating distribution and after-sales service, both of which impose burdens on the end user. The report also points out that OLPC is not the only show in town. Intel is rolling out its $400 Classmate PC to schools in Brazil and Mexico this year, and has pilot schemes in 25 other countries. Over the next 5 years it is investing $1 billion to promote access to information technology in developing countries. Microsoft, loathe to see the next billion computer users running the open-source Linux operating system that the OLPC computers use, last week announced that it would offer developing countries a software package that includes XP and Office for $3 for every new school PC bought. No one denies that the rugged OLPC laptop contains some serious technological innovation. It runs on just 2 watts of electricity \u2014 around a twentieth of a typical laptop's needs \u2014 and can be charged off-grid in various ways. Its display can be read in bright sunlight, and nearby laptops automatically create a wireless network between themselves with which, among other things, they can share an Internet connection. Ashok Jhunjhunwala, a former director of the Indian Institute of Technology in Chennai, and one of the India's top experts in information technology sees the OLPC machine as \u201ca great technological effort\u201d. But \u201cproper support is a must. Nothing works without support, management and maintenance\u201d. \n               Change in focus \n             Poor countries have other public spending priorities, Jhunjhunwala argues, and initiatives such as OLPC should start where they can have a real effect \u2014 among the market of emerging middle classes and schools that can afford the computers for themselves. The OLPC will otherwise be irrelevant to developing countries; in the poorest strata of society \u201cthis toy will just be sold or stolen\u201d. Jhunjhunwala himself is the brains behind the netPC and netTV computers built by Novatium, a Chennai-based company, which embraces the idea that PCs no longer need large, expensive hard drives and stacks of memory, but can instead act as gateways to computing power elsewhere on the Internet. Users are expected to access free web-based word-processing and spreadsheet software and storage, as offered by web services such as Google Office, or to take out a subscription for Microsoft Office and other paying software served over the web by Novartium's own central servers. Whatever the future for the OLPC project, the fact that the next billion computer users will be in developing countries looks set to drive a new phase in computing innovation \u2014 one that could have repercussions in developed markets too. Last week, for the first time, Negroponte said that he was considering selling the computers to US children via their state governments, an idea he had previously rejected. The educational information appliance of the future might turn out to be a mobile telephone, or some sort of hybrid, but no one can rule out Negroponte's vision of one laptop per child coming true worldwide. That does not mean, though, that his specific approach will get much further. \n                     Appropriate technology: Make anything, anywhere \n                   \n                     Science & Africa: A message to the G8 summit \n                   \n                     The e-developing world \n                   \n                     India online \n                   \n                     Switch it off! \n                   \n                     OLPC \n                   \n                     wiki \n                   \n                     Intel Classmate PC \n                   \n                     Microsoft's 'Unlimited Potential' \n                   \n                     Novatium \n                   \n                     OLPC news \u2013 independent blog covering the project \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Italian research is headed for major reform \u2014 yet again. But this time it's for real, insists Luciano Modica, undersecretary of state for research, and the main architect of a reforming law that the Italian parliament is expected to pass by the end of May. \u201cThe difference between this law and other attempts at reform is the element of autonomy,\u201d says Modica. For the first time, every research organization and institute will have full control over its budget, recruitment and how it runs its research. At the same time, the institutes will be accountable to the government for their decisions. Universities were given autonomy in 1990, but without much accountability. Now there will be budgetary consequences for any university or research institute that makes bad decisions. The new law also creates an independent evaluation agency that will assess the quality of the research produced. And it gives the government power to withhold funds from institutes that do badly and to reward good performers with extra money. \u201cNot only money \u2014 also positions,\u201d says Modica, who this week created 1,600 positions for entrance-level professorships over the next three years. These will be distributed to the universities ranked highest in Italy's first research assessment exercise, carried out in 2001\u201303. \u201cThe first ten universities in each field will get a certain number of these professorships, paid for by the government, and the others will get none,\u201d Modica says. The decree also dictates that presidents of research agencies can no longer be simply named by the government, but will be chosen from short lists drawn up by expert committees. Among other things, this change is likely to lead to the ousting of Fabio Pistella, president of Italy's main research agency, the National Research Council. Constitutionally, such changes at the agency must be overseen by a temporary commissioner, not the incumbent president. A new president will then have to be appointed under the changed procedures once the commissioner's job is done. Pistella, who is not highly regarded, is unlikely to be on the post-reform short list. \n                     Italian government eases in radical reforms \n                   \n                     Q&A: Fabio Mussi \n                   \n                     Italians put science chief on the spot \n                   \n                     Saving Italian science \n                   \n                     www.miur.it \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

In some contexts, black suits over black shirts might seem depressingly funereal. But for Rob Reiner, Hollywood writer-director-producer-actor, and Al Gore, the Oscar-winning former US vice-president, the black-on-black look is the sort of chic more or less de rigeur when opening the Tribeca Film Festival. They were there because this year it features a series of shorts about climate change. And above the collars the two men were all about the joy, doing their best to give green activism a new, upbeat sell. Their enthusiasm revolved around Live Earth, a global extravaganza set for 7 July that, Gore says, \u201cis an opportunity for the whole world to come together at the same time in a spirit of joyfulness\u201d. Live Earth is to be a media event in the tradition of 2006's Live 8, which focused attention on debt relief at the time of the G8 summit in Gleneagles, Scotland. It will include seven concerts on seven continents, and fits into Gore's stated plan to move the global culture past a \u201ctipping point, beyond which political and business leaders and all sectors of civil society compete to offer policies and programmes that will sharply reduce emissions\u201d. Naturally, nothing says rock and roll like policies and programmes, and Live Earth has attracted a wide range of talent, although skewed, perhaps, to the tastes of Gore and Reiner's generation. At Tribeca, the band in the spotlight was Spinal Tap, whose life on the road was documented in Reiner's 1984 spoof rockumentary of the same name. The Tap, veterans of Save the Ferret and donors to the High Instep Foundation, are not only reforming for Live Earth but also releasing a new single, 'Warmer than Hell'. A Reiner film of the reunion will be one of 60 short films on climate-change themes released at the time. Six of these shorts were shown at the festival, and ranged from the dressed-up factual \u2014 an explanation of America's energy sources in the style of a rock video \u2014 to the strikingly metaphoric \u2014 a pretty face being spat on by passers by. \u201cAll of these things that we are seeing where people are raising awareness are good,\u201d says Katie Mandes, communication director for the Pew Center on Global Climate Change, a policy shop in the Washington DC area. \u201cYou can't do the advocacy if you don't have heightened awareness, and we still have a long way to go.\u201d And she agrees with Reiner and Gore's cheerful stance. \u201cI think it is important to start talking about solutions, to avoid the notion of hopelessness.\u201d \n                     Could America lead the world on global warming? \n                   \n                     Climate Change 2007: Al's Army \n                   \n                     Cut the climate antics \n                   \n                     Green activists enlist penguins to save the world \n                   \n                     Al Gore: Eco matinee idol? \n                   \n                     Oscars 2005 \n                   \n                     Climate change in focus \n                   \n                     Spinal Tap teaser on MSN \n                   \n                     SOS Live Earth page \n                   \n                     The Alliance for Climate Protection \n                   \n                     Tribeca Film Festival \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Last week, two papers in  Science  reported the discovery of florigen, a long-sought compound with the power to make flowers bloom. But if the celebration of its discovery seems a little muted, it is because many researchers have heard this claim before. And this time, the reports come as an old one is retracted amid charges of data manipulation. The discovery of florigen was heralded in 2005, when another  Science  paper 1  claimed that it was the RNA produced by a gene called  FLOWERING LOCUS T , or  FT . But now the authors of that paper have retracted their findings, and in its stead come two papers that say florigen is not  FT  RNA, but the protein produced by the  FT  gene. The finding could solve a riddle that has been around since 1865, when German botanist Julius von Sachs observed that illuminating a single leaf on a darkened morning-glory plant was enough to prompt the plant to bloom. That suggested that a signal travelled from the leaf to the site of flower initiation. Some 70 years later, the signal was christened florigen by the Russian plant physiologist Mikhail Chailakhyan. The hunt was on, and physiologists spent decades testing compounds extracted from flowering plants, only to fail to find the compound responsible. Over time, the florigen concept fell out of fashion, giving way to a hypothesis that the flowering signal was not a dedicated compound but rather a complex mix of nutrient and hormonal signals. \u201cFor a long time, florigen was the f-word,\u201d says Joe Colasanti, a plant biologist at the University of Guelph in Ontario, Canada. \u201cYou didn't want to bring it up.\u201d But the recent work shows that researchers were looking in the wrong places over all those years, says Jan Zeevaart, an emeritus plant biologist at Michigan State University in East Lansing. Most people expected florigen to be a small chemical compound. \u201cThey weren't looking for proteins,\u201d he says. Then, in August 2005, two papers reported that although the  FT  gene produces RNA in the leaf, the encoded protein acts in the tip of the shoot, where flowers form. The simplest explanation was that a product of  FT  \u2014 either the RNA or the protein \u2014 somehow travelled from the leaf to the shoot tip. Within a month, a team led by Ove Nilsson of the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences in Ume\u00e5 announced that this product was  FT  RNA. Although that didn't rule out the possibility that the FT protein also travelled from leaf to shoot, it suggested that  FT  RNA was at least a component of florigen. The discovery was significant enough to make  Science 's list of 'Breakthroughs of the Year'. But now Nilsson has retracted the paper and has accused Tao Huang, the paper's first author, of manipulating data. Nilsson says Huang selectively excluded some data points and statistically overweighted others. Huang, who left Nilsson's lab for a faculty position at Xiamen University in China after the paper was published, maintains that excluding the data was justifiable. He says he circulated the data \u2014 with excluded data points marked \u2014 to his lab colleagues before publication, but no one objected to the exclusion. Huang has not agreed to the retraction, calling it premature. Nilsson's retraction was published at the same time that  Science  released the two new papers 2 , 3 . Both papers \u2014 one on the thale cress  Arabidopsis  and the other on rice \u2014 report that although  FT  gene expression is restricted to the leaves, the protein can travel to the tip of the shoot. And both papers fail to find evidence for movement of  FT  RNA. The timing of the papers, coupled with what several researchers have described as an unusually short, 40-day review, has led some to speculate that the papers were pushed to publication more quickly to coincide with the retraction. But Katrina Kelner,  Science 's deputy editor for life sciences, says the review period was not abbreviated. \u201cIt was sensible to have them come out at the same time for maximum clarity of the literature,\u201d she says. \u201cWe coordinated them, but the review process of those two papers was in no way abnormal.\u201d The new work comes with its own share of caveats. Both groups rely on commonly used but indirect measures of protein movement, and some researchers have pointed out that key controls are lacking. Overall, however, many experts say the new papers are convincing. \u201cNone of these is really the killer experiment,\u201d says Detlef Weigel of the Max Planck Institute for Developmental Biology in T\u00fcbingen, Germany. \u201cBut I would say the overwhelming evidence is that the protein moves.\u201d Zeevaart goes even further. \u201cThe problem is solved,\u201d he says. But with a history as chequered as florigen's, not everyone is ready to close the book. \u201cIt's always good to be cautious,\u201d says Colasanti, \u201cespecially in this field.\u201d \n                     Flower arranging made easy \n                   \n                     Blooming gene found \n                   \n                     A rosy glow \n                   \n                     Building a flower \n                   \n                     Ove Nilsson's webpage \n                   \n                     Detlef Weigel's webpage \n                   \n                     Joseph Colasanti's webpage \n                   \n                     Jan Zeevaart's webpage \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

The closure of five of the 26 regional libraries of the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) last year sparked international protest. Congressional hearings were held, and a government investigation was launched. In February this year, the president of the American Library Association told Congress that the closures have restricted access to information in at least 31 states. The EPA is not alone \u2014 last year, the Department of Energy closed its headquarters library in Washington DC. And now, NASA is considering downsizing its network of libraries \u2014 including the one at its leading science-research centre, the Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. Tight budgets could bring even more whittling of libraries in the United States. \u201cWhen budgets are threatened, agencies tend to say let's put the library on the chopping block,\u201d says Tara Olivero, assistant director at the American Library Association in Washington DC. Libraries are already working to reinvent themselves in a digital world in which online access is fast reducing the need for rows of books and stacks of journals. But a full transition to electronic resources might not save money as agencies hope. Officials at the EPA, whose libraries provide a wide range of information about environmental protection and management, initially cited a proposed budget cut of US$2 million \u2014 an 80% drop from the previous year \u2014 as the main reason for downsizing its library network. Yet critics point out that internal EPA studies have suggested that having a librarian saves between $3 and $7 in professional staff time for every dollar invested. Since the closures, EPA librarians have struggled to maintain the same level of cost effectiveness. On requesting a publication from another library, they are sometimes told that the item is not available and that no one knows where it is, says Bernadine Abbott Hoduski, a former EPA librarian. The agency is working to convert all EPA documents into an electronic format, and its spokeswoman Jessica Emond says that the project \u201chas not incurred additional cost\u201d. But critics argue that for agencies considering downsizing their physical libraries, going electronic will almost certainly require more, not less, money. For a start, not everything can be digitized, and dedicated staff are needed to assess what material should be put in digital form. Content must also be produced using technologies that will be usable decades in the future. \u201cIn many ways you need a higher level of expertise to produce and maintain an electronic service than a physical one,\u201d says Anne Kinney, a NASA scientist and chair of a group that recently assessed how the print materials at the Goddard library could be reduced. The demand for library services other than shelf space has shown no sign of tapering off and, if anything, has increased in recent years. To ensure that electronic resources don't result in costs simply being transferred to individual researchers, those services need sustained funding, librarians say. At the Naval Research Laboratory library in Washington DC, chief librarian James King says that he has seen a dramatic falling-off in the number of people walking through the door. But \u201cspace is not synonymous with service\u201d, he says. Use of the naval library's online databases has doubled in the past five years. \u201cThere is a risk of people seeing libraries only as warehouses,\u201d King says. He and others argue that in a time of information overload, librarians have an ever-more-valuable role in designing web interfaces that facilitate browsing and focused searches. They also create and operate databases specific to the needs of the research communities they serve, and have intricate knowledge of electronic resources across agency- and university-library networks. And in a world where new journals are continually coming online, librarians say they are best placed to negotiate with publishers to obtain the cheapest site-licence contracts and to monitor the changing needs of a specific community of users. For her part, Kinney envisions a different future for the science library. Instead of silent halls with towering racks of books, smaller meeting places could double up as information centres, where researchers can plug in their laptops, hold discussions, and talk to librarians about how to navigate the myriad resources online. NASA has not yet made any decisions about closing any libraries, but the issue is likely to remain on the table: \u201cThe NASA budget isn't getting any bigger,\u201d notes Robin Dixon, chief librarian of Goddard. The challenge will be to cut back on physical resources without cutting back on service. \n                     Science in the web age: The real death of print \n                   \n                     NASA Goddard library \n                   \n                     EPA \n                   \n                     Medical Library Association reports \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

German scientists have condemned a parliamentary decision to stop primate experiments at the University of Bremen, calling it unacceptable political interference with the freedom to conduct research. Animal-rights activists in the state of Bremen have been campaigning for years against the macaque experiments of Andreas Kreiter, a neuroscientist at the university's brain research centre. Now, in the run-up to regional elections on 13 May, the activists have finally won cross-party political support.  Bremen's parliament last month unanimously asked the state government not to reapprove Kreiter's experiments from the end of 2008, when his licence becomes due for renewal. Meanwhile, a commission of scientists and representatives of animal-protection groups is to re-evaluate the scientific value of Kreiter's research, and assess whether the experiments could be replaced by non-invasive methods. Both issues have been addressed before by granting agencies and by the local authorities and ethics committees, Kreiter says. Neither the state parliament nor the state government can order the university to close down the centre. But Kreiter fears that political pressure will force the local authorities not to approve further experiments. \u201cThis decision was motivated by the election campaign,\u201d says Matthias Kleiner, president of the DFG, Germany's main funding agency for university research. \u201cIt's an attempt to interfere with the constitutionally guaranteed freedom to research. We hope that the approval authorities in charge will decide solely on the basis of applicable law.\u201d Primate researchers in Germany are used to violent protests. Kreiter's research, on cognitive processes such as attention, involves placing electrodes in monkeys' brains. He and his family were put under police protection in 1997 after they received threatening letters. Attacks have since ceased, but in March animal campaigners submitted to Bremen's parliament 15,000 signatures from people who opposed the experiments. Considering the ethical pros and cons of animal experiments is always crucial, says Alexander Thiele, a brain researcher at Newcastle University, UK. But he says that the level of political interference with Kreiter's project, which has been approved both legally and ethically, is \u201cscandalous\u201d. Thiele had been offered a professorship at the Humboldt University in Berlin, which he rejected when local authorities last week denied approval for his planned experiments on visual attention in macaques. He says that such blatant political intervention at a local level is less common in Britain because experiments there are approved by the Home Office. The state science ministry in Bremen, which oversees the university, is also unhappy with the parliamentary decision. \u201cThis is very disturbing,\u201d says Holger Bienhold, a ministry official in charge of the natural sciences. \u201cIt's hardly conceivable to stop a professor from doing legally and ethically approved research.\u201d Kreiter has won around \u20ac3 million (US$4 million) in grant money from various sources, including the DFG, the federal science ministry, and the European Union. Kreiter is determined to continue his research in Bremen, and has started to prepare for possible lengthy lawsuits. The commission is due to release its review of his work is due in June. \u201cIt seems weird to me that the same people who have fought me to the finish will now judge my work,\u201d he says. \u201cThey will most likely misuse every bit of information they can get.\u201d But the experiments are cruel to animals, says Wolfgang Apel, president of the German Animal Welfare Association and organizer of the petition against Kreiter's work. The committee, he says, will suggest how, and not just whether, the experiments will be phased out. Alternatives to some types of invasive experiments on primates do exist. For example, functional magnetic resonance imaging can effectively measure activity in large groups of brain cells. But to measure the activity of individual neurons, which is crucial to study cognitive processes such as visual attention, electrodes must be directly inserted into a monkey's brain. \n                     Animal Research: Primates in the frame \n                   \n                     An open debate \n                   \n                     News Feature: Monkey business \n                   \n                     Animal rights activists turn the screw \n                   \n                     Animal research special \n                   \n                     6th World Congress on alternatives & animal use in the life sciences \n                   \n                     University of Bremen Brain Research Institute \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

China this week postponed its scheduled release of a national plan to deal with climate change. But observers say the move is not so much a delay in dealing with the issue as an indication that the Chinese government is taking climate change more seriously \u2014 and that this is as much to protect its own needs as it is a response to international pressures. China's booming economy \u2014 it grew by 11% in the first quarter of 2007 \u2014 has long worried those trying to control the rise of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. And estimates made public last week back up that concern: they suggest that China will exceed the United States as the biggest emitter of greenhouse gases as early as the end of this year \u2014 not 2010, as energy experts had previously forecast. With a new coal power plant being built there roughly every four days, China's emissions are undoubtedly soaring. The question is by how much. A report released by Greenpeace on 24 April says that under a \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d scenario, they will triple by 2050. But compared with the United States, China's per capita emissions are still quite low: in 2003, China emitted 3.2 tonnes of carbon dioxide per person, whereas the United States emitted 20 tonnes per person. The Chinese government has consistently argued that it cannot put caps on greenhouse-gas emissions while the country is still developing. But the United States has refused to join any international regulatory framework on climate change, such as the Kyoto Protocol, unless limits for developing countries are also included. China's climate-change plan, which had been set for release on 24 April, has now been put off until next month. But urgent action seems essential. A national assessment released in January paints a grim picture for the country's future. It notes that over the past few years there has been a 12% drop in water supply to northern China. Without significant measures to combat global warming, the report predicts that the productivity of China's three staple crops \u2014 rice, wheat and maize (corn) \u2014 will fall 5\u201310% by 2030, and will be close to 40% by the second half of the century. Such specific predictions are spurring the government to act after many years of inaction, says Yang Ailun, a Beijing-based environmental expert with Greenpeace. \u201cBefore, China always relied on the same arguments about the historical responsibility of developed countries,\u201d she says. \u201cThat makes sense. But now China is greatly concerned about its vulnerability and social stability.\u201d China is already committed to reining in increases in energy use, and such efforts are closely linked to the country's ability to limit emissions. It plans to close down 50 gigawatts' worth of its least-efficient power plants by 2010. That would mean shutting down roughly 1,000 small plants. \u201cIf the small, old plants are there, there is no way to decrease energy consumption,\u201d says Yang Fuqiang, a Beijing-based energy expert with the Energy Foundation. These efficiency initiatives are part of the country's Five Year Plan for National Economic Development for 2006\u20132010, which calls for a reduction in the amount of energy spent to produce a unit of gross domestic product by 20% within five years. \u201cThe targets are tough, but they are possible,\u201d says the Energy Foundation's Yang. Energy-efficiency targets have, however, become a sore point. The first year of this plan fell far short, achieving only a 1.23% drop according to government figures. And so far, signs for 2007 are not good, says James Brock, an independent energy adviser in Beijing. Brock has advised both the UK and US chambers of commerce on Chinese energy issues. He says he has witnessed the tension in meetings at which officials from the National Development and Reform Commission, which recommended the 20% target, suggested to the powerful State Council that the target can't be met and should be recalculated. \u201cThey got read the riot act,\u201d says Brock. Part of the problem is the difficulty in measuring emissions precisely. These are generally estimated on the basis of the types and amounts of energy consumed. But remote-sensing studies of nitrogen dioxide concentrations \u2014 which are also released during the burning of fossil fuels \u2014 suggest that estimates based on energy consumption could be too low (H. Akimoto  et al .  Atmos. Environ.   40,  7663\u20137667; 2006, and A. Richter  et al .  Nature   437 , 129\u2013132; 2005). Hajime Akimoto of the Frontier Research Center for Global Change in Yokohama, Japan, says the satellite data show a 50% increase in nitrogen dioxide concentrations between 1996 and 2002. This compares with a 15% increase calculated by the International Energy Agency based on energy consumption over that period. Indeed, experts say the uncertainty is so great that it is difficult to know how China's carbon emissions compare with those of the United States. Gregg Marland, an environmental scientist at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee, says that crucial figures needed to estimate China's energy consumption are often missing. Changes in remaining stocks of coal go unreported, for example, or, for a single year, a figure will inexplicably drop to zero. Marland says that, as a result, any estimates of China's emissions could be off by 15\u201320%. He adds that the considerable amount of carbon dioxide produced in making cement, if included in the figures, could also tip the balance. China produces 45% of the world's cement. \u201cChina could be exceeding the United States right now,\u201d Marland says. Further details of China's carbon dioxide emissions may have to wait until next year, when NASA plans to launch the Orbiting Carbon Observatory. The satellite is designed to provide high-resolution data on worldwide carbon dioxide emissions.

When US government regulators hired the firm Sciences International to help review a potentially dangerous chemical, they almost certainly didn't intend to ignite a political firestorm. But the company's links to the chemical industry have enraged environmentalists and forced the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) to pull the contract. Last week, in the face of growing pressure from both Congress and the public, the agency announced that it would re-review the 20 chemicals that the company had been involved in studying. Scientists, environmental groups and even private contractors say that the situation highlights a weakness in federal environmental and health regulation. Private companies hired to do risk assessments are rarely required to disclose conflicts of interest. And often, the companies have relationships with the industries that the regulators are charged with overseeing. \u201cIt is definitely a problem,\u201d says Sandra Schubert, director of government affairs for the Environmental Working Group, the watchdog based in Washington DC that criticized the work. The review involves bisphenol A, a chemical commonly found in plastics, including baby bottles and microwave containers. The chemical disrupts the endocrine system in mice, and some researchers think that it might cause similar effects in humans. Both Japanese and European regulators say that more research is needed to determine whether the chemical is harmful. In July 2005, the NIEHS hired Sciences International of Alexandria, Virginia, as part of a panel to summarize hundreds of studies on bisphenol A. The firm had done the same sort of work many times before for the agency. But this time, the Environmental Working Group caught wind of the study and learned that Sciences International had two clients \u2014 Dow Chemical and BASF \u2014 that produce bisphenol A. In late February, the advocacy group wrote to the agency demanding a review of Sciences International's role in the study. After several weeks of mounting pressure, the NIEHS announced that it was scrapping its contract and reviewing the work already done on bisphenol A and the other chemicals. Several scientists involved in the review told  Nature  they think Sciences International had behaved ethically and impartially. \u201cI really don't think that they were trying to influence the process,\u201d says Simon Hayward, a cancer biologist at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee. But others contend that the company was deliberately stacking the review literature in favour of industry. \u201cAll those reports are suspect,\u201d says Frederick vom Saal, an endocrinologist at the University of Missouri at Columbia, who was not involved in the review. \u201cThe panel should be shut down.\u201d Independent scientists on the bisphenol-A panel were required to sign conflict-of-interest forms, but Sciences International was not. The company did volunteer to report any potential conflicts of interest, according to Sciences International's president Herman Gibb. But he says that there was no conflict because the staff working on bisphenol A were not working for private clients. \u201cWe didn't do anything wrong,\u201d he says. \u201cThis is unfair with a capital 'U'.\u201d Sciences International's website says that about half of its business comes from private companies and half from the government, and it is hardly alone in that regard. A brief investigation by  Nature  turned up at least half a dozen other firms that work simultaneously for federal regulators and industry \u2014 sometimes in the same area. For instance, in 2005, Syracuse Research Corporation, a non-profit company based in New York, was hired by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to help review perchlorates, which are reactive salts that can damage the thyroid. At the same time, the company's defence division was partnered with Lockheed Martin, a firm that has been sued for leaking perchlorates. Syracuse has an internal panel to review potential conflicts of interest, says spokeswoman Lisa Mondello. In this case, she says, the company collaborated with a division of Lockheed that doesn't handle perchlorates. \u201cIt's really not connected,\u201d she says. \u201cThe larger the company, the more it becomes an issue,\u201d says James Lamb, a toxicologist with the Weinberg Group, a consultancy firm based in Washington DC that does regulatory work for private industry. Lamb says that some companies, like Sciences International, try to segregate industrial and government work to limit conflicts, but few if any regulators have rules about disclosing or managing such issues. \u201cConflicts of interest have never really been completely ignored,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I really don't know what the legal process has been.\u201d In fact, the relationships are a legal grey area that has troubled regulators in the past. In 2004, the US Environmental Protection Agency and the NIEHS came under fire for accepting US$2 million from the American Chemistry Council \u2014 an industry lobby group \u2014 to conduct a children's health study (see  Nature   432 , 6; doi:10.1038/432006a 2004 ). The agencies eventually withdrew from the arrangement, and a subsequent investigation by the US Government Accountability Office found that stronger guidelines were needed. Both agencies say that they have since rewritten their guidelines about directly taking funds from industry.

Projects that explore the world's biodiversity might seem like natural allies. But last week a workshop was held in North Carolina expressly to mend fences between two such initiatives that have different approaches. Both projects use genetics to catalogue the relationships between organisms. The Assembling the Tree of Life project, funded by the US National Science Foundation, explores the evolutionary relationships between different classes of organisms. And the Consortium for the Barcode of Life initiative, funded largely by private foundations, uses short DNA signatures to discriminate between species. Some systematists, such as those in the Tree of Life project, think that the upstart barcoding approach ignores crucial information that helps to define organisms, such as their habitats and their relationships with other species. As a result, the two groups tend to regard each other with more scepticism than friendliness. The workshop, which was held on 19\u201320 April and attended by about 40 scientists from both communities, was intended \u201cto build bridges\u201d, says co-organizer Joel Cracraft, an ornithologist at the American Museum of Natural History in New York. For some, the occasion was a milestone. \u201cThis really is a signal that a lot of the hostility about barcoding has died down and disappeared,\u201d says David Schindel, executive secretary of the Barcode of Life project. But others remain more reserved. \u201cI still have some scepticism about barcoding, depending on what its goals are,\u201d says Cracraft. Proponents of barcoding have encountered particularly tough resistance to the idea that the technology will help the world to catalogue its fast-disappearing biodiversity, by quickly identifying new species based on DNA differences from known species. Systematists scoff at this idea and say that because species have varying levels of genetic diversity, setting a uniform cut-off for how much diversity distinguishes a new species is tough. But barcoders have now published research showing that their approach can work in some contexts (K. C. R. Kerr  et al .  Molecular Ecology Notes  doi:10.1111/j.1471-8286.2007.01670.x; 2007). And systematists have decided to try to find common focus with barcoders, rather than turning up their nose at the entire enterprise. The meeting's organizers hope that these connections will ultimately lead to collaborations. But for now, they say, just getting the scientists to talk to each other is a good first step. \n                     Butterflies poke holes in DNA barcodes \n                   \n                     Treasure island: pinning down a model ecosystem \n                   \n                     Cowrie study strikes a blow for traditional taxonomy \n                   \n                     www.nescent.org \n                   \n                     atol.sdsc.edu \n                   \n                     www.barcoding.si.edu \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Analysis of two damaged brains, preserved in a museum since the nineteenth century, could force neuroscientists to rethink the area where language resides in the brain. In 1861, the French surgeon and anatomist Paul Broca described two patients who had lost the ability to speak. One patient, Lelong, could produce only five words, and the second, Leborgne, could utter only one sound \u2014 \u201c tan \u201d. After their deaths, Broca examined their brains and noticed that both had damage to a region in the frontal area on the left side. Broca's area, as it became known, is now thought to be the brain's speech-processing centre. Broca kept the patients' brains for posterity, preserving them in alcohol and placing them in a Paris museum. And that's where Nina Dronkers, of the VA Northern California Health Care System in Martinez, and her colleagues picked them up, in order to reinspect the damage using magnetic resonance imaging. Leborgne's brain had been scanned twice before, but not Lelong's. And neither had been compared with modern interpretations of Broca's area. After the team put the two brains through a scanner, they came up with a surprising finding: in both patients, the damaged area was much larger than the region that is now considered to be Broca's area. \u201cWe were noticing that what people were calling Broca's area encompassed large areas of the frontal lobe,\u201d says Dronkers. The scans show that neither of the old brains had damage that affected the whole region now known as Broca's area. But damage also stretched far into other regions beyond this spot. Broca realized this at the time, says Dronkers, and noted that the areas of damage were different in the two patients. But his conception of the area involved in speech processing has become simplified by others over time, the authors argue. They published their findings online earlier this month in the journal  Brain  (N. F. Dronkers, O. Plaisant, M. T. Iba-Zizen and E. A. Cabanis  Brain  doi:10.1093/brain/awm042; 2007). This misplaced focus could lead to problems when diagnosing people with language impairments, says Dronkers. By assuming that only one small area of the brain is responsible for language, clinicians might overlook other regions involved in speech production. In other words, focusing too heavily on Broca's area could be missing the point, Dronkers argues. Others agree. \u201cThere's a tendency for researchers to see activation in somewhere like Broca's area and to say 'oh well, we're tapping into a language area',\u201d says Joseph Devlin, a neuroscientist at the University of Oxford, UK, who images language networks in the brain. Newer imaging techniques may also help researchers to discover what Broca was unable to see. Dronkers and Devlin are both working on the use of alternative imaging techniques to investigate other regions of the brain that may be important in language processing but which are not detected by magnetic resonance imaging, such as the tracts of white matter that connect areas of grey matter. \n                     Chords strike a grammatical note \n                   \n                     www.nature.com/nature/focus/neurobreakthrough/index.html \n                   \n                     Broca's region \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Jacksonville, Florida Soon after the news emerged on 29 March that a magnet test in the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) atom-smasher had failed, two physics bloggers decided to have a bit of fun with the idea. On 1 April they posted blogs announcing news such as 'Three years of delay for LHC start-up'. Visitors found the reports all too easy to swallow, decrying it as a cruel blow. Only then did one blogger add an April Fool's spoiler, with an apology: \u201cSorry to those of you who got hurt by not understanding that in the first place.\u201d If these blog postings were close to the bone for many, it is because the LHC is running hard up against its deadline to switch on later this year. Conspiracy theories were also quick to fly: any postponement at the LHC, near Geneva, Switzerland, means that the Tevatron collider at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory in Illinois has more time to discover the last part of the standard model of particle physics \u2014 the Higgs boson. On 15 April, the race became even more heated. At a meeting of the American Physical Society in Jacksonville, Florida, Tevatron physicists announced refined measurements for the masses of two particles that, taken together, lower the expected mass of the Higgs. The new estimates \u2014 of the mass of the top quark and of the W boson \u2014 put an upper limit on the Higgs mass of 144 GeV. In January, the best estimate was 153 GeV (see  Nature   445 , 239; 2007). The lighter the Higgs, the better the chance the Tevatron has to detect it before it shuts down in 2009. Researchers are more immediately worried about potential LHC delays caused by the failure of the magnet, which was supplied by Fermilab. \u201cThis does add to the burden of everything that has to be done before the machine switches on,\u201d says Pier Oddone, director of Fermilab. \u201cWe are embarrassed we created this additional problem.\u201d At the same time, some LHC researchers admit privately that the mistake might give them some breathing room. The magnet that failed was part of an inner triplet designed to focus the proton beams before they interact. During a pressure test to simulate conditions expected in the collider, the eight-tonne magnet jumped 13 centimetres, rupturing a pipe and causing a loud bang. The problem was quickly identified as a weakness in the supporting structure. \u201cThere was a definite oversight here,\u201d admits Stephen Holmes, head of accelerator physics at Fermilab. The accident was not the first magnet failure: another Fermilab-supplied magnet had a faulty heat exchanger that had to be replaced a few months earlier. The second problem was one too many for Oddone, who has initiated an external review to figure out how the team missed such simple design flaws. Meanwhile, CERN \u2014 the particle-physics laboratory in which the LHC is housed \u2014 and Fermilab are working together to find a fix and to minimize the effect on the LHC schedule. Options include reinforcing the triplet support structure with rods, or building physical buffers so that the magnets cannot move too far. Engineers hope to announce a solution by 25 April, and to test it on another triplet in the tunnel in early June. The time needed to repair the magnets will need to be factored into the overall LHC operation, which was already running five weeks behind schedule before the accident, says project manager Lyndon Evans. There is also pressure to get the repair right the first time around, because there are few spare magnets available. The most likely victim of any slippage is the first engineering run, planned for late 2007. The LHC is being chilled down in sections; it took from January to March 2007 to cool the first eighth of the machine to 1.9 kelvin. The process will become quicker, but cooling the final sectors in just two weeks each \u2014 as Evans says the current schedule demands \u2014 will be challenging, with or without the magnet repairs. \u201cIn my view the magnet problem has been blown out of proportion,\u201d he says. \u201cIt is a very small part of a bigger picture.\u201d Evans adds that he still hasn't given up on the LHC conducting its first run in 2007, but admits that only an extreme optimist would share his view. With delay building on delay, a formal announcement of when the LHC might come online isn't expected until mid-May. And with CERN closing as it usually does for the winter months, no run in 2007 could push the first science run later than planned in 2008. And by that point, the Tevatron will have had another year or more to hunt for the Higgs. \n                     Magnet failure could delay hunt for Higgs \n                   \n                     Behind the hunt for the Higgs boson \n                   \n                     Shrinking Higgs brings optimism to US lab \n                   \n                     Below-par performance hampers Fermilab quest for Higgs boson \n                   \n                     CERN: The show goes on \n                   \n                     LHC latest \n                   \n                     Fermilab Today \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

A public-health expert in the United States is facing a potential jail term or a hefty fine after distributing documents that contain safety data on a blockbuster drug. The material came to light during initial negotiations in an ongoing lawsuit over the drug, and its manufacturer says that the information should have remained confidential. The case, which could result in charges of contempt being levelled against the expert, shines light on the murky debates that go on between lawyers before drug liability cases get to court. Legal experts say that the negotiations often end with crucial data being sealed from public view after lawyers have finished with it, even though they could be relevant to public health. \u201cDefendants essentially pay for the right to keep stuff secret,\u201d says Paul Levy, an attorney with Public Citizen, a consumer-advocacy organization based in Washington DC. \u201cIt is a conflict between public and private interests.\u201d The latest incident centres around David Egilman from Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island, who is a frequent critic of the pharmaceutical industry, and Eli Lilly, a drug firm based in Indianapolis, Indiana. Lilly's best-earning drug is Zyprexa, a treatment for schizophrenia that brings in more than US$4 billion a year. But over the past two years Lilly has paid $1.2 billion to more than 26,000 patients who complained that the drug caused them to develop diabetes and hyperglycaemia. Other lawsuits related to Zyprexa and diabetes are ongoing, including one that Egilman last year agreed to contribute to as an expert witness. Egilman had access to 15 million pages of confidential documents containing clinical-trial data and details of marketing plans that Lilly had released to lawyers during pre-trial negotiations, known as the discovery phase. But because the cases were settled before they reached court, the material was bound by confidentiality agreements. This situation is common and has angered public-health experts and some lawyers. Discovery documents often contain evidence that suggests a drug is not as effective or as safe as its manufacturer claims and the information has sometimes not been released to regulators such as the US Food and Drug Administration. Yet lawyers are under no obligation to ask for the confidentiality order to be removed, even if the material suggests that the public is at risk. In the Zyprexa case, 376 documents emerged after what might be called creative journalism by the  New York Times . According to a 13 February statement from Jack Weinstein, the New York district judge overseeing the case, Egilman discussed the documents with Alex Berenson, a  Times  reporter. To get the material, Berenson gave Egilman the name of an attorney who, the judge said, \u201cwould be a willing ally in an attempt to avoid the court's protective order by finding a case which could be used as a pretence for subpoenaing the protected documents\u201d. The attorney, James Gottstein of Anchorage, Alaska, subpoenaed Egilman for the Zyprexa documents and then forwarded them on to the reporter. The result was a series of front-page stories in which Berenson alleged that Lilly had downplayed the risks that Zyprexa users would develop diabetes. The stories also claimed that Lilly tried to persuade doctors to prescribe the drug for dementia, a condition that it was not licensed for. Lilly spokesman Philip Belt declined to comment on either issue, saying only that the information quoted by Berenson was taken out of context. Although Egilman was subpoenaed to release the documents, he and Gottstein could face jail terms or be required to contribute to Lilly's legal bills if the contempt proceedings proceed and are upheld. The documents, meanwhile, remain available online on a blog about mental-health issues. Generally though, information uncovered during the discovery phase remains secret. In a separate instance, psychiatrist David Healy, of Cardiff University in Wales, says that he received confidential documents for several cases on which he was to act as an expert witness. Lawyers in the cases were acting for individuals who claimed that they or their relatives had had suicidal or homicidal thoughts after taking antidepressants known as selective seratonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). All the documents had to go back to the firms that supplied them, but \u201cthere is a great deal of material that ought to be out there\u201d, says Healy. Documents have also been sealed in other SSRI cases that were settled before trial and in litigation involving prescription painkillers such as oxycontin and neurontin. And in 2004, publication of a study on cancer risk at an IBM factory was delayed after lawyers for the firm argued that the data were covered by a confidentiality order. \u201cConcealment of such evidence corrupts the scientific literature,\u201d says Vera Sharav of the Alliance for Human Research Protection, a patient advocacy group based in New York. (Sharav had also received the documents from Gottstein, but was ordered by Weinstein to return them). Changing the rules governing discovery documents will be difficult. Discovery material often contains trade secrets, such as details of how a drug is made, as well as records for individual patients. Without confidentiality, defendants would be much more reluctant to give up such materials. \u201cThe judge knows that the secrecy is the grease that keeps things moving,\u201d says Gottstein. \u201cHe doesn't want the settlement to get gummed up.\u201d Critics acknowledge that some material needs to be kept under wraps, but that this should not prevent documents from being released if they are in the public interest. Some legal firms, such as Baum Hedlund in Los Angeles, California, devote time to challenging protection orders alongside pursuing their obligations to their clients. Others add that plaintiffs sometimes want the material to be made openly available in the interest of the public, and will ask the lawyers not to sign confidentiality agreements. Documents can also come out if politicians ask for them: Senator Chuck Grassley (Republican, Iowa) wrote to Lilly on 4 April asking to see all the Zyprexa material. But the chances for broader reform seem to be limited. Richard Zitrin, director of the Center for Legal Ethics at the University of San Francisco in California, says that legislation to prevent lawyers from signing confidentiality agreements that go against public safety has failed several times because of pressure from corporate lobby groups, including those representing the pharmaceutical industry. In the meantime, attorneys will continue to have to seal documents that they know should be made public, something many find intensely frustrating. \u201cIt burns you up inside,\u201d says Cindy Hall, a pharmaceutical litigation consultant with Baum Hedlund. \n                     Study of cancer in IBM employees finally published \n                   \n                     Journal grows suspicious of Vioxx data \n                   \n                     Industry money skews drug overviews \n                   \n                     Britain to combat conflicts of interest in drug regulators \n                   \n                     Drug trials: Stacking the deck \n                   \n                     Lilly press statements on Zyprexa \n                   \n                     Judge Weinstein's final ruling \n                   \n                     Jim Gottstein's website \n                   \n                     Chuck Grassley's letter to Lilly \n                   \n                     Zyprexa documents \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Washington DC US senators voted last week, for the second time in nine months, to lift restrictions on federal funding for human embryonic stem-cell research \u2014 even though they expect President George W. Bush to veto the decision again. So why the repeat of last July's political meltdown? In part, senators are positioning themselves for next year's congressional elections and for the one political contest that will bear enormously on future US stem-cell policy: the presidential race of 2008. In that race, stem-cell research \u201cis going to be a very big issue, maybe right up alongside the war\u201d, says Daniel Greenberg, a veteran Washington science commmentator. Jockeying began in the Senate on 11 April, when members voted 63\u201334 in favour of the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act of 2007. The bill allows federal funding for research on stem cells that are derived from embryos left over at fertility clinics and already slated for destruction. It is similar to one passed by the Senate last summer and then vetoed by Bush (see  Nature   442 , 335; 2006). And no sooner had last week's vote been cast than the president issued a statement promising to do the same again. \u201cThis bill crosses a moral line that I and many others find troubling,\u201d he said. \u201cIf it advances all the way through Congress to my desk, I will veto it.\u201d The House of Representatives is expected to vote on the bill in the next few weeks. If it passes the House and is vetoed by Bush, it is unlikely that Congress will muster the two-thirds majority necessary in both houses to override the presidential veto. Three Democrats missed last week's Senate vote; all would almost certainly have voted in favour, bringing the total votes in favour to 66 \u2014 one shy of a two-thirds majority. The margin in the House is larger: a House vote on a similar bill in January failed by 32 votes to reach a veto-proof majority (see  Nature   445 , 134\u2013135; doi:10.1038/445134a 2007 ). So Bush's current policy, which dates from 9 August 2001, looks almost certain to remain in place for now. This limits federal funding to research on stem-cell lines that existed on that date, a number that has dwindled to 21. But whoever assumes the presidency in January 2009 could implement his or her new stem-cell policy with \u201ca wave of a hand\u201d by using an executive order, says Jonathan Moreno, a professor of medical ethics at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. That means that voters on both sides of the issue are closely scrutinizing the positions of the leading presidential contenders. Senator Sam Brownback (Republican, Kansas) spoke out against the bill last week and is the only declared presidential candidate who aggressively opposes stem-cell research. But he is a second-tier contender. Three other, stronger, Republican hopefuls are treading delicately as they try to court moderates without losing votes on the right. Rudolph Giuliani, the Republican former mayor of New York City, has thus far skated around the stem-cell issue, saying that new technology needs to be taken advantage of while life also needs to be respected. Mitt Romney, a Mormon, originally supported stem-cell research as Republican governor of Massachusetts. Then in February 2005, he announced that he opposed the cloning of embryos for research purposes and would support criminal sanctions for those doing so. Senator John McCain (Republican, Arizona) voted in favour of the bill that passed last week. So, too, did two leading Democratic contenders, Hillary Clinton of New York and Barack Obama of Illinois, both of whom were among the bill's many co-sponsors. And former senator John Edwards (Democrat, North Carolina) strongly supports federal funding for the research; after last week's Senate vote, he issued a statement urging Bush not to veto the bill. Amongst all this political manoeuvring, Senate conservatives also bought themselves some political cover. Last week, the Senate passed the Hope Act, which Bush has promised to sign if it is also passed by the House. This allows federal funding for research on stem cells that are derived from embryos that the bill terms \u201cnaturally dead\u201d. The bill passed by a vote of 70 to 28, with Republicans the main supporters. Sponsored by Norm Coleman (Republican, Minnesota), the bill defines \u201cnaturally dead\u201d as \u201chaving naturally and irreversibly lost the capacity for integrated cellular division, growth, and differentiation\u201d. Critics, however, note that there is no scientific standard for determining what is a viable embryo. \n                     Congress and Bush set to clash on stem cells again \n                   \n                     US election: Showdown for Capitol Hill \n                   \n                     A long week in stem-cell politics... \n                   \n                     www.nature.com/news/infocus/stemcells.html \n                   \n                     www.nature.com/nature/focus/stemcells25years/index.html \n                   \n                     www.nature.com/nature/focus/making_stemcells/index.html \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Rhesus macaques can't claim the distinction of being humanity's closest cousins, nor of ever having been popularized by Jane Goodall. But the newly completed analysis of the macaque's genome could prove just as important as that of the chimpanzee's, scientists say. Macaca mulatta  is the third primate genome to be sequenced, following those for humans ( Homo sapiens ) and chimpanzees ( Pan troglodytes ). Adding the macaque to that picture, scientists say, should allow researchers to make better sense of the other two genomes. And because the rhesus macaque is the main monkey model for many diseases, understanding its genome could help to clarify why some diseases develop, and why some treatments work differently in monkeys from in humans. The macaque genome, published on 13 April in  Science , is crucial for unravelling the evolutionary events that led to humanity. Ever since scientists released the chimp genome sequence in 2005 (see  Nature   437 , 69\u201387; 2005), they have been busily trying to dissect how it differs from our own \u2014 looking for clues to explain uniquely human traits. But when a genetic difference is identified between humans and chimps, it is not always possible to tell which form of the DNA is older. Scientists can compare each sequence to those of distantly related animals, such as chickens and mice, but this technique fails when the genetic variant is so new that it is unique to primates. The macaque is therefore an ideal reference point, scientists say, because the evolutionary split between monkeys and apes (such as humans and chimps) occurred 25 million years ago, much earlier than the human\u2013chimp divergence 6 million years ago. \u201cNow that we have a third primate, a large part of the focus is understanding the changes that happened in each primate lineage, and that is very important in understanding evolution,\u201d says George Weinstock of the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, Texas, a leader of the macaque sequencing effort. The project involved researchers from North America, Asia and Europe (Rhesus Macaque Genome Sequencing and Analysis Consortium  Science   316,  222\u2013234; 2007). And the macaques could soon have company. Other primate genome sequences in progress include the gibbon ( Nomascus leucogenys ), orangutan ( Pongo pygmaeus ), gorilla ( Gorilla gorilla ) and marmoset ( Callithrix jacchus ). The new analysis finds that where humans and macaques share genes, the DNA sequences in those genes are 97.5% identical. But the findings also highlight differences between the species' DNA. For instance, the scientists report that the 108 gene families shared between humans, macaques and chimps have evolved differently in the three species, and about 60% of those amplified in the macaque show signs of natural selection. Some of these genes probably explain differences between humans and monkeys \u2014 like our inability to swing through forest treetops and our revulsion to ingesting our own vomit. The differences might also shed light on more medical issues. Macaques are often used as stand-ins for humans in experimental tests of drugs and medical treatments \u2014 especially for infectious diseases, such as HIV. But these monkey tests do not always accurately predict how the treatments behave in the human body. The new analysis finds that macaques have many more copies of genes corresponding to those making up the human HLA system \u2014 a key part of the body's defence against diseases. Finding that the HLA system is genetically different in macaques could be a sign that the monkeys' immune systems don't work like our own. That information, in turn, could help researchers design more accurate preclinical tests in macaques. \u201cA lot of people use macaques as a model for the immune response, so the fact there are these differences is important,\u201d says Evan Eichler of the University of Washington in Seattle, one of the leaders of the analysis portion of the macaque project. And that, scientists say, means that the macaque genome should be analysed in even more detail. The current publication is only a 'draft' sequence \u2014 meaning it is not as complete as, for instance, the human genome. \n               Historical hangovers \n             But already, plenty of material is available to chew on. For instance, the analysis turned up hundreds of cases in which humans and macaques share a gene, but although the macaque version keeps the monkey healthy, the human one causes disease. Understanding the implications of this finding could take some time. But it may cause some scientists to rethink their approach to the nature of disease. Rather than being a recent glitch in our physiology, a disease-causing gene might actually be a holdover from our ancestral history that hasn't kept pace with the way our bodies or lifestyles have evolved, and has now become detrimental. \u201cWe tend to think about disease very simplistically, that everything was fine until a new variant was introduced, and then things went awry,\u201d Weinstock says. \u201cBut actually, it is much more complex than that.\u201d \n                     Chimpanzee joins the genome club \n                   \n                     First monkey genome sequenced \n                   \n                     Draft human genome sequence published \n                   \n                     www.nature.com/nature/focus/chimpgenome/index.html \n                   \n                     www.nature.com/news/specials/chimpgenome/index.html \n                   \n                     White Paper for Complete Sequencing of the Rhesus Macaque ( Macaca mulatta ) Genome \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Humans are generally believed to be more highly 'evolved' than our chimpanzee cousins. But in at least one sense that isn't true, say geneticists who have hunted for the hallmarks of natural selection in our respective genomes \u2014 and found more of them in chimps. The discovery suggests that, since our evolutionary paths diverged 6 million years ago, greater numbers of chimpanzee genes have been shaped by 'positive selection', in which natural selection favours beneficial mutations. Researchers at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, combed through 14,000 matching genes from the human and chimpanzee genomes. As they report in  Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences  this week, 233 chimp genes showed signs of having been shaped by positive selection (M. A. Bakewell, P. Shi and J. Zhang  Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA  doi:10.1073/pnas.0701705104; 2007). The corresponding figure for our own genes was just 154. The result overturns the view that, to promote humans to our current position as the dominant animal on the planet, we must have encountered considerable positive selection, says lead author Jianzhi Zhang. \u201cWe think we're very different from animals, with our large brain size and speech,\u201d he says. The gene discrepancy might be due to the fact that, for much of our histories, chimpanzees had the larger population size. Humans, with a smaller and more fragmented population, may have been shaped by random, erratic changes. It is difficult to put together a coherent picture, says Zhang, because it is hard to know which genes would have been crucial in shaping traits such as our large brain size. \u201cIt is possible that the genetic changes underlying brain size are very few,\u201d he says. A sample of 14,000 genes does not tell the whole story. The team could not compare the entire genome as the chimp sequence has not been completed to the same level of detail as the human one. But for genes with good sequences, they were taken to show signs of positive selection if they had a high proportion of 'non-synonymous mutations' \u2014 DNA changes that alter the protein sequence produced by the gene \u2014 which could be a 'lever' for natural selection. Zhang admits it is difficult to spot genes that have been the subject of more recent positive selection. Such genes could have been responding to selection pressures \u2014 such as changes in climate and food source \u2014 encountered by humans as they began to move out of Africa and across the planet over the past 100,000 years. There also seems to be little pattern to the functions of the selected genes, says Zhang. Among those favoured in chimps are genes for protein metabolism and stress responses, whereas the human genes are involved in processes such as fatty-acid metabolism. Victoria Horner, who works with chimpanzees at Yerkes National Primate Research Center in Atlanta, Georgia, says: \u201cWe assume that chimpanzees have changed less than us, when that's actually not the case.\u201d \n                     First monkey genome sequenced \n                   \n                     Chimpanzee joins the genome club \n                   \n                     Chimp chromosome creates puzzles \n                   \n                     Multiple copies of a mystery gene may make us human \n                   \n                     Jaw-dropping theory of human evolution \n                   \n                     Chimp genome special \n                   \n                     Ecology and evolution news \n                   \n                     Genetics news \n                   \n                     Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences \n                   \n                     Jianzhi Zhang lab \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Gravity Probe B (GP-B) seems like the experiment that never ends. The spacecraft set records for the longest-running development project at NASA \u2014 40 years \u2014 and data analysis is stretching into its second year. The GP-B team may one day announce the most precise measurements yet of a long-sought effect of general relativity. But that didn't happen on 14 April, when project scientists presented an interim report to the American Physical Society meeting in Jacksonville, Florida. Team members promise a final report by December, when money for the $760-million experiment runs out. But it is clear that unexpected systematic errors will make it a real challenge to reach the original mission goals. For the most subtle effect measured, the GP-B team needs to make the experiment's uncertainty 100 times lower. GP-B is a simple concept that in reality proved overwhelming. The experiment, proposed in 1964, required four perfect spinning gyroscopes in Earth orbit to measure how the spinning planet drags the fabric of space-time around with it \u2014 a phenomenon predicted by Einstein's general theory of relativity and called 'frame-dragging'. The mission survived every NASA attempt to cancel it (see  Nature   426 , 380\u2013381; 2003) and was finally launched in April 2004. The main goal was to measure frame-dragging to within 1% accuracy. That would be ten times better than the best measurements so far, which were taken by bouncing laser signals off the Earth-orbiting LAGEOS satellites. GP-B has had one success. At the meeting, the team announced the first experimental measurement of geodetic precession, another small distortion of space-time. The geodetic precession of the Moon around the Earth has previously been verified to an accuracy of about 0.7%. GP-B has now measured the effect on their probe to within 1.5%. The team hopes to reduce this further \u2014 but it is the much smaller frame-dragging effect that everyone cares about. The problems plaguing the analysis are systematic errors: electrostatic effects on the spheres at the core of the gyroscopes cause misalignments and wobbles that vary unexpectedly over time. The data were also recorded in chunks because solar flares required the system to be rebooted. Physicist Clifford Will, who chairs NASA's scientific advisory committee for the project, says such errors are a real headache: \u201cThere's art involved \u2014 it's a slightly nebulous business; that's why they are being careful.\u201d Still, the team remains bullish about the remaining data analysis. \u201cI'm not interested in being disappointed,\u201d says Francis Everitt of Stanford University, the project's principal investigator. Meanwhile, the LAGEOS findings could be further improved before the end of the year by incorporating a new model of Earth's gravitational field, as gathered by the GRACE spacecraft. Erricos Pavlis of the University of Maryland in Baltimore County, who works with the LAGEOS data, says that it would be nice to beat GP-B, but even so he doesn't want to see it fail. \u201cAfter all these millions spent and decades of people's work,\u201d he says, \u201cit's only fair that they get something out of this project.\u201d \n                     Gravity probe falters \n                   \n                     Spinning Earth twists space \n                   \n                     einstein.stanford.edu \n                   \n                     www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/gpb/index.html \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

MiniBooNE aimed to settle controversy raised by the Liquid Scintillator Neutrino Detector (LSND) at Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico, which looked at how one type of neutrino could turn into another, or 'oscillate'. The LSND findings suggested that a fourth kind of neutrino existed \u2014 a sterile neutrino. But many scientists were sceptical of the result. Using a 12-metre sphere filled with 800 tonnes of mineral oil to catch neutrinos, the MiniBooNE team found no evidence, at high neutrino energies, for the sort of oscillation that workers at LSND had reported (A. A.

Team members say they are still working on the data and can't be so sure. At low neutrino energies the detector saw more electron neutrinos in the experiment's beam of muon neutrinos than expected.

Fans of ozone data, rejoice. US science agencies announced on 11 April that they will restore an axed ozone sensor to a satellite that is due to launch in 2009. The sensor was scrapped last June, when the National Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System (NPOESS) was brutally restructured. The system is meant to merge and replace the US military and civilian weather-prediction satellites, but it is over budget and behind schedule. At least three climate sensors were axed at the time. Now, the instrument known as the Ozone Mapping and Profiler Suite Limb will get to fly aboard the initial satellite in the system, according to NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The sensor will measure the distribution of ozone concentrations from the ground to the top of the atmosphere, and can be used to monitor the ozone layer and the slow recovery of the ozone hole. Earth scientists at NASA, along with ozone scientists, pushed hard for the sensor to be reinstated. Pawan Bhartia, senior staff scientist at the Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, who helped to develop the instrument, says that the sensor will be there to collect ozone data when the current satellites Aura and Envisat stop operating, perhaps in the next couple of years. \u201cRight now, the missions we have cost a billion dollars each,\u201d he says. \u201cBut once you understand the science, you can keep on monitoring it on a long-term basis, but not spend so much money on it.\u201d Andrew Carson, an executive for the project at NASA headquarters in Washington DC, says that the change of heart was influenced in part by a January 2007 National Academy of Sciences report that called for stronger Earth-monitoring efforts from space.

Freedom-of-speech groups have expressed concern at the treatment of a prominent Venezuelan physicist who has been fired as head of a government research lab after poking fun at the government over nuclear policy issues. Claudio Mendoza was stripped of his position as head of a computational-physics lab in the Venezuelan Institute of Scientific Research (IVIC) in Caracas because of comments he made in an article written to promote a science-related play. He sarcastically suggested that Venezuelans should not worry about their country's growing alliance with 'rogue' nuclear states such as Iran, because Venezuelan officials do not listen to experts and so would not be able to develop nuclear technology anyway. Although Mendoza is still a researcher in the lab, his dismissal as head after 10 years raises fears that his right to free speech has been infringed, says Juan Carlos Gallardo, chair of the American Physical Society's Committee on International Freedom of Scientists. The committee has written to Venezuelan officials to request details of the case. Although no other scientists there have reported similar harassment, the government has been accused of waging a campaign against freedom of speech in the media, and the fear is that similar repression is now extending to the research community. Gallardo has pledged to monitor the situation and take further action if Mendoza is sacked outright. Mendoza says he has been accused of treason, even though his comments were meant to be witty and he was not writing in an official capacity. His remarks were published on 13 September 2006 in an article to publicize a production of  Copenhagen  by British playwright Michael Frayn. The play dramatizes a discussion between physicists Neils Bohr and Werner Heisenberg about the feasibility of developing nuclear weapons. Addressing fears that Venezuela might seek to join the nuclear club, Mendoza wrote: \u201cHere bridges are built without engineers, diagnoses are made without doctors, oil is refined without petroleum experts, one can teach without being a teacher, you can govern without being a statesman. We will therefore explode nuclear energy while ignoring the physicists.\u201d But it seems that nuclear policy is no joking matter. Although Venezuela has no nuclear programme of its own, it has significant reserves of uranium ore, and in 2005 Venezuela announced that it would join forces with Iran to develop domestic nuclear power. Venezuela is also thought to have endorsed Iran's controversial uranium-enrichment programme, although without a seat on the UN Security Council, it was unable to influence the council's unanimous vote in December 2006 to ban the project. Four days after the article was published, IVIC's board of directors removed Mendoza as lab head, and gave him 30 days to provide evidence of his apparent insinuation that Venezuela might be planning to enrich uranium. Mendoza submitted a dossier of newspaper articles but this was rejected as sufficient proof. When asked to retract his article, he refused. The article was \u201cthe last drop\u201d in a series of altercations in which Mendoza has criticized his paymasters, says IVIC director M\u00e1ximo Garc\u00eda Sucre. In 2003, for example, Mendoza complained that the government was not giving enough financial support to IVIC \u2014 a claim denied by IVIC directors (see  Nature   422 , 257; doi:10.1038/422257a 2003 ). \u201cHe has manifest many times his nonconformity with IVIC decisions,\u201d Garc\u00eda Sucre told  Nature . \u201cIn a certain sense he is an activist. In this situation it is not possible to be head of a lab \u2014 there must be a minimum of affinity with scientific politics.\u201d He adds that such personnel changes are routine, and that Mendoza still has all the rights of any IVIC staff member. Mendoza says that he is unsure whether he will be dismissed entirely. \u201cI don't think I will try to get reinstated as head. I am just basically trying to survive as a researcher,\u201d he says. \u201cI hope he will understand that the measure that has been taken is a mild one,\u201d says Garc\u00eda Sucre, adding that in making fun of government officials, Mendoza has indirectly criticized president Hugo Ch\u00e1vez. Asked whether Mendoza will be fired outright, Garc\u00eda Sucre says: \u201cHe should start to work in his lab instead of being in the newspapers all the time saying he is being victimized.

Michael Hopkin reports. Brussels The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is not known as a bearer of good news. In February, it reported that human activities are almost certainly causing the planet to warm (see  Nature   445 , 578\u2013579; 2007). On 6 April in Brussels, Belgium, it delivered an even more sobering message: that billions of the world's poorest citizens are at risk of hardship and disease as a result of climate change. Attention is now shifting from arguments over whether the world is warming to what should be done about it. And all six-billion-plus on the planet should be concerned, the IPCC's report implies. The people most vulnerable will be those who live at or near sea level, often crowded into cities along the coast. But drought, disease and extreme weather events will also become more frequent around the world, threatening the lives and livelihoods of countless more.\n \u201cNo one will escape the impacts of a warming planet,\u201d says Patricia Romero Lankao, a sociologist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colorado, and an author of the report. What's more, many of the effects of climate change are already evident in physical and biological systems, the report says (see map). Regional climate changes are affecting natural systems on every continent, with the Arctic, sub-Saharan Africa, and Asian mega-deltas among the worst affected. The  Climate Change Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability  report is the second instalment of the IPCC's Fourth Assessment, a summary of the current state of knowledge about climate change. The third assessment was published in 2001. Crucially, this report is the first to link actual data on how natural systems are responding to the amount of warming they have experienced. \u201cFor the first time we are no longer arm-waving with models,\u201d says Martin Parry, co-chair of the IPCC's Working Group II. Authors compiled more than 29,000 data sets, on everything from glaciers to the timing of spring foliage, and compared the trends with the amount of regional warming observed in each area since 1970. In more than 90% of cases, the changes in natural systems were consistent with predictions of how they would behave in a warming world. \u201cRegional changes are happening on a global scale,\u201d says Parry, although more data are needed from the developing world. The report was also the first major attempt to predict what physical changes might take place under a range of future warming scenarios. At high latitudes such as in northern Europe, crop yields are expected to flourish under modest climate warming. But rises of greater than about 2 \u00b0C look set to diminish agricultural productivity the world over (see  'What's new' ). By evaluating which systems are the most likely to be altered by future climate change, the report's authors have tried to predict the knock-on effects for humans. Most at risk are the estimated 100 million people who live within a metre of sea level. Meanwhile, as many as 250 million Africans are predicted to be at risk of water shortages, and drought will also damage agriculture at low latitudes. \u201cWe have 500 million people hungry today,\u201d says Parry. \u201cWe're gonna get a lot more.\u201d In terms of health, vector-borne diseases such as tick-borne encephalitis and dengue fever are expected to increase as insects expand their range. So too will extreme weather events such as the 2003 heatwave that killed thousands of people in Western Europe. The report builds on that of the IPCC's first working group, which announced in February that it had 'very high confidence' that global warming can be attributed to human activities. But whereas the report from the first working group was carefully couched in language of confidence and likelihood, many such phrases are absent from the policy-makers' summary of the second working group's report. Before the launch in Brussels, the report's lead authors stayed up all night deliberating the finer points of the policy-makers' summary, which boils more than 1,500 pages down to a mere 23. Several delegates from the research community stormed out during the negotiations, albeit to return later. China and Saudi Arabia, in particular, were said to have put pressure on to soften the language. Cynthia Rosenzweig of NASA, a lead author of the report and one of those who left the negotiating session, says that the differences over the confidence statements were because many of the government delegates wanted the statements to be ditched. \u201cBut we wanted governments to know that we felt strongly that the 'very high confidence' statement was justified,\u201d she says. Statements of confidence remain in many phrases of the summary, and the altered phrases now reflect the evidence used to support the findings. One passage reads, for instance, that \u201cObservational evidence from all continents and most oceans shows that many natural systems are being affected by regional climate changes, particularly temperature increases.\u201d Rosenzweig says: \u201cWe have a direct statement now, which in some ways implies a confidence level.\u201d Removing qualifications, she adds, \u201chas nothing to do with climate evangelism\u201d. Although the report's predictions are certainly serious, Parry denies that they are dire. \u201cIt is a good, tight process, and the real key is that governments have to buy into it \u2014 it is an intergovernmental panel,\u201d he says. That government buy-in should take the form of both adaptation and mitigation \u2014 the two buzzwords of how to deal with climate change. Although the second working group's brief was to examine only one of these approaches \u2014 adaptational measures, such as improved healthcare or flood defences \u2014 the report also included a chapter on combined approaches that involve both adaptation and mitigation, such as carbon-reducing policies. The third working group of the IPCC is due to release its report, specifically on mitigation, in Thailand on 4 May. Adaptation is the key to the next few decades, says Saleemul Huq of the International Institute for Environment and Development in London, one of the report's authors. The report says that even if no more carbon is put into the atmosphere, average warming of 0.6 \u00b0C can still be expected over the rest of the century. \u201cAdaptation is the only option in the short term,\u201d Huq says. \u201cHowever, as we extend to the longer term \u2014 the next ten or fifteen decades \u2014 the only solution for that is to do mitigation now. If we fail to do either of them now we will suffer.\u201d Ivo de Boer, executive secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, which governs the Kyoto Protocol regulating greenhouse-gas emissions, hopes that the report will provide impetus for negotiations for a climate treaty to replace Kyoto when it runs out in 2012. \u201cI hope it will make it clear to politicians that time is running out,\u201d he says. One of the cruel ironies is that among the few set to gain, at least in the short term, from the agricultural benefits conferred by climate warming are those with the highest greenhouse-gas emissions. And yet the central message of the report is that climate change is likely to hit hardest those who can do least to defend themselves. Nevertheless, the risks are not confined to poor countries, says IPCC chair Rajendra Pachauri. \u201cIt is the poorest of the poor, even in richer societies, who will be affected the most significantly,\u201d he says. \u201cPeople who are poor are least equipped to be able to adapt to the consequences of climate change.\u201d \n                     Special Report: From words to action \n                   \n                     Climate change 2007: What we don't know about climate change \n                   \n                     Climate change 2007: Data keep flooding in \n                   \n                     Climate change 2007: Climate sceptics switch focus to economics \n                   \n                     Climate change 2007: What price a cooler future? \n                   \n                     Climate change in focus \n                   \n                     Earth and environment news \n                   \n                     Policy news \n                   \n                     Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change \n                   \n                     Working Group II report \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

An article on Croatian dinosaur tracks that help to reveal the tectonic movements responsible for the creation of the Balkans has set off a modern-day continental clash. The situation raises questions about how far palaeontologists should have the right to prevent others from publishing on sites of interest that they discover. The huge sauropod footprints, dating from about 95 million years ago, were discovered in 2004 on the island of Hvar by a team from the Croatian Natural History Museum in Zagreb, led by Michael Caldwell of the University of Alberta in Edmonton, Canada. The museum announced the discovery of the site to the press. But before the researchers could publish their study in the scientific literature, a competing group from the University of Zagreb went to the site and then published an article reporting the tracks. The article did not credit the discovery team, and an angry Caldwell has demanded its retraction. The disputed article was published last December in the journal  Cretaceous Research  (A. Mezga  et al .  Cretac. Res.   27,  735\u2013742; 2006). The lead author was palaeontologist Aleksandar Mezga, working with three Croatian colleagues and a Swiss researcher. Caldwell says he believes that the publication amounts to \u201cintellectual theft\u201d, because it leaves his team unable to publish the discovery as its own. Caldwell's colleagues in Croatia declined to speak to  Nature , but e-mails from them provided by Caldwell suggest they support his interpretation of events. For example, when he learned of the article in February, Jakov Radovcic, a Croatian sedimentologist working with Caldwell, wrote: \u201cI was really shocked. I was not aware of the... behaviour of my colleagues from Zagreb.\u201d Mezga, however, insists that he and his team have done nothing wrong. \u201cEvery single word...is our intellectual property,\u201d he told  Nature . Because nothing had been published on the study site, Mezga says, he considered it open for reporting, although he acknowledges that he never contacted the discovery team to discuss the issue. David Batten, a researcher at the University of Manchester, UK, and editor-in-chief of  Cretaceous Research  at the time the article was published, told  Nature  that the journal is considering Caldwell's request for a retraction. Such a retraction would be \u201cvery unusual\u201d, says Catherine Badgely of the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor and president of the US-based Society of Vertebrate Paleontology. Documented instances of misappropriation of palaeontological sites are rare, surfacing about every five years, Badgely notes. But she welcomes discussion of the issue: \u201cIt is good this is being brought out.\u201d In this case, the tracks of a long-necked, plant-eating sauropod known as a titanosaur provide insight into massive tectonic shifts that occurred around 100 million years ago. The land mass that is now Africa was then shifting north against the Eurasian continent, raising and lowering geological structures across what have become the Balkan nations. The dinosaur tracks are the oldest to have been found in that region. But they also represent the most recent signs of life on a geological plain called the Adriatic\u2013Dinaric carbonate platform, before it sank beneath the sea 94 million years ago. And they provide an important clue about what other land the platform was connected to at the time. Caldwell and his colleagues were exploring Hvar's rocky shoreline when they happened upon the 10 pad marks \u2014 each about 30 centimetres long \u2014 in a 65-square-metre area of ground. It is common for museums to announce such discoveries, and the Hvar site drew wide news coverage. The second Zagreb team started working on the site within a couple of months. They brought with them Christian Meyer, an authority on dinosaur tracks and director of the Natural History Museum in Basel, Switzerland. When contacted by  Nature , Meyer declined to comment on the team's rights to the site, referring inquiries to his Croatian colleagues. But in an e-mail sent to Caldwell in February, he said his colleagues had told him no one else was studying the tracks. Actually, Caldwell's team was analysing tiny plankton fossils to pinpoint the date of the tracks. Those studies were delayed when samples being shipped from Croatia to Edmonton were misplaced for six months by an airline. Italian palaeontologist Fabio Dalla Vecchia was one of the reviewers of the  Cretaceous Research  article. He says he pointed out to the journal and the authors the need to fully credit the tracks' discoverers. But this did not happen (the journal admits receiving the request, but says that it was misunderstood). \u201cI had nasty experiences in Croatia,\u201d adds Dalla Vecchia. \u201cThe groups fight each other there.\u201d Caldwell says he is sad that things didn't work out differently. \u201cThis could have been such a good thing for Croatian research.\u201d \n                     Palaeontology: Hooked on fossils \n                   \n                     In the footsteps of dinosaurs \n                   \n                     Earth and environment news \n                   \n                     Michael Caldwell \n                   \n                     Hvar Island, Croatia \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Cosmologists gathered in London last month to voice their concerns over the current 'standard' model of the Universe. \u201cThere is a sense of desperation,\u201d says participant Douglas Scott, from the University of British Columbia in Vancouver. \u201cThe standard model is horribly ugly, but the data support it.\u201d For most in the field, that desperation stems from two unexplained ingredients in the standard model: dark matter, thought to help ordinary matter clump together to form galaxies; and dark energy, invoked to explain the observation that the expansion of the universe is accelerating. But physicists are increasingly questioning the model itself. Richard Lieu, from the University of Alabama in Huntsville, is one of those with doubts. He says he organized the meeting, at Imperial College London, \u201cfor scientists to come forward and present any misgivings they may have about the standard model\u201d, although he invited speakers from all sides of the debate. A broad consensus over the standard model has emerged over the past decade. It is based on diverse lines of evidence, such as measurements of the radiation left over from the early Universe (known as the cosmic microwave background), the distribution of galaxies and the brightness of distant supernovae. Scientists at the meeting were asked to re-examine assumptions made when these observations were analysed. For example, Subir Sarkar, from the University of Oxford, UK, argued that data from the Wilkinson Microwave Anistropy Probe (WMAP) \u2014 the NASA satellite that measured the cosmic microwave background with unprecedented precision \u2014 make sense without dark energy if density perturbations in the early Universe had a different pattern to that usually assumed, and if our patch of the Universe differs from other parts. This explanation might seem more complicated than the standard model, says Sarkar, but he counters that invoking dark energy is \u201ca profound problem from the viewpoint of fundamental physics\u201d. Attendees were also asked to question the actual data. Speakers pointed out oddities in WMAP's maps of the microwave sky, such as the alignment of patterns on different scales along what has been cheekily dubbed an 'axis of evil', and the presence of more variation in the southern hemisphere than in the northern. Such unlikely effects could just be statistical quirks, but they seed uncertainty about how the measurements are being interpreted.

The Aral Sea, whose disappearance counts as one of the world's worst environmental catastrophes, is making a modest recovery thanks to a series of water-management projects implemented by the World Bank and the government of Kazakhstan.  While the waters of the Aral Sea \u2014 now a chain of brackish lakes along the border of Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan \u2014 continue to shrink, one portion, the northern Aral in Kazakhstan, has been steadily rising thanks to improved flood levees and dam construction. Within the past year, the northern Aral has risen to the maximum holding capacity of its newly constructed dike \u2014 a process World Bank officials expected to take at least two or three years. \"The impact has been very swift and very important for the local people, both from a health point of view and from a livelihood point of view,\" says Joop Stoutjesdijk, team leader for the first phase of the World Bank's North Aral Sea project. Building on this success, the Kazakh government is now conducting preliminary research for the next phase of their project.  Daene McKinney, an environmental engineer with the Center for Research in Water Resources at the University of Texas, Austin, and a former director of the United States Agency for International Development, says he is encouraged by the news. But he's not entirely optimistic. He points out that while the northern Aral is making a modest recovery, the southern Aral is still drying up.  \"You have to be careful of being overly optimistic,\" he says. \"If you ask: 'are they saving the Aral Sea?' the answer is clearly no.\"  \n              High and dry \n            During the 1960s, the two rivers that fed the Aral \u2014 the Syr Darya, which empties into the northern Aral, and the Amu Darya, which empties into the southern Aral in Uzbekistan \u2014 were drastically diverted in order to increase agricultural efficiency under the Soviet regime.  The result is that the Aral, once the world's fourth largest inland body of water, has been steadily shrinking from the 67,000-square-kilometre sea that it was in the mid-1960s. At present it consists of a series of lakes, containing in total only about 10% of the sea's original volume 1 . Between 1987 and 1989 the water dropped severely, splitting the sea into two: the small northern Aral and the large southern Aral. Port towns were left stranded high and dry. \"There were billions of cubic metres of water lost per year during the 1990s, says Stoutjesdijk. Where there was once water and a thriving fishery, there is now desert wasteland, economic depression and disease; as the waters recede, they expose salt and sediment laced with agricultural residues \u2014 pesticides and chemical fertilizers \u2014 which have been linked to an increase in respiratory diseases and certain forms of cancer in the bordering communities.  \n              Action plan \n            In 2001, the Kazakh government embarked on a US$85-million water-management project, securing $64.5 million in loans from the World Bank. The funds were used to improve the flow of the Syr Darya by constructing flood levees, improving hydraulic irrigation systems, and building dams to prevent over-spill from rivers and stop water draining from the northern Aral into the southern Aral.  Construction was completed in August 2005 and, by May 2006, the northern Aral had spread by nearly 900-3,300 square kilometres and risen by 3 metres \u2014 an impressive recovery. Previous attempts to contain the waters of the northern Aral with earthen dikes had failed and it wasn't clear whether or not the inflow originating from the Syd Darya river would be enough to significantly raise the water level.  With increased freshwater flow, the northern Aral's salinity is returning back to normal and, as a result, several species of freshwater fish have returned. And fishermen are once again casting their nets. \"We're being told that for the first time since independence, they're exporting fish to the Ukraine again,\" says Stoutjesdijk.  \n              North and south \n            McKinney says he is encouraged by the northern Aral's recovery. \"It means that the water flow originating from the Syr Darya is enough to raise the northern Aral Sea up to levels that are adequate for the fish population and for the people who use them,\" he says.  But to save the entire sea, he notes, all of the water that is currently diverted from the Syr Darya and Amu Darya rivers for agricultural use would have to be directed back into the Aral. This is entirely unrealistic because agriculture, particularly of cotton, is a pillar of the Kazakh, Uzbek and other central Asian economies.  Still, the Kazakh government is eager to enhance the recovery of the northern Aral, and has begun preparations for a second stage of the project. Stoutjesdijk says he will be meeting with the Kazakh government sometime in 2008 to discuss further funding.  \n             Visit our  \n             \n                 newsblog \n               \n              to read and post comments about this story. \n           \n                   Central Asia Regional Water Information Base \n                 \n                   Aral Sea Info \n                 \n                   World Bank: Aral Sea Project \n                 \n                   World Bank: Ecological and Economic improvement of the Syd Darya Basin \n                 Reprints and Permissions"},

The drought that spawned the great American Dust Bowl of the 1930s may become the new climatic norm for much of the southwestern United States and other subtropical regions of the world. In a report published today, researchers in the United States and Israel project an imminent increase in aridity in subtropical regions over the next century, which will affect several important agricultural regions. The results indicate that growing drought in the southwest is a problem that is likely to affect agriculture. \"This is something that is already under way. It's not an end of the twenty-first century thing where we have the luxury to sit around and wait,\" says Richard Seager, a climatologist with the Lamont Doherty Earth Observatory in New York, who led the 13-member research team. Seager and his colleagues looked at data from a number of computer climate models used in the International Panel on Climate Change's (IPCC) most recent report. Under the IPCC's 'business as usual' emission scenario, in which carbon dioxide emissions increase until mid-century and level off at around 720 parts per million by 2100, these models had already predicted a general increase in global mean temperature and in the likelihood of droughts over the twenty-first century. But Seager's team delved deeper, to see how arid the subtropical regions are likely to become. They focused specifically on the southwestern United States and northern Mexico, because those areas are already showing signs of drying. But their findings are also applicable to the arid and semi-arid regions of southern Europe, Mediterranean northern Africa and the Middle East.  The result, published in  Science 1 , shows a reduction in moisture in these areas \u2014 on the order of 15% over the next two or three decades, says Seager. Moisture is defined as the mean annual rainfall minus the amount of water expected to be lost to evaporation, a measure that reflects the amount of water useful for agriculture.  \"It's important to remember that for the Dust Bowl, the precipitation over the western United States was only about 15% less than normal \u2014 so you don't need a lot,\" says Seager. Seager points out that this does not mean that the southwest will necessarily relive the disastrous effects of the 1930s drought. The catastrophic dust storms of the Dirty Thirties were more the result of poor farming practice and land management, he says, than the drought alone.  \n              Winds of change \n            The study attributes the increased aridity to the poleward expansion of the Hadley cell, an atmospheric circulation system that today transports moist, warm air from the equator to the northern and southern mid-latitudes. The result is an expansion of subtropical arid regions, and a poleward push of the rain bands that provide precipitation in the higher latitudes. \"This is not part of a regional peculiarity,\" says Seager, \"but part of a hemispheric pattern.\" Lending credence to Seager's study is evidence that the Hadley cell is already expanding 2 . \"This is a robust prediction that's been backed by observation,\" says Dennis Hartmann, a climatologist in the Department of Atmospheric Sciences at the University of Washington, Seattle. \"It seems like a reasonable scenario for the future.\"  The implications for such a drying are far-reaching. California, for instance, accounts for approximately 16% of all US agricultural exports. Seager suggests that North American farmers need to rethink certain agricultural practices, including adopting more water-efficient irrigation systems such as those being used in Israel. And, where there are water shortages, there is also the potential for political conflict. \"As Mark Twain wrote, 'Whiskey is for drinking. Water is for fighting over',\" says Seager. Mexico depends on water originating from the Colorado River, he notes, whereas Iraq and Syria depend on the waters of the Euphrates, which originate in Turkey. Cross-border conflicts are likely to arise as these streams of water dry up. \n             Visit our  \n             \n                 newsblog \n               \n              to read and post comments about this story. \n           \n                   Climate Change in Focus \n                 \n                   Lamont Doherty Earth Observatory's Drought Research page \n                 Reprints and Permissions"},

Paris The relics of St Joan of Arc are not the remains of the fifteenth-century French heroine after all, according to European experts who have analysed the sacred scraps. Instead, they say the relics are a forgery, made from the remains of an Egyptian mummy. Joan was burned at the stake in 1431 in Rouen, Normandy. The relics were discovered in 1867 in a jar in the attic of a Paris pharmacy, with the inscription \u201cRemains found under the stake of Joan of Arc, virgin of Orleans\u201d. They were recognized by the Church, and are now housed in a museum in Chinon that belongs to the Archdiocese of Tours. Philippe Charlier, a forensic scientist at Raymond Poincar\u00e9 Hospital in Garches, near Paris, obtained permission to study the relics from the French church last year. He says he was \u201castonished\u201d by the results. \u201cI'd never have thought that it could be from a mummy.\u201d Charlier and his colleagues didn't have much to work with: the relics comprise a charred-looking human rib, chunks of what seem to be carbonized wood, a 15-centimetre fragment of linen and a cat femur \u2014 consistent with the medieval practice of throwing black cats onto the pyre of supposed witches. \n               Sniff tests \n             The researchers used a battery of techniques to investigate the remains, including mass, infrared and atomic-emission spectrometry, electron microscopy, pollen analysis and, unusually, the help of the leading 'noses' of the perfume industry: Sylvaine Delacourte from Guerlain, and Jean-Michel Duriez from Jean Patou. Odour analysis is a new technique for palaeopathology, but Charlier says that he hit on the idea after being struck by the variety of odours of other historical corpses. Delacourte and Duriez sniffed the relics and nine other samples of bone and hair from Charlier's lab without being told what the samples were. They were also not allowed to confer. Both smelled hints of 'burnt plaster' and 'vanilla' in the samples from the relics. The plaster smell was consistent with the fact that Joan of Arc was burnt on a plaster stake, not a wooden one, to make the whole macabre spectacle last longer. But vanilla is inconsistent with cremation. \u201cVanillin is produced during decomposition of a body,\u201d says Charlier. \u201cYou would find it in a mummy, but not in someone who was burnt.\u201d Other, more conventional, evidence pointing to a mummy origin quickly accumulated. Microscopic and chemical analysis of the black crust on the rib and on the cat femur showed that they were not in fact burnt, but were impregnated with a vegetal and mineral matrix, with no trace of muscle, skin, fat or hair. \u201cI see burnt remains all the time in my job,\u201d says Charlier. \u201cIt was obviously not burnt tissue.\u201d The black material was, however, consistent with an embalming mix of wood resins, bitumen and chemicals such as malachite. It was also consistent with gypsum, which gives the mix its plaster smell. The linen cloth had a coating characteristic of mummy wrappings. And large amounts of pine pollen were present. Pine trees did not grow in Normandy at the time that Joan of Arc was killed, but pine resin was used widely in Egypt during embalming. Two other lines of evidence seem to clinch the mummy origin. Carbon-14 analysis dated the remains to between the third and sixth centuries BC. And the spectrometry profiles of the rib, femur and black chunks matched those from Egyptian mummies from the period, and not those of burnt bones. Charlier points out that mummies were used in Europe during the Middle Ages in pharmaceutical remedies. The 1867 discovery date also fits the period when Joan of Arc, who had been forgotten for centuries, was rediscovered by historians and created as a national myth. Someone might have forged the relics at this time in an attempt to reinforce her importance. \u201cIt is a fascinating project,\u201d says Anastasia Tsaliki, a palaeopathologist at the University of Durham, UK. Palaeopathology is a small but emerging field that attempts to use forensic science to inform history, traditionally a social science. \u201cPhilippe's work goes a step further by showing how forensic methods can be combined with tools used in archaeometry, archaeobotany and osteology,\u201d says Tsaliki. \n               Fire-proof organs \n             Part of the legend of Joan of Arc springs from the observation, documented in historical records, that some of her organs resisted the fire. Hundreds of pages of surviving manuscripts describe in vivid detail how she was burnt three times over to try to ensure that nothing but ash remained, and so prevent her remains being worshipped. The observation of remaining organs was interpreted as a miracle. But science has another explanation. \u201cIn fact, it is very difficult to totally cremate a body; organs such as the heart and intestines, which have a high water content, are very resistant to fire,\u201d says Charlier. \u201cWe see it all the time in forensics.\u201d Debunking the relics of Joan of Arc will be less controversial than doing the same for the Shroud of Turin, but is still likely to generate large public interest, especially in France. The Church is ready to accept the results, according to Charlier. \n                     Forensic science: Ghost buster \n                   \n                     Rules murky on DNA-based identification of disaster victims \n                   \n                     Copernicus unearthed? \n                   \n                     To know a veil \n                   \n                     Joan of Arc on Wikipedia \n                   \n                     Paleopathology Association \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Beijing China has announced an ambitious attempt to bring the ancient practice of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) into line with modern standards. The government says it will expand basic and clinical research, and improve the testing and developing of TCM remedies for export. But critics question whether the research will meet the scientific standards necessary for international recognition. Although China has invested in TCM before, the 15-year plan involves a change of direction and will receive significantly more money. The project is backed by 16 Chinese ministries, spearheaded by the Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST), the Ministry of Health and the State Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine (SATCM). Zou Jian-qiang, director of MOST's health and biotechnology division, says the government has earmarked 1 billion yuan (US$130 million) for TCM research and development, with the total budget over the next five years increasing to at least 5\u20136 times as much as the previous total of 740 million yuan. In a country where most of the population is not covered by the public healthcare system and cannot afford to go to hospital, there is also a tenfold increase in money for the TCM-related part of the public healthcare system to 8.5 billion yuan. \u201cChinese medicine, which has served the Chinese people since antiquity, still has an important role in today's healthcare, especially in areas where people do not have access to, or could not afford, treatments based on Western medicine,\u201d says Yu Wen-ming, deputy director of SATCM. The initiative comes after heated discussions on TCM throughout China. Last year, Zhang Gong-yao, a scholar at the Central South University in Changsha, Hunan, sparked a national debate when he published an article titled \u201cFarewell to Traditional Chinese Medicine\u201d in the Chinese journal  Medicine and Philosophy  ( 27,  14\u201317; 2006). Zhang argued that TCM is a pseudoscience and should not be part of public healthcare and research. All sides of the argument have been keenly awaiting the government's stance, and it has come down firmly in favour of promoting TCM as a science. China is desperate to earn regulatory approval for TCM remedies abroad, and hopes to globalize TCM by 2020. The world market for Chinese herbal medicine has doubled over the past decade, with Europe and the United States being the biggest importers. But the patchy safety record of TCM from China has led to a steady decline in its exports, and it has lost market share to neighbouring nations such as Japan and South Korea. So China's plan specifies strategies to boost standards, including conducting clinical research on the safety and efficacy of TCM remedies, encouraging international collaboration, improving manufacturing techniques and bringing the drug regulatory system into line with international guidelines. More controversial is the government's shift in approach. Previous attempts to develop scientifically tested drugs from TCM have focused on isolating active ingredients from the remedies and screening them one at a time. This has led to a handful of new treatments, such as artemisinin for treating malaria and the decongestant ephedrine, but there has been no goldrush of approved drugs. The new plan aims to develop methodologies to test TCM's more traditional features and principles. The practice takes a holistic approach to disease treatment, so rather than using one drug to treat a particular disease, complex combinations of plant extracts are used. Each mixture is personalized to the symptoms and characteristics of the patient. TCM practitioners and researchers are still waiting to see whether the government will actually come up with the money, but they have generally welcomed the plan. \u201cIt's a significant step forward,\u201d says Liu Ping, vice-president of Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine. Some, however, are reluctant to jump on the bandwagon. A professor at the China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences in Beijing, who asked not be named, reckons that after thousands of years of practice and development, TCM is already close to perfect and that modernization will simply distort its essence. Shi-min Fang, a US-trained biochemist who now runs a website called 'New Threads' that fights pseudoscience and research misconduct in China, is also unimpressed by the plan, but for opposite reasons. He is in favour of scientific research into Chinese herbal remedies, but thinks the emphasis on testing the theories of TCM is misplaced. \u201cThe basic concepts of Chinese medicine, such as yin and yang, wu xing (the five elements) and the qi (meridian) theory, are inaccurate descriptions of the human body that verge on imaginative,\u201d he says. \u201cThe government has already spent a lot of money trying to prove their mechanistic basis, but this hasn't gone anywhere.\u201d Wang Ming-wei, director of the National Centre for Drug Screening at the Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, agrees: \u201cTo truly modernize Chinese medicine, we must first demystify these theories.\u201d Some critics also worry that the plan doesn't set strict enough scientific standards. Although clinical research is listed as a priority, the plan doesn't specify whether there should be randomized, controlled trials in which neither practitioners nor patients know who is receiving active remedy and who is getting a placebo. And there is no requirement for TCM researchers to publish in internationally recognized journals. \u201cMost research on TCM in the past is of poor quality, and is published only in Chinese medical journals without proper peer-review processes,\u201d remarks Wang. \u201cWithout a clear position from the government, it is unlikely that the situation will change.\u201d Another concern is that the government does not specify how it will control the way in which research funding is allocated. Some critics feel that resources are currently being circulated only among certain favoured universities and institutes, and argue that reform to ensure that TCM grants are based on merit is necessary if any real progress is to be achieved. Otherwise, as Jia Wei, associate dean of the pharmacy school at Shanghai Jiaotong University, puts it, the initiative will be just \u201cloud thunder, small raindrops\u201d. Zou says that the government is aware of the controversy and problems surrounding TCM, and that the plan, on which it has consulted widely, is set to resolve these issues. Su Gang-qiang, deputy director-general of SATCM's science and technology department, points out that the plan outlines overall principles and long-term directions for the development of TCM, rather than going into details, and says that further strategies will be published to specify exactly how the schemes will be carried out. Whether the government will take critics' concerns into account while drafting these plans remains to be seen, but many are cautiously optimistic. \u201cThe wind is now right for the development of TCM,\u201d says Jia. \u201cLet's hope this will not be a missed opportunity.\u201d \n                     News Feature: Medicine of the masses \n                   \n                     China's biomedical research takes flight in new directions \n                   \n                     Medical research news channel \n                   \n                     State Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine \n                   \n                     New Threads \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

There were audible gasps and spontaneous applause at a neuroscience meeting in Salt Lake City, Utah, in February, when Ed Boyden described a protein that switches off nerve firing when activated by light. And when Karl Deisseroth told the fuller story of the protein, called NpHR and published in this week's  Nature , at Cold Spring Harbor in New York late last month, there was talk of a revolution in neuroscience. It is perhaps no surprise that intellectual-property disputes are looming. The revolution could consign electrodes \u2014 neuroscience's staple tools \u2014 to the trash after a century of faithful service. They would be replaced by genetically engineered proteins that allow investigators to stimulate or inhibit very precise groups of nerves at the flick of a light switch. No previous technology has come close to this level of control and precision. \u201cIt is incredibly exciting \u2014 now we can really start to investigate how different neuronal cell types contribute to the neural circuits that mediate all sorts of behaviours,\u201d says Carl Petersen of the EPFL Brain Mind Institute in Lausanne, Switzerland. Petersen has already received the NpHR protein from Deisseroth's lab at Stanford University in California and is rushing to use it in his research on sensory perception. \u201cIt is the best thing that has happened in neuroscience in a good long time.\u201d This feeling of urgency pervades the field. The technology is so powerful that leaps are predicted in many areas. With such prizes to be won, there is also a rush to publish. Boyden, a former postdoc of Deisseroth's who left Stanford shortly after the NpHR work began and is now at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Cambridge, hurried through a report last month on the activity of NpHR in cultured brain cells (X. Han and E. S. Boyden  PLoS One   2,  e299; 2007). Boyden says he thinks the idea belongs to him, but both MIT and Stanford are pursuing patents. The  Nature  paper has resulted from a collaboration between researchers in Germany and at Stanford University. It extends the collaboration's 2005 work, conducted with Boyden, on a channel for positively charged ions (such as calcium) that is found in green algae and is activated by blue light. In that work, the researchers transplanted the channel, ChR2, into mammalian neurons. For the first time, it was possible to stimulate a nerve remotely at speeds close to normal neuronal transmission (E. S. Boyden  Nature Neurosci.   8,  1263\u20131268; 2005). Numerous research groups have already begun to use this 'on switch'. The newly reported NpHR protein (see  page 633 ) is exciting researchers even more. Identified in an archaeal species called  Natronomonas pharaonis , it pumps chloride ions into cells, silencing physiological activity, when activated by yellow light. \u201cThe 'on switch' means we can replace the crude electrode, which stimulates all types of neurons in its vicinity,\u201d says Deisseroth. \u201cBut with the 'off switch' we can start to understand what is going on physiologically \u2014 or pathologically.\u201d By turning off sets of neurons in turn, researchers can investigate which ones are necessary, or sufficient, to elicit a particular behaviour or response. Deisseroth and his colleagues have transferred the genes for NpHR and ChR2 into the nematode  Caenorhabditis elegans , and can start the worms' swimming movements with flashes of blue light and stop them with yellow light. They also showed that functional proteins are produced when the genes are injected into the brains of young mice. In addition to his research, Deisseroth holds a weekly psychiatric clinic, in which he assesses whether severely depressed patients are suitable for a treatment called deep-brain stimulation. In this procedure, electrodes are implanted deep in the brain to try to activate the neuronal circuits that lift mood. But the technique is crude and experimental, and Deisseroth says that the plight of his patients made him want to find something better. The light-operated proteins might eventually replace electrodes in deep-brain stimulation, allowing physicians to hit just those neurons relevant to the disease being treated, although this would require a safe way to transfer the proteins into human brain cells. The technique could also have shorter-term clinical implications. For example, Gary Matthews of the State University of New York at Stony Brook hopes to use the switches to persuade retinal neurons, which don't respond directly to light, to mimic the responses elicited by rods and cones, to see whether this could help restore vision. But the immediate use for the technology will be dissecting the role of different types of neurons in the circuits of both healthy and diseased brains. Deisseroth plans to use mice that express both proteins to identify targets relevant to depression, whereas Boyden plans work on mouse models of epilepsy, depression and Parkinson's disease. Both researchers are distributing the NpHR protein to colleagues around the world, such as Sergey Kasparov at the University of Bristol, UK, who studies neurotransmitter release. When Kasparov heard about Deisseroth's work, he jettisoned a complicated plan to silence neurons that use noradrenaline as a transmitter: \u201cThe question we were posing is better answered by the light-activated protein technology.\u201d Another researcher keen to use the protein is David Kleinfeld of the University of California, San Diego, who is tracing the neuronal pathways that mediate touch sensations. \u201cI moved very quickly to get a material-transfer agreement after we heard Deisseroth talk about the work,\u201d he says. \u201cWe are really psyched up about it.\u201d But Petersen cautions that the intellectual-property issues surrounding such a significant technology \u201cshould be huge\u201d. So far, the parties involved are commenting little on the conflicting claims. Deisseroth points out that Boyden was supported by his Stanford lab when the work on NpHR began there. But both claims may have to fight their way round a 1991 patent awarded to Japanese scientists, which broadly covers light-activated channels. \n                     Neuroscience: Deep in thought \n                   \n                     Brain machine interfaces \n                   \n                     Ed Boyden's lab \n                   \n                     Karl Deisseroth's lab \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

In a major victory for environmentalists, the US Supreme Court this week ruled that the federal government must regulate carbon dioxide emitted from cars and trucks. In a strongly worded opinion issued on 2 April, the justices brushed aside insistence from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) that it did not have the authority under the Clean Air Act to regulate greenhouse-gas emissions from vehicles. They also disagreed with the agency's contention that even if it had the authority, it doesn't have to regulate if it doesn't want to. \u201cThe use of the word 'judgment' is not a roving license to ignore the statutory text,\u201d wrote Justice John Stevens. \u201cUnder the clear terms of the Clean Air Act, EPA can avoid taking further action only if it determines that greenhouse gases do not contribute to climate change or if it provides some reasonable explanation as to why it cannot or will not exercise its discretion to determine whether they do.\u201d Led by Massachusetts, the case was brought by several states, a handful of environmental groups and American Samoa. They argued that climate change was, among other things, causing the sea to rise up and swallow some states' territory and that the EPA was breaking the law by refusing to consider greenhouse gases as 'pollutants', which it has to regulate under the Clean Air Act. The EPA denied this on a number of grounds, including appealing to the intentions of Congress when creating the act, and the desirability of using the promise of reducing emissions as a lever to force developing countries to do the same \u2014 something that wouldn't be possible if the EPA was already regulating them (see  Nature   443 , 486\u2013487; 2006). Lead author of the petition for Massachusetts, Lisa Heinzerling of Georgetown University Law Center in Washington DC, is naturally pleased with the outcome: \u201cOn every single issue we won, and I think we won big.\u201d The ruling means that the EPA must now evaluate greenhouse gases and determine whether they are \u201cair pollution which may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare\u201d. If it finds that they are, it must regulate them. But there is no timeline for how quickly it must do this. The EPA under the Bush administration \u201cwill not move on it at all\u201d, says David Bookbinder, director of climate litigation at environmental group the Sierra Club, who was among the petitioners. \u201cThey have 18 months [left], they are a lame duck; they are not interested in climate-change regulation.\u201d It is more likely that the next US president will begin to regulate greenhouse-gas emissions through the Clean Air Act, he says, if Congress doesn't get there first by passing climate-change laws. Certainly, many of the Democrats in Congress would love to regulate emissions in a similar manner to the European Union's Emission Trading Scheme. Senator Barbara Boxer (Democrat, California), head of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, plans to call EPA officials to Capitol Hill later this month to ask them how they will begin regulating climate change. In a statement, she said: \u201cWe now have a two-track process for addressing global warming \u2014 comprehensive legislation and administrative action. The EPA is \u201creviewing the court's decision to determine the appropriate course of action\u201d, says spokeswoman Jennifer Wood, adding that \u201cthe Bush administration has an unparalleled financial, international and domestic commitment to reducing greenhouse-gas emissions\u201d \u2014 a slightly bizarre contention, to say the least. \n                     The politics of breathing \n                   \n                     Climate in court \n                   \n                     Earth and environment news channel \n                   \n                     The Supreme Court opinion \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

By any standards, it was a controversial reign. It started with an investigation into the purchase of feathers from endangered birds; not what you might expect from a man with ultimate responsibility for one of the world's most prestigious natural history museums. It ended last week amid media claims of lavish expense accounts, including thousands of dollars for the upkeep of a private swimming pool and the cleaning of a chandelier. It is unlikely that many tears were shed at the Smithsonian Institution on 26 March, when officials announced that Larry Small had resigned. The departure of Small, who has led the 19 museums and 9 research centres that make up the institution since 2000, closes one of the more turbulent periods in the organization's 160-year history. Yet researchers at the institution say that the problems they face run deeper than those allegedly caused by Small's management approach (see  'A lavish seven years' ). For around 15 years, the Smithsonian's core research budgets have eroded, forcing administrators to rely increasingly on outside funds. And although donors can often be persuaded to stump up for glamorous projects such as new exhibitions, finding funds for research costs is much more challenging. As a result, although Small carried out much-needed repairs and launched new museums, he did not stop the slide in funding for research and training. Of the nearly US$1 billion he raised in private money, almost all went to infrastructure projects such as new galleries, rather than to research. \u201cThis issue won't go away because Larry has gone,\u201d warns Stephen Murray, deputy director for science at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Smithsonian officials say that they don't have figures for how much money from the institution's overall budget goes towards science, but research leaders think that the attrition in funding has hit many areas. Researchers from a variety of specialities told  Nature  that as many as a third of full-time positions have been lost from their departments over the past 15 or so years. Where centres have prospered, it has generally been because they tapped into funding streams that became national priorities, such as money for research on climate change and its effects, or could raise money from philanthropic sources. Although researchers think that a mix of funding streams is a good thing, they don't want this strategy to replace core federal funding. For example, the Smithsonian's centres hold records on forest growth and bird migration and behaviour that span 25 years. Such long-term data \u2014 one of the institution's great strengths \u2014 are hard to maintain with agency grants, which generally run for only three to five years. \u201cThe value of long-term monitoring depends on its continuity,\u201d says Ira Rubinoff, acting under-secretary for science at the institution. Rubinoff, has secured a private donation to maintain the forest work, but only for five more years. Like other researchers, he says that he now needs to devote more time to fundraising. With this history in mind, Smithsonian scientists say that beefing up core funding should be a priority for the next director. That feeling is shared by the new acting head, Cristi\u00e1n Samper, director of the National Museum of Natural History in Washington DC, where core funding has decreased by around 3% a year over the past eight years. Samper hopes that the trend can be reversed by improving the advertising of Smithsonian research to Congress and the public, in part by getting more of that science into the exhibitions that the Smithsonian runs. Samper is one of many names being suggested in discussions over Small's successor, but he comments only that he would be happy to remain as head permanently, or to go back to running the national museum. The search is being run by members of the museum's Board of Regents and is expected to take about a year. \n                     Report backs Smithsonian research \n                   \n                     Oceanographer navigates path to the Smithsonian \n                   \n                     Smithsonian rocked by high-level departure \n                   \n                     Staff suggest cure for Smithsonian woes \n                   \n                     Smithsonian Institution \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Earlier this month, around 60 of China's top orthopaedic surgeons and neurosurgeons met at a military hospital in the southwest provincial capital, Kunming. Over three days of discussion and joint operations on two monkeys, the surgeons reached a consensus on how and where incisions should be made to transplant materials in spinal-cord treatment. \u201cIt's hard to get a bunch of prima-donna surgeons to agree,\u201d says Wise Young, a neuroscientist studying spinal-cord injuries at Rutgers University in Piscataway, New Jersey. \u201cWe need to have them roll up their sleeves and do it.\u201d Young, originally from Hong Kong, is preparing a network of surgeons to address a big problem in China: maverick doctors, pushed by growing medical tourism, are increasingly transplanting cells or drugs into injured spines despite having only anecdotal support for their effectiveness. There is also little rigorous follow-up of the patients, so although many procedures are done, the field does not advance. But Chinese local and national governments are increasingly requiring doctors to use clinically proven procedures. \u201cPeople are starting to demand data,\u201d says Young. Young's network \u2014 called China SCINet and based in Hong Kong \u2014 aims to provide those data. Its first major trial will test a combination therapy of lithium and stem cells. Starting in 2008, the team will transplant umbilical-cord stem cells to around 400 patients. Half of the patients will also receive lithium, which stimulates the growth of neurons, in the same oral doses as those prescribed for manic depression (L.-W. Yick, K.-F. So, P. T. Cheung and W. Wu  J. Neurotrauma   21 , 932\u2013943; 2004). The idea is that the stem cells will provide a 'bridge' at the injury site, which new axons can grow on. Twenty centres in the network are already doing an observational study on the patients who will be in the trial, to get a baseline from which to judge improvement from the therapy. Young also hopes to involve industry. He is negotiating with pharmaceutical companies to provide a third element to add to the mix \u2014 drugs known to block the chemicals that inhibit growth of neurons. Young says that he has two main reasons to work in China. The number of patients living with spinal-cord injuries has increased over the past decade, which Young attributes to the growth of the automobile market and better care, which keeps patients alive longer. China now has more of these patients than any other country. In addition, it is fast and cheap to run trials there. Large numbers of patients gather in relatively few hospitals, making recruitment easy. \u201cYou can get hundreds, or even thousands, of patients at a single centre,\u201d says Young. And the cost of surgery and after-care is about US$20,000 per patient in China \u2014 about a fifth of that in the United States. The combination therapy in the trial will be preceded by preliminary studies on lithium and umbilical-cord transplants separately, the first of which will begin next month. Together, the trials will cost just US$12 million. The 2008 trial will be the first controlled study for spinal-cord injury in a country where doctors have increasingly been transplanting all kinds of cells. The most famous example is Hongyun Huang from Chaoyang Hospital in Beijing, who has performed hundreds of procedures in China after working with Young as a postdoctoral student at Rutgers (see  Nature   437 , 810\u2013811; 2005 and  440 , 850\u2013851; doi:10.1038/440850b 2006 ). These studies tend to claim that the treatments are effective, often on the basis of patient testimony, without peer review or any rigorous follow-up. Huang is now carrying out trials with fetal Schwann cells, fetal olfactory cells and a combination of the two, which he says have a strong scientific basis. But his critics remain sceptical. Huang has \u201chad a thousand or so chances so far to acquire scientific data\u201d, says James Guest, a neuroscientist with the Miami Project, a huge spinal-cord-injury research centre at the University of Miami in Florida, referring to the number of patients Huang has treated. Guest says he hopes that Young's network will \u201cstandardize spinal-cord injury care within China\u201d, adding that \u201ca success of this venture could do a lot to establish China as a credible place to do multicentre trials\u201d. Young's reputation, including his work with one of the first successful treatments for spinal-cord injury, methylprednisolone, should set the project in good stead. \u201cThere is no doubt that he can run a clinical trial,\u201d says John Steeves, director of the International Collaboration On Repair Discoveries at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver. But there are concerns that the procedure and follow-up must be high level and consistent across the trial. \u201cHaving a lot of patients does not necessarily mean you can test them all in a controlled, valid manner,\u201d says Steeves. And Guest worries whether a cultural aversion to admitting problems might hamper data sharing: \u201cWill the adverse events really be disclosed?\u201d he asks. Some spinal-cord clinicians also suggest that more animal data should be collected for lithium and umbilical cells before moving to humans. Young says he knows that the difficulty will now be in the trial's execution. But he argues that even establishing a network in a country where harsh competition makes researchers and doctors hesitant to collaborate is a huge achievement: \u201cThey used to say, 'no way, I'm not letting Dr so-and-so come into my hospital'. But now they are pooling resources and setting up joint teams.\u201d \n                     Fetal-cell therapy: Paper chase \n                   \n                     Patients warned about unproven spinal surgery \n                   \n                     http://www.nature.com/news/channels/medicalresearch.html \n                   \n                     CareCure Community encyclopedia \n                   \n                     ICORD \n                   \n                     The Miami Project \n                   \n                     Clinical trials centre \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Did Darwin delay publishing his theory of evolution by natural selection because he feared an outcry from the establishment? This has been a popular belief, and has been stoked by the fact that although Darwin began formulating the theory in 1837, he did not publish  On the Origin of Species  until 1859. Now John van Wyhe, a science historian at the University of Cambridge, UK, says that after a painstaking trawl through the letters, notes and books written by, to or about Darwin, he can rule out the idea once and for all. But van Wyhe's work has irritated several prominent historians, who argue that he has gone too far in downplaying ideas about Darwin's reluctance to publish. \u201cPortraying Darwin as having no feelings or reactions to the outside world warps the biographical picture,\u201d says David Kohn, editor of the Darwin Digital Library of Evolution. Darwin scholars have long pondered over the time it took to publish  Origin of Species . According to van Wyhe, the idea that Darwin delayed because he was scared to publish a theory that so obviously contradicted religious beliefs about creation has dominated both popular and scholarly accounts of the man for decades. But in a study published this week in  Notes and Records of the Royal Society  (doi:10.1098/rsnr.2006.0171; 2007), van Wyhe concludes that there is no direct evidence for the idea, and that it is simply a myth that has passed down the generations without question. To carry out his study, Van Wyhe searched for the word \u201cdelay\u201d in primary and secondary sources covering the period in which Darwin was working on  Origin of Species . He says Darwin and those who knew him never unambiguously referred to a delay in publishing, or gave any explanation for the 20-year 'gap'. Indeed, in all the texts on Darwin, he says, the earliest reference to a delay appears in the 1940s. Only in a 1948 popular book,  Darwin: Before and After , in which Robert Clark describes how Darwin was made ill by \u201can uncertainty that he allowed to haunt him for twenty years\u201d, do you see all the elements of the modern story, says van Wyhe. The historian further argues that in letters to friends, family and colleagues, Darwin continually communicated his belief that species could change, and that this is inconsistent with the notion that he was keeping his heretical ideas secret during this period. He even paid copiers on at least two occasions to produce early drafts of his species theory. By documenting exactly what he was doing during the 'gap years', van Wyhe makes the case that Darwin just didn't get down to writing  Origin of Species  until he had completed other work in hand, including an eight-year study of barnacles. He was determined to build a formidable mass of documentation supporting his theory and to solve major stumbling blocks, such as that posed by non-reproductive castes of social insects. This, together with a busy personal life but poor health, filled the years. In other words, Darwin did not postpone publication; he just didn't publish until he was ready. \u201cIn my view, this settles the question once and for all,\u201d says van Wyhe. Janet Browne, a science historian at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, reckons that van Wyhe's study is a valuable piece of work. \u201cIt may not shake the world, but it's an important point to make,\u201d she says. But several Darwin scholars are not convinced. Kohn and others agree that the way in which cultural and social pressures influenced Darwin's decisions may have been overplayed, particularly in the public arena, with less attention being paid to the involved process of scientific discovery. But the consensus in the field is likely to remain that a multitude of factors underpinned Darwin's delay. Kohn points out that searching for explicit references to a \u201cdelay\u201d is a simplistic approach to the problem, and that other factors should be considered. For example, Darwin often criticized religion in his notebooks, which suggests that he would have been aware of the probable implications of his theory for religion. It is hard to see how the absence of specific references to a delay rules out any influence of cultural and societal factors on Darwin's decisions, agrees David Quammen, author of  The Reluctant Mr Darwin . Kohn also points out that in Darwin's later publication  The Descent of Man , which applied the theory of evolution to humans, Darwin specifically states in the opening lines that he delayed publishing this tome until he was convinced that the climate was right. It seems likely, therefore, that he would have been aware of the controversy his theories would cause from the outset, and probably avoided discussing humans in  Origin of Species  for this reason. \n                     A life online \n                   \n                     Darwin's cheque found in portrait frame \n                   \n                     Darwin Digital Library \n                   \n                     The complete work of Charles Darwin online \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Bangalore A biotechnology company in Bangalore has launched a project to build a genetic, genealogical and medical database of India's 69,000-strong Parsi community. Parsis are thought to be particularly genetically homogenous, so researchers hope to use the data to identify genes involved in disease and develop new treatments and diagnostics \u2014 in a similar way to a national genetic database already set up in Iceland. Fleeing persecution by invading Arabs, the Parsis arrived in India from Persia 1,200 years ago, around the same time that a few hundred Vikings arrived in Iceland. They speak a unique Indian dialect and their religion forbids marriage outside the community, so they have remained relatively inbred. \u201cI realized four years ago that I was sitting on a goldmine or a powder keg,\u201d says Villoo Morawala Patell, a Parsi and molecular biologist who founded the biotech company Avesthagen in 1998. Patell says she refers to a powder keg because of the fear that Parsis will soon become extinct because of inbreeding (the population has shrunk to its present size from a high of 115,000 in 1941). But like Iceland, the project could also present a commercial opportunity. In 1999, Iceland's government licensed the genetic information from the national database to deCODE Genetics, a biomedical company that hopes to develop new cures and diagnostic kits. Hoping to do the same for the Parsis, Patell launched the 1.25-billion-rupee (US$30-million) project on 21 March. She plans to create a database that holds genetic data, together with genealogical and medical histories, of at least 50,000 Parsis in five years and eventually of the entire community. Parsis already keep extensive genealogical data, says Patell, and it should be possible to reconstruct their medical records from clinics and hospitals in Mumbai, where more than 90% of Parsis live. The company's genomics and bioinformatics facilities have been upgraded so they can sequence selected markers in the participants' DNA. Avesthagen will provide the initial capital and plans to raise the rest from prosperous sections of the Parsi community and other sources. Patell declines to name potential sources, although Avesthagen already has several international collaborations, including with the French company bioM\u00e9rieux for the development of diagnostic chips, US company Sequenom for the validation of genetic markers for cancers, and European drug giants AstraZeneca and Novartis. Patell says that she has been discussing the project with prominent members of the Parsi community for four years, making the case that the information gained will directly benefit the health of the dwindling population. A council of eminent Parsi figures will manage the project, deciding on matters such as who will own the database and who can access the data. Vasantha Muthuswamy, deputy chief of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), says that the government has no problem with the commercialization of the community's genetic information as long as the ICMR's biobanking guidelines are followed. Among other things, these require informed consent and data confidentiality \u2014 issues that overshadowed Iceland's plans to establish a database for the health sector. \u201cAfter Iceland, this has become a global issue,\u201d Muthuswamy told  Nature . \u201cWe have to see what kind of agreement the Parsi community signs with Avesthagen.\u201d Patell says that the genome analysis will focus on genetic defects common in Parsis, such as a deficiency of G6PD (glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase) \u2014 an enzyme that triggers the sudden destruction of red blood cells. Reduced fertility, ovarian disease, Parkinson's, Alzheimer's and breast cancer are other likely areas of study. But not everyone is convinced that the project will work. Studies suggest that there has been some mixing of Parsi genes with those of other Indians. \u201cIt is a bit of a gamble,\u201d says Indraneel Mittra, director of the Bhopal Memorial Hospital and Research Centre in India. \u201cMy feeling is that the Parsis are not as pure as Icelanders, and in any case I do not know how fruitful the Icelandic study has been.\u201d \n                     First phase of HapMap project already helping drug discovery \n                   \n                     Large genomic differences explain our little quirks \n                   \n                     Icelandic database shelved as court judges privacy in peril \n                   \n                     Broad sweep of genome zeroes in on diabetes \n                   \n                     Medical research news channel \n                   \n                     Avesthagen \n                   \n                     Wikipedia on the Parsi community \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

The best images of the Sun yet obtained are now streaming in \u2014 and they are both illuminating and baffling for scientists. The Hinode spacecraft, an international mission led by the Japanese space agency JAXA, was launched in September 2006, and is now circling Earth in an orbit that gives it a good view of the Sun. The latest data to be sent back from its three main instruments show our star as a dynamic, turbulent, mysterious hothouse of magnetic activity. Researchers have long been puzzled by the observation that the Sun's corona \u2014 the atmosphere of gas that extends out from the Sun at a temperature of millions of degrees Celsius \u2014 is about 100 times hotter than its surface. One possible explanation is that magnetic fields projecting from the Sun twist about in the turbulent environment until they eventually snap, releasing energy as heat. The data being returned by Hinode's X-Ray Telescope add weight to this theory. \u201cWe can see the corona structures twisting and shearing,\u201d says Leon Golub of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge, Massachusetts. \u201cThere are things that look exactly as predicted,\u201d he says. But some of the observations are proving more confusing. Astrophysicists have been stunned by a video image of a magnetic arc collapsing in on itself. \u201cWe are used to seeing magnetic fields emerging outwards,\u201d says Golub.

Golub expects that this, too, may be related to the corona's high temperature, but says that as yet there is no theory to predict this kind of activity. \u201cProcesses that we see on the Sun are not intuitive and not easily explained,\u201d says Alan Title of the Lockheed Martin Advanced Technology Center in Palo Alto, California. Title works on Hinode's third instrument, the Solar Optical Telescope.

Giovanni Bignami , former scientific director of the Italian Space Agency (ASI) and former chair of the European Space Agency's (ESA's) space science advisory committee, was last week nominated as the ASI's next president.  Nature  asks him about his plans at the ASI, Europe's prospects in space and the art of Galileo Galilei. \n               What are Italy's main achievements in space? \n             The most recent success was the 1996\u20132002 Italian\u2013Dutch BeppoSax mission dedicated to \u03b3-ray bursts. A new \u03b3-ray mission, AGILE, will be launched soon. \n               And its weaknesses? \n             New missions have been delayed, and new concepts crushed, by poor administration hindering the flow of contracts to industry and the scientific community. \n               What are your plans at the ASI? \n             We need to have a longer vision. Italy hasn't flown a space mission for more than a decade. I want to bring the ASI back to flying satellite missions, both in science and in a variety of applications. \n               How can Italy live up to its legacy in space? \n             Besides hard work and efficiency, this will require balancing a profound European commitment with exploiting the resources of our scientific community in conjunction with industry. \n               European space research is funded by national agencies such as the ASI, directly and through ESA. Is this mix an obstacle to Europe's competitiveness in space? \n             On the contrary, this is a gift to European nations. Out of the national programmes comes the greater breadth of the European programmes. United we stand, divided we fall. \n               In its 'Cosmic Vision 2015\u20132025', ESA has proposed a set of priorities for European space research. Which of the proposed missions do you consider most important? \n             It is most important that Europe now has a vision for its future in space science, from planets to the origin of the Universe. I do not have a scientific preference. That decision will be taken by Europe's scientists. A call for proposals has already hit the streets. \n               Should Europe join the new 'race to the Moon'? \n             Cum grano salis  [with a grain of salt]. \n               What about Mars? \n             I am a firm supporter of Aurora, ESA's planetary exploration programme. Its immediate aim is the robotic exploration of Mars. This is a great opportunity for Europe. Aurora also considers manned missions to Mars, albeit in the distant future. \n               Space exploration requires strong industrial partners. Is the balance in Europe between commercial interests and basic research needs in order? \n             All space missions are being designed, built and flown by industry. European industry needs political support to meet the challenge that is coming from all over the world, in the fields of launchers, satellite production and ground infrastructure. Basic research and commercial interests both represent challenges that can spur European industry to take a leading role in space. \n               Should Europe reach out for Russia as a partner in space? \n             Russia is already a partner. Imagine a world where Russia joins ESA. This might look difficult now, but it is potentially very interesting. \n               And NASA? \n             Since Italy's very first steps in space more than 40 years ago, it has been collaborating with NASA. I received my space education in the United States, and I will certainly try to increase the quality of the ASI's collaboration with NASA. \n               Which key questions do you think space scientists will answer in the next two decades? \n             Three things spring to mind: the nature and origin of dark matter, the observation of gravitational waves from the Big Bang, and discovering a new 'Earth'. All of them require bold, innovative space technologies, which are already at work in precursor missions such as ESA's Gaia, Planck, Herschel and LISA Pathfinder and the NASA/ESA James Webb Space Telescope. Finding a new Earth, possibly with evidence for life on it, will require the development of new technologies, such as space infrared interferometry. \n               Galileo Galilei has written some very worldly poems, the longest of which you have translated into English. What has the great scientist achieved in art? \n             Galileo's achievements in science were born of his post-Renaissance artistic education. He was a skilled draftsman, musician, and of course had a way with words. The Italian novelist Italo Calvino considered him the greatest writer in Italian literature. I remain fascinated by Galileo's genius. \n                 Interview by Quirin Schiermeier. \n               \n                     A space dilemma: extend missions or start afresh? \n                   \n                     Saving Italian science \n                   \n                     European space scientists brim with ideas for going it alone \n                   \n                     Space and astronomy news \n                   \n                     Italian Space Agency \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

An experimental cancer drug shrinks tumours in rats with no apparent side effects. The scientists behind the study plan to do a clinical trial in humans, but it could take years to complete. Meanwhile, dying patients begin taking the unapproved drug and collect their results on the web. Both groups desperately want to save lives: but which is the right route to follow? This scenario has been playing out in recent weeks for a compound called dichloroacetate (DCA). It taps into long-running issues about whether terminally ill patients should be able to get access to drugs that have not yet had formal approval. Researchers fear that those taking the drug could suffer unanticipated side effects; patients argue they don't have the luxury of waiting for clinical trials to find out. In January this year, Evangelos Michelakis at the University of Alberta in Edmonton, Canada, and his colleagues reported that DCA has seemingly remarkable anticancer properties (S. Bonnet  et al .  Cancer Cell   11 , 37\u201351; 2007). DCA is a small molecule that blocks an enzyme in mitochondria \u2014 the energy-production centres in cells \u2014 causing more glucose to be metabolized in the mitochondria rather than by a different pathway in the cytoplasm. The compound has been in clinical trials for years as a treatment for certain mitochondrial diseases, but it has not yet been approved. Mitochondria also control cell suicide, and Michelakis wondered whether cancer cells were suppressing these cellular structures to prevent the cells from dying \u2014 and so thought DCA might reactivate them. When his team gave DCA to rats that were growing human lung tumours, the tumours stopped growing within a week, and three months later were half the size of those in untreated animals. Other experimental drugs have had similar effects. But DCA stands out because it seems to leave healthy cells untouched, has been relatively safe in human trials, can be taken by mouth and easily penetrates tissues. \u201cIf there were a magic bullet,\u201d wrote  Newsweek  about the discovery, \u201cit might be something like dichloroacetate.\u201d Because DCA has been around for years, its structure can't be patented and Michelakis found that pharmaceutical companies weren't interested in developing the drug. So he is raising money and hopes to start his own small clinical trial within the next few months. In the meantime Jim Tassano, who owns a pest-control and marketing company in Sonora, California, came across DCA when researching alternative cancer therapies to help his dying ballroom-dance instructor. He wanted something that was effective, safe and that he could lay his hands on: DCA fit the bill. He ordered some from chemical supply companies, teamed up with a chemist friend and they worked out a way to synthesize the compound themselves. \u201cI couldn't walk away from it,\u201d Tassano says. \u201cIt could do so much good for so many people.\u201d Tassano set up two websites. The first of these (thedcasite.com) hosts information on DCA and a patient chatroom. On the second (buydca.com) Tassano is selling his home-made DCA \u2014 labelled for veterinary use, as drugs sold for human use in the United States must have approval from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Tassano says he is sure patients are buying the drug to use on themselves, and reckons that a couple of hundred of people from around the world have bought from the site. Many patients taking DCA \u2014 acquired from Tassano, chemical companies or other sources \u2014 are reporting their progress on thedcasite.com. Some of these patients plan to set up a database on Tassano's website to collect DCA results in a more organized way. They want people to submit information including the type of cancer they suffer, medical history and the dose they are taking, says Susan Hirasawa in Seattle, Washington, who suffers from late-stage breast cancer and is one of the organizers. The idea is to provide information for others who want to take DCA, she says, but \u201cit's not a real clinical trial\u201d. Michelakis and other researchers are worried by the development. Although DCA seems safe overall, they point to a clinical trial that was stopped early because those taking the drug developed damage to their peripheral nerves (P. Kaufmann  et al .  Neurology   66 , 324\u2013330; 2006). Without a control group, they point out, it will be impossible to tell whether any improvement in the patients' condition is caused by the drug. Patients could also be taking DCA that is not of pharmaceutical grade and might contain harmful impurities. Michelakis says the patients could end up undermining efforts to do a controlled clinical trial if, for example, some develop harmful side effects and the drug earns a bad reputation. \u201cIt's destroying efforts to do this right,\u201d he says. \u201cAny way you look at this, it's a negative development.\u201d An FDA spokesperson told  Nature  that the agency is looking into the matter. The battle between dying patients who want immediate access to unapproved drugs and doctors who urge trials and caution is a perennial one. Some patients argue that they cannot wait for trials and should have the right to take unapproved drugs, regardless of the risks. But there are arguments against this. An estimated 95% of cancer drugs that enter clinical trials do not get approval, many because they are ineffective or unsafe, so patients risk shortening their life or making their last days more uncomfortable. \u201cThey say what do I have to lose? The truth of the matter is, you have the rest of your life to lose,\u201d says George Annas, an expert in bioethics at Boston University School of Public Health. And if patients can access DCA \u2014 or other unapproved drugs \u2014 there is no incentive for them to enter a clinical trial. So in terms of public health, ethicists argue, more people will be helped if access to unapproved drugs is restricted and proper trials performed. Peter Jacobsen, an expert in ethics, health and law at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, doubts whether any good can come of the patients' efforts. They are so desperate to see results, he says, that there is no way they can report unbiased results and no mechanism to ensure the reports are accurate. \u201cI don't trust the data,\u201d he says. \u201cIt's hard enough to rely on them in clinical trials, let alone this.\u201d \n                     US proposal to expand access to untested drugs draws fire \n                   \n                     Premature medication \n                   \n                     News Feature: Bad medicine \n                   \n                     DCA research information \n                   \n                     FDA \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

The US Congress has asked Purdue University for reports of its inquiries into allegations against nuclear engineer Rusi Taleyarkhan. The request is one of the first actions from the House subcommittee on Investigations and Oversight, which was re-established in January 2007 when the Democrats took control of the US House of Representatives after twelve years of Republican majority. The move suggests that Congress is preparing to take a more active role in investigating the way that publicly funded research is policed. Taleyarkhan has published several controversial papers claiming that he can trigger the energy-releasing process of fusion by passing ultrasound through deuterated liquids \u2014 a phenomenon known as bubble fusion. In February, Purdue issued a statement saying that Taleyarkhan had been cleared of internal allegations of research misconduct. But critics have questioned how the finding was reached, and asked why the university's administration failed to say whether the fraud allegations it had received were considered (see  Nature   445 , 690\u2013691; 2007). Now, Representative Brad Miller (Democrat, North Carolina), the chairman of the oversight subcommittee, is seeking clarification. In a letter sent to Purdue's president Martin Jischke last week, Miller asked that two copies of the university's internal inquiry reports on the allegations be delivered to the subcommittee by 30 March. He says that Congress expects universities that receive federal funds to investigate when questions are raised about the integrity of research. \u201cIt was about whether they were policing the research correctly,\u201d he told  Nature . Purdue, which is based in West Lafayette, Indiana, has held two inquiries into Taleyarkhan's research. The first, which followed a report on questions about Taleyarkhan's work in  Nature (see doi:10.1038/news060306-1; 2006 ), was announced by the university's provost Sally Mason in March 2006, and finished in June 2006. Its findings were kept confidential, but the subcommittee believes that it recommended a full-scale investigation into Taleyarkhan that never took place. A second inquiry cleared Taleyarkhan in February this year, but it is unclear why the two inquiries reached different conclusions. A congressional staff member who is familiar with the subcommittee's interest says that it would be a concern if the university had found procedural reasons to restrict the allegations or evidence that were available to an inquiry. \u201cThe university intends to comply fully with the committee's request. In doing so, we must attend to certain legal obligations under our own policy,\u201d Purdue has said in a statement. \u201cIt is very rare for Congress to intervene in such matters,\u201d says Mark Frankel, director of the Scientific Freedom, Responsibility and Law Program at the American Association for the Advancement of Science in Washington DC. Between 1981 and 1995, when it was disbanded by the Republicans, the subcommittee has taken an interest in cases of alleged or actual research misconduct. These included the highly publicized and controversial hearings on allegations against Thereza Imanishi-Kari, a biologist working at Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge with the Nobel laureate David Baltimore in the late 1980s. Imanishi-Kari was later exonerated. Since then, Congress has mostly deferred to the agencies that fund research to oversee institutional processes. Frankel is not persuaded that Congress now needs to take a more active approach. Miller emphasizes that the current focus is on learning more about how Purdue handled the allegations rather than assessing the research itself. Taleyarkhan's research has been funded by the State of Indiana, the Department of Energy through Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee, where he previously worked, and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). The inspector-general of the Office of Naval Research, which administers some DARPA grants, is conducting an inquiry into allegations against bubble-fusion research concurrent with the congressional probe.

But do they deserve these credentials? Jim Giles reports. As debate rages in the United States over whether intelligent design should be taught in science classes, another topic that many researchers see as a pseudoscience is claiming scientific status within the British education system. Over the past decade, several British universities have started offering bachelor of science (BSc) degrees in alternative medicine, including six that offer BSc degrees in homeopathy, a therapy in which the active ingredient is diluted so much that the dose given to the patient often does not contain even a single molecule of it. Some scientists are increasingly concerned that such courses give homeopathy and homeopaths undeserved scientific credibility, and they are campaigning to get the label removed (see Commentary,  page 373 ). Many scientists and advocates of evidence-based medicine feel that giving homeopathy scientific status is unjustified. Aside from the fact that there is no known mechanism by which this treatment could work, they argue that the evidence against it is conclusive. Of the many rigorous systematic reviews conducted in the past decade, only a handful have produced evidence, marginal at best, in favour of homeopathy, with the authors in each case stating that the data were weak. Several reviewers found no effect, and a prominent study suggesting that homeopathy does work (L. Linde  et al .  Lancet   350 , 834\u2013843; 1997), and which is frequently cited by homeopaths, has had its methodology extensively criticized since publication. But homeopaths involved in the university courses \u2014 those that were willing to speak to  Nature , at least \u2014 argue that they teach students scientific principles, including the critical analysis of evidence. Finding out exactly what is taught in the courses is not straightforward. Ben Goldacre, a London-based medical doctor, journalist and frequent critic of homeopathy, says that several universities have refused to let him see their course materials. \u201cI can't imagine what they're teaching,\u201d he says. \u201cI can only imagine that they teach that it's OK to cherry-pick evidence. That's totally unacceptable.\u201d Pharmacologist David Colquhoun of University College London has had the same problem, and is now using freedom-of-information legislation to get access to course materials after having numerous requests refused. The University of Central Lancashire and the University of Salford both declined requests to talk to  Nature  or share details of their homeopathy degrees. One university that is willing to discuss its teaching is the University of Westminster in London. Brian Isbell, head of Westminster's department of complementary therapies, defends the BSc description, arguing that as with all of the university's complementary therapy degrees, students also have to study the health-sciences model of disease, so that they can \u201cwork safely and effectively within the healthcare system\u201d. Students are required to do research and produce critiques of the literature. Reading lists include papers from sources such as  Homeopathy , a journal published by the Faculty of Homeopathy, a members' association for professional homeopaths based in Luton. But the lists also include recent studies that are critical of homeopathy and conventional guides to doing and evaluating healthcare research. One assignment asks students to critique a paper that assessed the health changes reported by patients suffering from a range of chronic diseases when they attended follow-up appointments after receiving homeopathic treatment at a hospital in Bristol. Almost three-quarters of the 6,500 patients reported that their condition had improved (D. S. Spence  et al .  The Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine   11,  793\u2013798; 2005). The paper generated significant media coverage when it was published, but its methodology has been widely criticized. No control group was used, prompting Colquhoun to note that the study is not even capable of showing that homeopathy was producing a placebo effect. So what happens when students critique the paper? Do they get full marks for showing that it provides no evidence at all for homeopathy? Not quite, says Isbell, who says the paper was chosen precisely because of the controversy over its methodology. Students would be expected to discuss the problems with the lack of controls and to suggest ways to run better studies. But Isbell says that the Bristol researchers still collected useful 'outcome measures' \u2014 basically a set of reports from individual patients about how they improved. \u201cIt doesn't have the rigour of other methods,\u201d Isbell says, \u201cbut it is part of the picture.\u201d The differing opinions over the paper highlight an issue at the centre of the dispute about the evidence for homeopathy, and which explains in part why lecturers feel they can teach the subject as science. For advocates of evidence-based medicine, the double-blind randomized clinical trial (in which neither the doctor nor the patient knows who is getting active treatment and who is getting a placebo) is the best form of evidence available to practitioners. When regulators take decisions on drug safety, for example, they usually rely on such studies. But for homeopaths, there is a serious flaw in this approach. When a patient visits a homeopath, the practitioner asks questions that go beyond the symptoms and probe other aspects of the patient's life, such as whether they are feeling stressed or unhappy. The result is an individualized treatment that takes longer than the ten or so minutes that the patient would get with a government-funded family doctor. This personal interaction is critical to homeopathy, both in tailoring the medicine and in gaining the patient's confidence. Homeopaths say that if there is a chance that the patient might receive a placebo at the end of it, the necessary trust can break down. \u201cTrying to do what I do in that context didn't work very well,\u201d says Clare Relton, a practising homeopath who is conducting research into homeopathy at the University of Sheffield and has taken part in a clinical trial designed to assess homeopathic treatments for chronic fatigue syndrome. \u201cI found it difficult to build a therapeutic relationship,\u201d she says. Relton argues that homeopathy is scientific, but that the problem of trust means that double-blind trials aren't the best way to measure its effectiveness. Instead, she and other homeopaths prefer to rely on more qualitative methods, such as case studies and non-blinded comparisons of treatment options. These, they say, provide ample evidence that homeopathy works. Similar attitudes to homeopathic teaching are evident outside Britain. \u201cI definitely think homeopathy can, and should, be evaluated within the context of double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trials,\u201d says Ellen Hughes, who teaches complementary therapies to medical students at the University of California, San Francisco. She concedes, however, that the emphasis homeopaths place on individually tailored treatment makes designing such trials \u201ca bit of a challenge\u201d. For advocates of evidence-based medicine, such arguments are equivalent to admitting that homeopathy is nothing more than a strong placebo effect brought on by an attentive practitioner. If the treatment cannot work unless the patient and practitioner believe in it, then it cannot be due to the physical properties of the remedy. Homeopaths disagree, insisting that the remedy itself does have an effect independent of the practitioner. But by ruling out what scientists consider the best mechanism available to test this assertion, it is hard to see how homeopaths will ever convince their opponents. So where does this leave scientific opposition to homeopathy degrees? Outside Britain, even in France and Germany where homeopathy is relatively popular, the topic is taught in universities only as a small part of a medical degree and is not classed as a science \u2014 a compromise that most academics seem happy with. But in Britain, the number of BSc degrees in alternative medicine has grown over the past decade. They are generally run by 'new' universities \u2014 institutions that emphasize vocational rather than academic training, but have been given university status over the past 15 years as part of the government's drive to provide equal opportunities for higher education. Alternative medicine is not the only surprising subject to be classified as science, but Colquhoun and Goldacre argue that degrees in complementary medicine are particularly harmful because they lead patients to believe that they are being treated by a scientifically trained practitioner. The critics seem to have little chance of getting the BSc label removed from these courses any time soon. The few organizations that could pressure universities to reclassify the courses have little interest in the debate. Universities UK, the body that represents the country's higher-education institutes, says that it has not discussed the matter and that decisions about how to describe courses are up to the individual universities. The Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Education, the body charged with safeguarding academic standards, also says that it does not get involved in questions about what constitutes science, and that universities are entitled to set their own courses. So  Nature  contacted the universities of Westminster, Central Lancashire and Salford for an official response from the institution on whether they think the BSc tag is justified for their homeopathy courses. All declined to comment. \n                 Additional reporting by Declan Butler, Michael Hopkin, Katharine Sanderson and Sophie Sigler. \n               \n                     The memory of water \n                   \n                     Disgruntled homeopathists seek remedy in court \n                   \n                     David Colquhoun's Improbable Science page \n                   \n                     Ben Goldacre's Bad Science blog \n                   \n                     University of Westminster's homeopathy course \n                   \n                     Clare Relton's page at University of Sheffiel \n                   \n                     Bristol paper on outcome measures \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Tokyo Japanese paediatricians are studying whether Tamiflu, the drug widely thought to be our best defence against avian flu, might be causing mental instability and suicidal tendencies. An initial study cleared Tamiflu of any link, but that study, as well as a larger one that has just started, are raising concerns about conflicts of interest, as some of the researchers have received large sums of money from the drug's Japanese distributor. Countries around the world have been stockpiling Tamiflu (oseltamivir) since 2004, in case of a pandemic of avian flu. Japan is by far the biggest user of the drug: in 2005, Japanese doctors wrote 9 million prescriptions for Tamiflu, compared with 3 million for all other countries combined. But concerns about the drug's safety, which is made by Roche, have been growing after some unusual deaths in Japanese teenagers who had taken it. Most recently, a 14-year-old girl and a 14-year-old boy died when they jumped from apartment buildings on 16 and 27 February, respectively. Tokyo-based Chugai Pharmaceuticals, which distributes the drug in Japan, says that it has reported 289 cases of psychoneurotic effects, including three suspicious deaths, to the Japanese health ministry since the drug was launched there in 2001. Chugai now lists the possibility of severe neurological side effects on the drug's labelling and has distributed a warning note to hospitals. The Japanese health ministry insists that there is no clear evidence of a link, however, and points out that flu itself can cause symptoms such as abnormal behaviour. Roche agrees, adding that the number of suspicious deaths is tiny compared to the number of people who have been prescribed the drug. Tamiflu was cleared initially when seven paediatricians and a statistician looked at the side effects of it and other influenza drugs, as well as at the symptoms of flu itself. The study, which ended in February 2006, followed up 2,846 children aged mostly ten or younger who had been diagnosed with flu. The frequency of abnormal behaviour in children who took Tamiflu was 11.9%, compared with 10.6% in those who didn't take it, which the researchers concluded was not a significant difference. Shunpei Yokota, head of the study group and a paediatrician at Yokohama City University's Graduate School of Medicine, admits that the study had shortcomings, including a poor definition for the term 'abnormal behaviour'. So in February, at the government's request, Yokota's team launched a larger study, which will trace 10,000 people aged 0\u201318 years. The team aims to release the results by this autumn. But Yokota's team has itself come under fire recently. Last week, it emerged that Chugai paid for paediatric research and teaching by at least two members of the study group, including Yokota, and Tsuneo Morishima of Okayama University. Chugai gave ten million yen (around US$ 85,000) to Yokota between 2001 and 2006 and two million yen to Morishima in 2005, prompting criticisms that the researchers had a conflict of interest. \u201cIt's quite natural for the public to imagine any interest may have been involved,\u201d says Masayuki Shibuya, vice-president at Tokushima University, which has developed model guidelines to manage conflicts of interest in clinical research. Morishima, Yokota and their universities have defended the donations, saying that all funding was approved by the university, and that the money was used for unrelated work and so did not affect the results of the flu study. Tamaki Fushimi, head of drug safety at the Japanese health ministry, says that the ministry was not aware of the funding when it appointed the study group, and that it has not yet decided whether to allow those who received money from Chugai to continue with the study. Masanori Fukushima, professor of clinical-trial design and management at the Kyoto University Graduate School of Medicine, is one of those who think that the researchers should be removed. \u201cThe ministry should care about ethical and regulatory issues more properly,\u201d he says. But Yokota insists he has done nothing wrong. \u201cTamiflu is an important drug, but we have no standards to tell doctors who can be prescribed it and who can't,\u201d he says. \u201cIt is our responsibility as paediatricians to create this measurement.\u201d \n                     Controlling immune response may cut bird flu death rate \n                   \n                     Chink found in flu virus enzymes \n                   \n                     Wartime tactic doubles power of scarce bird-flu drug \n                   \n                     Avian flu special: What's in the medicine cabinet? \n                   \n                     Avian flu Web focus \n                   \n                     Bird flu in focus \n                   \n                     Tamiflu information \n                   \n                     Roche \n                   \n                     FDA safety alerts for Tamiflu \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

On 21 March \u2014 the spring equinox \u2014 something very strange may have happened. In two particular places on Earth, objects might have started to move without any force acting on them. Such motion would violate Newton's second law, a fundamental principle of mechanics, which states that objects accelerate by an amount proportional to the force acting on them. But it needn't involve anything paranormal. According to Alexander Ignatiev of the University of Melbourne in Australia, this weird phenomenon would be proof of a new kind of mechanics called modified newtonian dynamics (MOND). First suggested in 1983 by Israeli physicist Moti Milgrom, MOND aims to provide an alternative to dark matter, the invisible and so far unidentified stuff invoked by physicists to explain why rotating galaxies don't fall apart. MOND is very speculative, but interest in it has been boosted in recent years by the observation that the Pioneer 10 and 11 spacecraft, launched in the early 1970s to study the planets, seem to be veering from their expected paths as they leave the Solar System. No one knows whether the anomaly is real or just the result of faulty observations of the spacecraft's motion. Finding evidence for MOND would be hugely important: \u201cThe foundations of physics would have to be revised,\u201d says Ignatiev. But measuring the predicted deviations from Newton's theory is extremely difficult. MOND diverges from newtonian dynamics only at very small accelerations, around a hundred trillionths of a metre per second per second. At this rate, an object that began to move when Newton published his second law in 1687 would now be travelling at one metre per second. To check out the theory, Ignatiev says, you need a test object moving with an acceleration small enough (relative to the rest of the Galaxy) for MOND effects to be apparent. Even if an object sits motionless on a lab bench, it is generally accelerating with respect to the Galaxy because of Earth's rotation and orbit around the Sun, and the Sun's motion in space. But Ignatiev's calculations have shown that at a particular moment each year, at two points on Earth, these accelerations cancel out for about half a millisecond. This, he calculates, coincides with either the spring or autumn equinox (A. Yu. Ignatiev  Phys. Rev. Lett.   98,  101101; 2007). The points of cancellation are always at latitudes 79\u00b0 50\u2032 above and below the Equator, whereas the longitude varies each year. This spring they will be at 178\u00b0 E, high above Siberia in the Arctic Sea and on the Ross Ice Shelf of Antarctica. The autumn equinox of 2008 will be a little more amenable to experimenters, when the northern point is in Greenland. Ignatiev cautions, however, that these are approximate locations, and ignore the subtle effects of the Moon and planets. Before you make the journey, he says, you had better do the full calculation, as the effect acts over an area just a few centimetres across. So what might you hope to see? As external acceleration effects cancel out, says Ignatiev, the object's acceleration would fall below the MOND threshold \u2014 and if the theory is correct, it will spontaneously jump over a small distance. The predicted jump is tiny: about 0.2\u00d710 \u221216  metres, or one- fiftieth of the diameter of a proton. But Ignatiev reckons it could be measured by interferometry, which detects minute differences in the path lengths of light beams. The technique is being developed in huge instruments for detecting gravitational waves, which are predicted to alter the dimensions of space very slightly as they pass. Gravitational-wave detectors typically involve light corridors several kilometres long. But there are now other types of detector that are more portable, and which it might be possible to carry to Antarctica or Greenland. The MiniGRAIL detector being developed at Leiden University in the Netherlands, for example, is a metal ball 68 centimetres in diameter. Others in the field are sceptical about Ignatiev's chances. Orfeu Bertolami, a physicist at the Instituto Superior T\u00e9cnico in Lisbon, says that although the proposal is \u201ca brave attempt\u201d to suggest how MOND could be tested, he is not convinced it would work. He points out that Ignatiev used newtonian mechanics to calculate the points of zero acceleration, and that these rules wouldn't necessarily apply in the MOND world he wants to test. Even if the theory works, Bertolami doubts it would be possible to observe exact cancellation of acceleration. A medium-sized iceberg passing 10 kilometres away in the Antarctic or Arctic Ocean, he says, would induce a gravitational acceleration comparable to the MOND threshold. And the MOND hypothesis itself is looking decidedly shaky, because there is now rather good evidence that dark matter, which MOND attempts to eliminate, does exist. Last year, a galaxy cluster was found to have an asymmetrical distribution of visible matter that could only easily be explained if it was balanced by dark matter (see  Nature doi:10.1038/news060821-6; 2006 ). After this, says Bertolami, \u201cany attempt to force MOND on us is difficult to swallow\u201d. But Ignatiev argues that the debate is far from settled. \u201cExperimental searches for dark matter are conducted in many laboratories across the world,\u201d he says. \u201cMOND should be given the same chance.\u201d \n                     Quantum gravity: Back to the future \n                   \n                     Following in Pioneer's footsteps \n                   \n                     Support sought to investigate sluggish Pioneers \n                   \n                     Physical sciences news channel \n                   \n                     Ignatieff's paper \n                   \n                     MOND \n                   \n                     Pioneer anomaly \n                   \n                     Mystery Spot \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Earlier this month, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) cautioned Americans that two classes of drugs in widespread use have serious and sometimes life-threatening side effects that warrant new label warnings. On 9 March, the agency announced that three erythropoietin-type drugs for treating anaemia increase the risk of death, blood clots, strokes and heart attacks, and accelerate the growth of some cancers. Then on 14 March, it asked makers of 13 widely prescribed sedative-hypnotic sleeping pills to toughen label warnings because of reported severe allergic reactions and \u201ccomplex sleep-related behaviours\u201d, including falling asleep while driving. These warnings, for blockbuster drugs that have been on the market for years, highlight an increasing challenge that confronts the FDA. Side effects may not emerge until new drugs are taken by huge numbers of people. This lesson was driven home by the anti-inflammatory drug Vioxx, which was withdrawn in 2004 after five years on the market, for causing heart attacks and strokes. As a greying America consumes an ever-expanding smorgasbord of medicines, the agency is fighting an uphill battle to catch the next Vioxx before it turns into a fully fledged disaster. So experts are calling for the FDA to move beyond its current passive system for monitoring the safety of marketed drugs. The Adverse Event Reporting System relies on doctors \u2014 if and when it occurs to them \u2014 to report suspected side effects to the agency. But doctors filed fewer than 25,000 such reports in 2005, suggesting that the system is capturing only a small fraction of the actual side effects. \u201cThe system in this country for identifying drug safety signals is not nearly as robust as it could be,\u201d says Scott Gottlieb, resident fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative Washington think-tank, and a former deputy commissioner for medical and scientific affairs at the FDA. Last week, Mark McClellan, a former FDA commissioner, told a Senate committee considering new drug-safety legislation that the system \u201cneeds to do better than just seeing the tip of the iceberg of a safety problem after it has already hit us\u201d. Health-information technology for drug safety is \u201can idea whose time has come\u201d, he added. McClellan and others are pushing the idea of data mining of existing health-record databases as an active surveillance system to pick up early warnings of adverse side effects. By pooling existing databases run by private insurance plans, government agencies and industry, information on well over 100 million people could be studied in something much closer to real time, he says. The FDA could then identify priority questions and the mechanisms for answering them. If such a system had been in place when Vioxx came on the market in 1999, that drug's dangers could have been detected in months rather than years, McClellan contends. The same thinking is gaining currency in Europe. \u201cThere is great potential in the use of these healthcare databases,\u201d says Panos Tsintis, who oversees the safety of marketed drugs for the European Medicines Agency (EMEA) in London. Drug makers are also backing the idea of a centralized active surveillance system, which they see as preferable to a duplication of effort in which each insurer, government agency and company invents its own scheme. Such a system \u201cwould provide information we crucially currently don't have\u201d, said Ron Krall, senior vice-president and chief medical officer for GlaxoSmithKline at an Institute of Medicine (IOM) forum on 12 March in Washington DC. The FDA is testing active surveillance in a pilot programme tracking the side effects of four unnamed, newly approved medicines. \u201cIn general, safety information trickles in and the FDA is passive in analysing it,\u201d said Ellis Unger, an official from the agency's drug-review centre, at the IOM forum. \u201cIn this programme we grab each new product by the horns. It's very resource-intensive.\u201d Those costs present a major problem to the cash-strapped agency, which has no funds even to upgrade its existing surveillance system. But advocates of active surveillance say the country cannot afford not to invest what would probably be tens of millions of dollars. That kind of money, says Garret FitzGerald, head of pharmacology at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, \u201cis peanuts when you think about the public health\u201d. \n                     Troubling reports tarnish credibility of US drug agency \n                   \n                     How does a painkiller harm the heart? \n                   \n                     Drug safety special: The safety catch \n                   \n                     NPG Drug discovery index \n                   \n                     FDA press release on sleeping pills \n                   \n                     FDA press release on anaemia drugs \n                   \n                     Institute of Medicine forum \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

The US government is considering a massive plan to store almost all scientific data generated by federal agencies in publicly accessible digital repositories. The aim is for the kind of data access and sharing currently enjoyed by genome researchers via GenBank, or astronomers via the National Virtual Observatory, but for the whole of US science. Scientists would then be able to access data from any federal agency and integrate it into their studies. For example, a researcher browsing an online journal article on the spread of a disease could not only pull up the underlying data, but mesh them with information from databases on agricultural land use, weather and genetic sequences. Nature  has learned that a draft strategic plan will be drawn up by next autumn by a new Interagency Working Group on Digital Data (IWGDD). It represents 22 agencies, including the National Science Foundation (NSF), NASA, the Departments of Energy, Agriculture, and Health and Human Services, and other government branches including the Office of Science and Technology Policy. The group's first step is to set up a robust public infrastructure so all researchers have a permanent home for their data. One option is to create a national network of online data repositories, funded by the government and staffed by dedicated computing and archiving professionals. It would extend to all communities a model similar to the Arabidopsis Information Resource, in which 20 staff serve 13,000 registered users and 5,000 labs. The group then aims to help scientific communities create standards to let databases in one field talk to others in different disciplines. That will be no mean feat. Even scientists in highly organized 'big science' fields such as genomics and astronomy, who routinely work with large shared data sets, encounter problems when trying to carry out sophisticated calculations using data from different communities. For example, it is still a huge task to mash together astronomical observations of the same object taken at different wavelengths and stored in different databases, says Giuseppina Fabbiano of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, the Smithsonian's representative on the IWGDD. \u201cWe still cannot extract data from different archives and put it together seamlessly.\u201d Agreeing standards even within closely linked communities \u201cis like Middle-East peacekeeping \u2014 every detail has to be worked out and agreed on,\u201d adds her colleague at the centre, Martin Elvis. Many researchers are reluctant to share their raw data in the first place. The IWGDD is considering making submission of well-documented data sets to archives a requirement of getting a grant. Christopher Greer, senior adviser for digital data at the NSF's Office of Cyberinfrastructure, says that if and when all federally supported science data are accessible, he hopes that publishers and computing companies will add on more sophisticated information services. This would give researchers unprecedented ability to test their ideas: \u201cThe next web browser could be a visualization and data-navigation tool, and the next Google an information integrator.\u201d \n                     Data sharing: the next generation \n                   \n                     Mashups mix data into global service \n                   \n                     Let data speak to data \n                   \n                     Science in the web age: Joint efforts \n                   \n                     Google makes data free for all \n                   \n                     National Science Board report on data collections in the 21st century \n                   \n                     NSF Office of Cyberinfrastructure \n                   \n                     NSF 2006 draft report on cyberinfrastructure in the 21st century \n                   \n                     Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},
{"file_id": "446355a", "url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/446355a", "year": 2007, "authors": [{"name": "Kerri Smith"}], "parsed_as_year": "2006_or_before", "body": "A 'brain-activity' test for patients in a vegetative state has divided neurologists. Can brain-injured patients who show no response to their surroundings ever be considered conscious? This question became a hot topic last year after researchers who scanned the brain of a woman diagnosed as being in a vegetative state found that she could perform certain mental tasks on request. The same team has now validated its scanning method on healthy volunteers, and believe that it can be used as a general method for measuring consciousness in unresponsive patients. The researchers are also using real-time brain scanning to try to ask questions of patients who pass the test. Given that there is no consensus about what it even means to be conscious, it is perhaps not surprising that it is difficult to find an objective way of detecting any trace of it in patients in a vegetative state. A test is needed, nevertheless, says Steven Laureys, a team member at the University of Li\u00e8ge in Belgium. Some signs of consciousness have been found in up to 40% of patients in an apparent vegetative state when they are studied more closely, suggesting that such patients are often misdiagnosed. In the high-profile case reported in  Science  last year, the team, led by Adrian Owen of the MRC Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit in Cambridge, UK, used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to show that a woman left in a vegetative state after a car accident could respond to requests to imagine playing tennis or navigate around her house (A. Owen  et al .  Science   313 , 1402; 2006). The team has now tested this technique on 24 healthy volunteers, who were similarly instructed to imagine either walking around their house or playing tennis. The tasks activate separate networks in the brain, and the scans proved able to tell correctly which task was being performed (M. Boly  et al .  NeuroImage  doi:10.1016/j.neuroimage.2007.02.047; 2007). The researchers say that showing that the method works reliably in healthy brains proves its robustness. \u201cOur challenge is to find markers that tell us 'this is a hopeless case' or 'this is a case where we should increase our therapeutic efforts',\u201d says Laureys. Laureys has since used the technique in five vegetative-state patients in Li\u00e8ge, but none has shown brain activity compatible with consciousness. Owen has tried with three patients in Cambridge \u2014 and found one man capable of responding. His team went on to try two-way communication with this patient and with the girl originally described in  Science , using real-time brain scanning. The patients were instructed that to answer 'yes' to a question they should imagine playing tennis (or football \u2014 the team knew the man was an avid Liverpool fan), and for 'no' to imagine walking around their house. This is considerably more complex than the original task and neither patient has responded, but Owen is confident that some patients will be capable of doing so. \u201cIt's probably only a matter of time,\u201d he says. Because doing fMRI scanning requires transporting patients to a hospital that has a scanner, Owen is also investigating the idea of fitting patients with electroencephalogram (EEG) caps that would measure their brainwaves and use this activity to move a cursor around a computer screen. Patients who passed the initial fMRI test could then be extensively followed up using EEG. Not everyone is convinced that the test is ready for diagnostic use. Even if patients do not respond, cautions Nicholas Schiff, a neurologist at Weill Cornell Medical College in New York, it is still not possible to tell exactly what this means. Does the patient understand the question? Do they not want to respond? \u201cThis is not ready for primetime,\u201d says Schiff. \n                     'Vegetative' patient shows signs of conscious thought \n                   \n                     Flickers of consciousness \n                   \n                     Thoughts of woman in 'waking coma' revealed \n                   \n                     'Miracle recovery' shows brain's resilience \n                   \n                     Brain and Behaviour news \n                   \n                     Medical Research news channel \n                   \n                     MRC Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit \n                   \n                     Coma Science Group, University of Li\u00e8ge \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

But will all the money actually move the field forward? Erika Check reports. Gregory Kovacs has had no shortage of stimulating work. An engineer at Stanford University who makes biosensors, Kovacs serves as a regular adviser to the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. He helped investigate the 2003  Columbia  space-shuttle accident. And he climbed the 6,000-metre Licancabur volcano in Chile in the name of medical research \u2014 twice. One thing Kovacs hasn't tried is stem-cell research. But that's about to change. Last month, Kovacs became one of 72 researchers from other fields who have been enticed to work on human embryonic stem cells. All were lured by grants from the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine (CIRM), the state initiative approved by voters in 2004 to overcome federal restrictions on such research. Kovacs, for his part, intends to use his $634,000 grant to study the electrical development of heart stem cells. And he doesn't seem fazed at entering one of the most controversial fields of science, and one in which he has little experience: \u201cAt Stanford, you're parking your car next to some Nobel laureate who knows how to work with stem cells,\u201d he says. \u201cWe can get help.\u201d Kovacs will have even more company on 16 March, when the CIRM hands out further grants worth up to $80 million, this time to established scientists who are already experts in stem-cell research. But it is perhaps more intriguing to look at the initial round of money given to new investigators, the SEED (Scientific Excellence through Exploration and Development) grants. They constitute a rare experiment: to discover whether $45 million and a fresh cast of researchers can affect the future of one of science's hottest fields. The answer begins with the SEED awardees themselves, who span the gamut from wet-behind-the-ears assistant professors to established scientists with sterling reputations. Twenty-seven of the SEED grants went to scientists who have been working independently for six years or less. Other grants went to highly experienced investigators \u2014 even institute directors (see  'Staking it all on stem cells' ). The researchers approached the CIRM for a variety of reasons, including the exhilaration of entering a cutting-edge discipline and the opportunity to extend their work into a new system. Another oft-cited factor is the tight budgets at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the major public funder of US biology research. \u201cIn these times of greatly diminished NIH funding, it is fantastic to have a forward-thinking programme such as the CIRM that has stepped up to fill the void,\u201d says Warner Greene, a veteran HIV researcher who directs the Gladstone Institute of Virology and Immunology at the University of California, San Francisco. This year, the NIH will fund $37 million in human embryonic stem-cell research, but California researchers such as Greene see their future with the CIRM. Greene received a SEED grant for $778,000 to study how proteins that protect cells against HIV might also help human embryonic stem cells maintain stable genomes. The typical SEED grant handed out is between $300,000 and $800,000 for two years \u2014 roughly comparable to the NIH R01, the typical biologist's bread-and-butter grant. The money from the CIRM is not enough to redirect the entire focus of a laboratory. But it does seem to have been enough to encourage scientists to overcome reservations about a field that is notorious for the difficulties involved, including restrictions on federal funding and the inherent challenges of working with cells that are extremely hard to deal with. \u201cWithout CIRM funding, I wouldn't have gotten into this, given the barriers involved,\u201d says Anirvan Ghosh of the University of California, San Diego, a leading developmental neurobiologist. Ghosh received $612,000 for work to try to make brain cells from human embryonic stem cells. \u201cThe CIRM lowered those barriers enough to give me the motivation to write up a proposal,\u201d Ghosh says. Given the grantees' inexperience with stem cells, others may question how serious they are about staying in the field for the long term. But outgoing CIRM president Zach Hall says the agency's review process weeded out those who were only looking for quick cash. \u201cWe had 231 applications, and I'm sure among them there were those whose motivation was primarily to get some money to support their lab,\u201d he says. \u201cBut the quality of people that we funded is extraordinary.\u201d Now the difficult work begins, as researchers confront the day-to-day realities of working with human embryonic stem cells. First, there's the challenge of just obtaining the cells. Researchers receiving federal funding must, by presidential directive, work only on particular stem-cell lines created before August 2001. Many researchers prefer to work on newer lines, which are seen as more reliable and better characterized, but to do so they must use private sources of funding. Many of the scientists who received SEED grants don't yet have labs funded by non-federal money, and so can work only on the 21 designated lines. \u201cThe first thing we'll do is get the NIH-approved lines, and even that takes time,\u201d says David Feldheim, an assistant professor of biology at the University of California, Santa Cruz. Feldheim got $500,000 from the CIRM to study a family of signalling proteins that may affect the development of human embryonic stem cells. But even those scientists lucky enough to be at a university with a privately funded lab still face issues working with CIRM funding. For instance, Ghosh intends to use his money to study cell lines not approved for NIH support. But it's still unclear whether he can perform part of the analysis using instruments at his university that were built with federal money, such as mass spectrometers. \u201cThere are still grey areas, and on the day-to-day issues there is still some hassle,\u201d he says. And although there is plenty of excitement over the first round of SEED grants, others caution against hoping for too much. The patient advocates who helped convince voters to approve the CIRM believe that it will lead to life-saving cures. But veteran researchers have seen high hopes deflated in other fields many times before. For instance, Stanford University biologist Mark Kay has seen hype lead to disillusionment in the controversial area of gene therapy. Kay received a $640,000 SEED grant to study ways to genetically modify human embryonic stem cells. But he worries that the stem-cell field is even more vulnerable to dashed hopes because of the astronomical expectations that have been set for it, and the way it has become a high-profile political and moral issue. \u201cRight now, we're in a honeymoon phase,\u201d Kay says, \u201cbut I'm really worried that this is going to be similar to what happened in gene therapy, where there was way too much hype, things don't come as quickly as people want, and there's a backlash.\u201d For now, such concerns may seem premature. But soon the new grantees will have to start the hard work of actually spending the money. And all eyes will be on them to see whether they can deliver.

Officials at the University of California are in the throes of a debate on whether to ban research grants from tobacco companies. The discussion has now sparked an independent review of a controversial 2003 report that contested the dangers of second-hand smoke. Researchers within the nine-campus university can accept money for research from the tobacco industry unless their department specifically bans it. To critics, the new uproar is an example of why all scientists should be prohibited from taking such grants. \u201cThis devastatingly shows university policies and procedures are not robust enough to deal with the influence of tobacco money,\u201d says Stanton Glantz, a professor of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco, and a long-time critic of tobacco grants (L. A. Bero  et al .  Tob. Control   14,  118\u2013126; 2005). Robert Dynes, president of the university system, has led the fight to continue tobacco funding, saying that stopping it would infringe academic freedom and possibly hinder other business grants. He has also argued that university policies adequately regulate the ethics of such funding. The new review concerns a study in the  British Medical Journal  ( BMJ ) that said spouses of smokers were no more likely to die of lung cancer and heart disease than were spouses of non-smokers (J. E. Enstrom and G. C. Kabat  Br. Med. J.   326,  1057; 2003). The study, led by epidemiologist James Enstrom of the University of California, Los Angeles, looked at 118,000 subjects from a study set up by the American Cancer Society beginning in 1959. But top scientists at the cancer society say they repeatedly warned Enstrom of possible deficiencies in his analysis \u2014 particularly a 25-year gap in which exposure to second-hand smoke could not be verified. The society also says that when it gave Enstrom computerized records of study subjects, it was not aware that he was receiving funding from the tobacco industry. Later tobacco-related lawsuits revealed he had received money from industry funnelled through an organization called the Center for Indoor Air Research. And court records show Enstrom previously did consulting and research for attorneys defending the tobacco companies R. J. Reynolds and Philip Morris. In August 2006, a US federal judge cited the  BMJ  study as a prime example of how nine tobacco companies engaged in criminal racketeering and fraud to hide the dangers of tobacco smoke. The tobacco companies dispute the judge's decision, which they are appealing. Enstrom and his co-author Geoffrey Kabat, formerly of the State University of New York at Stony Brook, stoutly defend the research against its critics. \u201cThey have engaged in a very sophisticated four-year campaign of disinformation about me,\u201d says Enstrom. \u201cI have withstood incredible attacks.\u201d The latest round of debate began last autumn when the chief executive of the American Cancer Society, John Seffrin, wrote a letter to the University of California's board of regents arguing that tobacco funding should be banned. In the 12 October letter, Seffrin argued that tobacco-funded front groups \u201cpublicized misleading results\u201d while giving \u201cthe false implication\u201d that the society had endorsed the study. He cited Enstrom's  BMJ  article in particular, alleging that Enstrom \u201cignored\u201d complaints of \u201cfundamental methodological problems\u201d. But the letter never made it to the regents at the time, because of what Dynes now calls an error in handling correspondence; he has initiated a review of such practices. The letter became more widely known when Glantz showed it on an overhead screen during a regents meeting on 18 January. The next day, Wyatt Hume, provost at the University of California's president's office, wrote to Seffrin saying that the university \u201ctakes allegations of scientific misconduct extremely seriously\u201d. If there is \u201cspecific information in support of an allegation of scientific misconduct against Enstrom\u201d, he wrote, he would relay it to officials at the Los Angeles campus so that they \u201ccan pursue the matter further\u201d. Shortly after, officials at the cancer society sent a seven-page list of what they cited as issues with the  BMJ  article. On 16 February, Dynes wrote a four-page letter to regents chairman Richard Blum noting how the allegations about the  BMJ  article didn't follow the form of a typical complaint. \u201cWe decided to err on the side of caution and refer the matter to the appropriate campus official for follow-up,\u201d Dynes wrote. Officials at the Los Angeles campus \u201cwill conduct a thorough review of the documents\u201d, he wrote, and \u201cwill take further steps to determine whether any research misconduct took place\u201d. In an interview, Enstrom acknowledged receiving the various letters and corresponding with the University of California's authorities. \u201cI am working on this with regents' approval,\u201d he said. \u201cI am being allowed to defend myself by the appropriate people.\u201d He \u201cabsolutely\u201d denies any misconduct in the study. And Kabat objects to the university's regent policies being based \u201con allegations motivated by a political agenda and unsupported by any facts\u201d. The university's regents are expected to revisit the debate on tobacco funding in May. \n                     Tobacco money sparks squabble at California universities \n                   \n                     All in a puff over passive smoking \n                   \n                     BMJ Enstrom, Kabat article \n                   \n                     Scientific Integrity Institute \n                   \n                     Legacy Tobacco Documents Library \n                   \n                     Judge Kessler racketeering ruling/order \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Craig Venter is still sailing his  Sorcerer II  sloop around the world, but now he has got 6.3 billion base pairs of microbial DNA to show for it. The pioneer of large-scale genome sequencing has published the first data set from his global quest to sequence microbes from all the oceans. In a series of papers published this week in  PLoS Biology , an international team of researchers presents the first results from Venter's Global Ocean Sampling expedition ( http://collections.plos.org/plosbiology/gos-2007.php ). It follows an earlier, smaller study that uncovered rich microbial diversity in the Sargasso Sea (J. C. Venter  et al .  Science   304 , 66\u201374; 2004). The analyses of the first set of 7.7 million genetic sequences from the expedition reveal that the upper limit on ocean diversity has yet to be set. The papers point to 1,700 new protein families. Surprisingly, the rate of discovery stayed more or less the same as the number of new sequences grew, suggesting that the number of new protein families will continue to increase. The question, said Venter in a telephone interview from  Sorcerer II  as it bobbed its way through the Sea of Cortez, is how long will that increase continue? And how does one extract meaning from a pile of 6.3 billion As, Ts, Cs and Gs? The Global Ocean Sampling results reported this week include sequences gathered from 41 locations in 2003 and 2004, from the northwest Atlantic to the eastern tropical Pacific. \u201cThe next phase is to try with a much larger data set from the entire circumnavigation,\u201d said Venter. \u201cWe want to find out if it starts to show any degree of saturation, or is the number of independent protein and gene families so vast that we are still at the earliest stage.\u201d The team has faced some challenges. It has to predict protein sequences on the basis of the DNA sequences it retrieves from its samples. This can be tricky, because not all DNA codes for protein, and some bits of DNA can be read in different ways to produce different protein sequences. It will be important to go back and confirm that the predicted proteins are actually made, says Monica Orellana, a systems biologist at the Institute for Systems Biology in Seattle, Washington. And Brian Palenik, a microbiologist at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla, California, cautions that many sequences that seem to belong to new protein families may in fact be members of known families that contain highly divergent sequences. Still, although the hard numbers might be toned down in the future, Orellana and Palenik don't question that the Global Ocean Sampling database contains a wealth of new proteins. Already, researchers are tracing the course of protein evolution using the database. Others will search it for new enzymes that might have technological applications, or use it to learn more about microbial ecology. For instance, Jonathan Eisen, a study co-author and microbiologist at the University of California, Davis, will work to match gene fragments in the database with their host organism, a substantial technical challenge when dealing with unfamiliar microbes. Such studies need to be followed by experiments to establish the function that the gene sequence actually has in the organism, warns Eugene Madsen, a microbiologist at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York. \u201cYou can over-interpret DNA sequence data,\u201d he says, \u201cbut if you're careful, you just use them as a clue and then they either lead to solving the mystery or they don't.\u201d Dennis Hansell, a microbiologist at the University of Miami in Florida, adds that although his research won't entail direct analysis of the Global Ocean Sampling sequence data, the newfound wealth of microbial diversity has made him re-evaluate his picture of how microbes leave their chemical fingerprints in the ocean. He likens the collection of genomic sequences to characterizing all of the pigments an artist could use to paint a portrait. \u201cIt's blending the pigments and applying them that results in a Mona Lisa,\u201d Hansell says. \u201cI'm looking at the Mona Lisa in my data, and this shows me what the pigments are.\u201d \n                 See Editorial,  \n                 \n                     page 231 \n                   \n               \n                     Genome pioneer sets sights on Sargasso Sea \n                   \n                     Portrait of a serial sequencer \n                   \n                     It came from beneath the sea \n                   \n                     Genome project aims to take Manhattan \n                   \n                     Nature Genetics blog \n                   \n                     Sorcerer II  Expedition page \n                   \n                     J.

A controversial US study of environmental effects on children's health got a boost last week, when the congressman who holds the House purse strings for the project vowed to keep it funded despite resistance from the White House. At a hearing on Capitol Hill on 6 March, Representative David Obey (Democrat, Wisconsin) complained that President George W. Bush's budget request for 2008 eliminated funding for the National Children's Study, as the president had also done the previous year. Authorized by Congress in 2000, the project would follow up 100,000 children from early in the womb until they reached their 21st birthday, examining the effects of everything from video games to chemical pollutants on their health and development. The study is planned for 105 sites nationwide and is expected to cost at least US$3.1 billion over 25 years. Although the study does not specifically target the benefits of apple pie, it might be expected to enjoy a similar popularity among politicians \u2014 who doesn't want to discover the environmental triggers of autism and asthma? But the cost is raising red flags. \u201cThere's no opposition or scientific reluctance on our part\u201d to doing the study, Elias Zerhouni, director of the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) in Bethesda, Maryland, told Obey at the hearing. But Zerhouni said that the agency had to make tough choices to maintain support for bench scientists and, in particular, young investigators. \u201cClearly, unless there were additional resources, it wouldn't have been wise to sacrifice the next generation [of scientists] for this study,\u201d he said. Obey, who is chair of the House Committee on Appropriations, said that he would solve that problem in 2008 by restoring money for the children's study. \u201cWe are going to put that money back next year too,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd it will not squeeze other research because we will expand the institutes' budget, just as we did this year.\u201d In February, Obey and his Senate counterparts added an extra $620 million to the NIH's budget for 2007 (see  Nature   445 , 572\u2013573; 2007), including $58 million to fund the children's study. Early this month, study administrators asked contractors to pitch proposals for managing up to 30 of the 105 sites. For 2008, they are hoping for another $111 million. Duane Alexander, director of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development in Bethesda, Maryland, said that Obey's vow to deliver funding came as \u201ca welcome surprise\u201d. The study sets out to answer big questions, Alexander says. \u201cIf there were a cheaper, smaller, faster way to answer them, you would do it. But there isn't. And as we get answers about environmental factors, it's going to pay for itself many, many, many times over.\u201d Over 25 years the study is expected to grow up to join the ranks of massive population studies, such as the Framingham Heart Study, that have yielded troves of information on disease causes and associations. If, that is, it doesn't die in its infancy. \n                     Budget cuts put children's health study on chopping block \n                   \n                     Huge study of children aims to get the dirt on development \n                   \n                     The National Children's Study \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Anti-fraud officials are investigating one of the founders of a controversial science academy over allegations concerning financial irregularities in European research projects,  Nature  has learned. Staff at the European Anti-Fraud Office in Brussels have launched an investigation into allegations made against geophysicist Philip Carrion. The office, set up in 1999, has the power to investigate allegations of misuse of European Commission (EC) funds. Spokeswoman Ingeborg Gaspard, confirming that an investigation was ongoing, would not give details of the research involved. But  Nature  has identified three projects involving Carrion, all funded by the EC's Framework programme for research, in which disputes over finances have arisen and complaints been made to the commission. Carrion rejects all allegations of financial impropriety and says he welcomes the investigation as a chance to clear up the disputes. Carrion first came to the attention of the science community in 2002, after  Nature  investigated the European Academy of Sciences (EAS). The invitation-only academy, which Carrion helped establish in 2002, claimed to have been founded to bring together scientists in Europe and elsewhere, but at the time it seemed to have no publications, projects or meetings, despite listing 600 members (see  Nature   419 , 865; 2002). Some researchers named as members, including Nobel laureates, said at the time that they had never heard of the organization. But Carrion and his colleagues have continued to develop the academy, which is based in Li\u00e8ge, Belgium, where Carrion lives. According to the academy's president, H\u00e9l\u00e8ne de Rode, a lawyer with Musch, de Pierpont, de Rode, Lahaye in Li\u00e8ge, the academy now has around 650 members. It publishes newsletters and a journal,  Annals . But Carrion's role as a member of the academy's executive committee ended when he resigned on 16 February. Carrion says he had spent years working for the academy for free and did not want to go on giving his time for nothing. De Rode declined to expand on the reasons for his departure. Before Carrion's resignation, the academy's website listed him as a professor at the University of Udine, Italy. Gaetano Russo, head of the university's civil-engineering department, says that Carrion was given visiting professor status between 2001 and 2004 in order to work on a project on advanced aluminium alloys. Russo says Carrion agreed to run mechanical tests at Udine that he failed to carry out, and then asked Russo to sign an agreement saying the work had been done and requesting payment of \u20ac100,000 (US$130,000) from the EC, to be split between them. Russo declined to sign, and in June 2005 wrote to the commission to make clear that the work had not taken place. For his part, Carrion says he never asked for money and that the Udine lab was not used in the alloys project because it did not have the right equipment. More recently, disputes have arisen between Carrion and Andr\u00e9 Leclercq, a human-resources manager with the steel company Arcelor in Li\u00e8ge. Leclercq says he employed Carrion in 2005 as a technical manager on a Framework-funded project on thin-film technology. He says he was introduced to Carrion through the academy. Carrion says that as part of his role in the Framework project, he agreed to carry out a marketing study and develop a business plan for Api, a business-development organization based in Ancona, Italy, and a partner in the project. He also says he agreed to manage a bank account into which payments for Api's work would be made. Leclercq says that an advance of \u20ac479,000 of EC money was paid in July 2005 into the account controlled by Carrion, in part to pay for the business plan and marketing study. Carrion says he completed the full documents last November, but Leclercq did not receive them until 9 March. By this time a complaint had been made to the commission and a second payment withheld. Carrion adds that he has received no money from the Api account he controls and has still not been paid for his work. Api could not be reached for comment. A third complaint concerning a project involving Carrion was made in July 2006. Stan Veprek, a materials scientist at the Technical University of Munich, says he contacted the commission after becoming concerned over Carrion's financial management of a project to develop new machine tools. During the project, some funds were transferred into an account named \u201cEAS\u201d, but Carrion says these have now been repaid. Carrion adds that a disagreement over payments arose because Veprek did not do the work required. Veprek denies this. Although no other members of the academy have been linked to the allegations made against Carrion, the organization itself has been the subject of intense criticism from its members. The academy's journal  Annals  is not listed on indexes such as PubMed, and it organizes meetings only infrequently. Boris Verkhovsky, a computer scientist at the New Jersey Institute of Technology in Newark, who has openly clashed with de Rode in the past, speaks for many members when he complains of a lack of transparency about the decisions made by the organization's executive committee. De Rode says she has received no official communication from the commission and cannot comment on the investigation or a possible link to Carrion's departure. On the future of the academy, she says: \u201cThere is no link between the well-being and future of the EAS to one of its past executives, Professor Carrion. The same observation applies to Professor Verkhovsky. Both of them were active in the establishment of our academy, but, as time went on, their personal involvement was duly replaced by the activity of committees, which is perfectly normal. The EAS is fulfilling its mission admirably, and the best is still to come.\u201d \n                     Academy slams Internet arts and sciences lookalike \n                   \n                     European Academy of Sciences \n                   \n                     European Academy of Sciences \n                   \n                     European Anti-Fraud Office \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Among those paying close attention to the European Union (EU) summit meeting on greenhouse-gas emissions in Brussels last week was Klaus T\u00f6pfer. As German minister for the environment and reactor safety from 1987 to 1994 and under-secretary-general of the United Nations and director of the UN Environment Programme in 1998\u20132006, T\u00f6pfer has been keeping an eye on international climate and energy diplomacy for two decades. He talked to  Quirin Schiermeier  about the EU's commitment to cut overall greenhouse-gas emissions by at least 20% by 2020, compared with 1990 levels. These cuts would rise to 30% if the United States and other industrialized countries were to commit themselves to 'comparable' emissions cuts after 2012, and if large developing countries including China contribute 'adequately'. \n               What do you think of the summit's outcome? \n             EU leaders know well enough that a 20% reduction is the absolute minimum, that's why they have offered 30% as an additional option. It is the maximum outcome that takes into account the political preconditions in the enlarged EU. In any case, it is a remarkable success for the German Chancellor Angela Merkel. \n               What more would you have hoped for? \n             The agreements must be specified further, and, importantly, they must be of a binding nature. We need to go for the 30% target and be aware that the 20% target for renewable energy would benefit from a more structured and more detailed decision on different renewables. \n               What do you think about the French proposal to treat nuclear energy on equal terms with renewable energies? \n             Whether or not to use nuclear energy to achieve the target must be the sovereign responsibility of each member state. This is also the EU's position, and it is a very wise decision. [But] increasing nuclear's share in a way that it would make a real contribution to substituting use of fossil energy would vastly increase political, safety and resource issues. We have to do our utmost to invent a nuclear-free energy supply structure. \n               Do you think the EU agreement will have a positive impact on international climate negotiations for the post-2012 period? \n             Yes, without a doubt. The leadership the EU has taken gives a clear signal, especially to the fast-growing economies in Asia, that we are aware of the Rio de Janeiro principle of 'common but differentiated responsibility'. \n               Which concrete measures \u2014 technological, political and regulatory \u2014 are needed to make sure the EU can achieve the goals agreed on? \n             With regards to technology, we need a revolution in energy efficiency. Energy efficiency is a chance to achieve a short-term, high return on investments to reduce energy intensity. And this is going over the whole range of energy demand, from buildings to mobility to electrical goods. In political terms, these positive, far-reaching results should pave the way for a Kyoto follow-up beyond 2012. As far as the regulatory framework is concerned, the most important thing is the need to internalize the costs of carbon dioxide in the energy price of fossil fuels. \n                     No more hot air \n                   \n                     Europe moves to secure its future energy supply \n                   \n                     How much will it cost to save the world? \n                   \n                     The costs of global warming \n                   \n                     Climate change in focus \n                   \n                     The Council of the European Union \n                   \n                     United Nations Environmental Programme \n                   \n                     World Business Council for Sustainable Development \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

There once was a man and his concubine from the Israeli tribe of Ephraim who were travelling in the land of Benjamin, another Israeli tribe. As the couple dined in the city of Gibeah, a mob assembled outside and pounded on the door. The mob captured the concubine, then raped and beat her to death. The man collected her corpse the next day and travelled home. The other tribes of Israel were outraged at the crime, assembled an army and razed several Benjamite cities, killing every man, woman, child and animal they could. Around 500 students recently read a version of this story, which is based on a passage from the Old Testament, as part of a psychological study. For half of the participants the tale contained an additional passage: when the man returned home, his tribe prayed to God and asked what they should do. God commanded the tribe to \u201ctake arms against their brothers and chasten them before the Lord\u201d. After reading the story, the students participated in another exercise intended to measure aggression. About half of the study participants came from Brigham Young University, a religious university in Provo, Utah, and almost all were members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. The other half came from the Free University in Amsterdam. Only 50% of the Dutch group believed in God and 27% in the Bible. But for both groups \u2014 whether the students were based in the Netherlands or the United States, and believed in God or not \u2014 the trend was the same: those who were told that God had sanctioned the violence against the Israelite were more likely to act aggressively in the subsequent exercise. The study is indicative of a growing interest among psychologists and sociologists in the origins of religious violence. That subject was taboo until recently for many psychologists, and past research tended to focus on the role of religion in psychological healing. But heightening concern about religious terrorism has pushed negative uses of religion to the forefront. \u201cPeople often use God as a justification for committing violent acts,\u201d says Brad Bushman, a social psychologist at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor and lead author of the study. \u201cAnd that just bothers me, I guess.\u201d The results of Bushman's study, to be published in the March issue of  Psychological Science , do not indicate that religious people are more aggressive than non-religious people (B. J. Bushman  et al .  Psychol. Sci.   18,  204\u2013207; 2007). Furthermore, the story us ed was an isolated example of scriptural violence taken out of context, and thus does not reflect the experience of reading the Bible as a whole. But it does suggest that selective exposure to violent passages in a scriptural canon can promote aggression. That response probably reflects a long-standing finding in psychology that people respond more aggressively to a depiction of violence that they feel is justified, says Robert Ridge, a social psychologist at Brigham Young University and a co-author ofthe study. Sociologist Mark Juergensmeyer of the University of California, Santa Barbara, says his research has also pointed to the motivational power of scriptural violence, but that the context of the message is key. \u201cIf violence is presented as the authoritative voice of God, it can increase the possibility of more violence,\u201d says Juergensmeyer. \u201cBut everything depends on how it is presented.\u201d The same passage placed in a non-threatening, historical context might not promote aggression, he argues. Nevertheless, when scriptural violence is used to promote hostility, it is extremely effective, Juergensmeyer adds. Invoking religious justification allows a political leader to believe in promises of immortality and spiritual rewards that can be powerful motivators. \u201cReligion is not the problem,\u201d he says. \u201cBut it can make a secular problem worse.\u201d People often choose to ignore the violent side to religion, says John Hall, a sociologist at the University of California, Davis, and they tend to dismiss those who commit religiously inspired violence as members of the fringe. \u201cThere are built-in cultural lenses that we use to dissociate religion from violence,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen we see religious movements that are prophetically inspired and engaged in violence, there's a cultural tendency to say 'oh, they're not really religious'.\u201d That view represents a misleading, selective interpretation of most religious canons, agrees theologian Hector Avalos of Iowa State University in Ames. \u201cPeople who choose the violent interpretation are no less arbitrary than those who choose the peaceful one,\u201d he says. Avalos has proposed a radical solution to theologically inspired violence \u2014 cut the violent passages out of the scripture. It's a wildly controversial idea that ought not to be, he says, because spiritual leaders effectively do that on a regular basis. \u201cA lot of churches have a series of passages that they read during the year,\u201d says Avalos. \u201cAnd usually they don't choose the passages involving genocide.\u201d \n                     When science and theology meet \n                   \n                     Genomics luminary weighs in on US faith debate \n                   \n                     Study challenges prayers for the sick \n                   \n                     Psychologists warn of more suicide attacks in the wake of London bombs \n                   \n                     Across the great divide \n                   \n                     Religion and Science In Focus \n                   \n                     Brad Bushman's webpage \n                   \n                     Hector Avalos' webpage \n                   \n                     Mark Juergensmeyer's webpage \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

If the federal government doesn't get its act together on carbon trading, individual US states will come together to decide policy instead. That was the clear message when the governors of five western states \u2014 Washington, Oregon, California, Arizona and New Mexico \u2014 signed an agreement on 26 February to create their own carbon cap-and-trade programme. The move parallels a similar scheme developed by northeastern states; together the two regions account for nearly a quarter of US carbon emissions. As California's governor Arnold Schwarzenegger puts it: \u201cThis agreement shows the power of states to lead our nation in addressing climate change.\u201d The western group is moving relatively quickly. It also intends to go further than the northeastern scheme, the ten-state Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI), which focuses on the electricity industry. \u201cWithin 18 months, we want to return with a design for a multi-sector, market-based system,\u201d says Dan Skopec, an undersecretary at the California Environmental Protection Agency. Each state will set its own caps. California was already devising a market approach to managing emissions. But some worried that regulated companies would leave the state to avoid being capped. The new scheme, the Western Regional Climate Action Initiative (WRCAI), has nearly all the states that border California on board, so such leakage seems unlikely. The exception is Nevada, but Skopec says he still hopes it will join. In the electricity sector, the WRCAI may operate differently to RGGI. Starting in 2009, RGGI will cap companies that generate energy, and they must then either ramp down operations, invest in cleaner technologies, or buy offsets to meet their targets. California had favoured the idea of capping the distributors who sell electricity to the customer, to cover all electricity sold in the region no matter where it was produced. But with neighbouring states on board as well, the scheme may stick to capping the generators. On a national level, the Democratic Congress is holding hearings and proposing bills on emissions at a breakneck pace, but even with the new initiative, the crucial 60 votes needed in the Senate look unlikely to be found. As such schemes become more popular, however, pressure will mount on the federal government to come up with a cap-and-trade scheme or risk having states do it for them. According to the Pew Center on Global Climate Change, if all the states in the two regional schemes counted as a country they would be the world's fourth largest emitter. \u201cAt some point you have critical mass. At some point you have enough of a system that it just becomes the standard, and states sign on voluntarily or the federal government will just adopt it,\u201d says V\u00e9ronique Bugnion, the Washington DC-based director of research for emissions trading consultants Point Carbon. To help reach that critical mass, the two schemes may link up, and perhaps even join forces with the European Union (EU) Emission Trading Scheme. \u201cThe bigger the market, the more cost-effective reductions are available,\u201d says John Larsen, a research analyst at the World Resources Institute, an environmental group in Washington DC. \u201cIt will be interesting to see how they move forward and who they talk to.\u201d Skopec says that California is already moving towards this, but there are some potential hitches. One problem is the different way the schemes are regulated. For example, if more states joined the two US groups, electricity generated in a RGGI state and exported to a state in the WRCAI, which may regulate distributors, could potentially be counted twice. And differences in how tough the caps are could set up a lopsided situation in which companies in low-cap areas keep buying credits from high-cap areas. \u201cYou have to link equivalents,\u201d says Bugnion. \u201cIf one system is more stringent than another, the credits will only flow one way.\u201d There's also the problem that the EU trading scheme operates under the aegis of the Kyoto Protocol, a treaty that the United States hasn't ratified and that individual US states cannot join. A looser form of linking may be easier. The RGGI plan already allows the purchase of offset credits from projects certified by the Clean Development Mechanism, an apparatus of the Kyoto Protocol. A shared pool of available offsets can bring prices in the separate markets closer together, even if they aren't linked directly. \n                     Carbon copies \n                   \n                     Bush calls for cuts in petrol use \n                   \n                     How much will it cost to save the world? \n                   \n                     Carbon market survives gas leaks \n                   \n                     Regional Climate Change special \n                   \n                     Climate Change In Focus \n                   \n                     California press release on the new group \n                   \n                     Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Denver, Colorado They were lionized in the press, celebrated by the US government, and even given exclusive access to New York City nightclubs \u2014 that was 20 years ago. This week, the physicists who made key early breakthroughs in the field of high-temperature superconductivity recalled their fame and expressed hopes that the field would once again dramatically move forward. Back then, in a marathon session on the evening of 18 March 1987, at a meeting of the American Physical Society, researchers discussed a new-found class of 'superconducting' material that carried electrical current without resistance at dramatically higher temperatures than its predecessors. The impromptu lectures at the New York City Hilton ran until after 3 a.m. and were later dubbed the \u201cWoodstock\u201d of physics. \u201cThe euphoria was really unbelievable,\u201d says Paul Grant, a physicist at Stanford University, California, who was there that night. By contrast, the mood was nostalgic at this year's American Physical Society meeting, held this week in Denver, Colorado, when many of those at the original 1987 session gathered for a reunion and to discuss the future. Superconducting materials differ markedly from other conductors. Normally, the atomic lattice in a metal causes electrons to scatter, creating heat. But in superconductors, the electrons pair together in a way that allows them to travel effortlessly through the material. Superconductivity was first discovered in 1911, and described in theoretical calculations in 1957 by John Bardeen, Leon Cooper and John Robert Schrieffer. The materials offer the tantalizing possibility of allowing energy to be transmitted with virtually no loss, promising powerful motors and better generators. But the low temperatures at which superconductors originally worked prevented them from being practical. For most of the 1970s and 1980s, the record for a high-temperature superconductor remained at a miserable 23 kelvin, or 23 degrees above absolute zero. Then in 1986, Georg Bednorz and Alex M\u00fcller of IBM's Zurich Research Laboratory in R\u00fcschlikon discovered a new class of superconductor that worked at 30 K. These cuprates, as they are known, consisted of layers of copper oxide with small amounts of other materials added. The IBM work was soon confirmed by others, including Paul Chu of the University of Houston, Texas, who discovered an yttrium\u2013barium\u2013copper oxide material that could superconduct at 93 K, above the temperature of liquid nitrogen. The discovery meant that superconductors would be cheaper to cool and easier to use. \u201cIt created the feeling in many people that nothing is impossible,\u201d says Bednorz, who won the 1987 Nobel physics prize with M\u00fcller for their discovery. Condensed-matter physicists found themselves turned into overnight celebrities. \u201cNew Superconductors Offer Chance to Do the Impossible,\u201d trumpeted  The New York Times . Physicists were invited to the White House for a demonstration to then-President Ronald Reagan and given free passes to a New York City discoth\u00e8que. \u201cIt was a heady, heady experience,\u201d says Grant. Buoyed by the promises, Congress passed the Superconductivity Competitiveness Act of 1988, which boosted funding for the field. But there remained a problem. Nobody knew exactly how the new materials worked. After their initial discovery, little progress was made in increasing their operating temperatures. And, because the materials were ceramic, they proved difficult to manufacture and incorporate into existing infrastructures. Today, says Grant, little has come of those early claims. \u201cNo high-temperature superconducting technology is turning a profit,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you reflect back on 1987 there were a lot of futures promised, I think irresponsibly.\u201d And the scientific field has also slowed. Although more than 100 superconducting cuprate materials have been discovered, the record for superconductivity remains at 164 K, about halfway between absolute zero and room temperature. The theoretical understanding of the material is incomplete as well, says physicist Douglas Scalapino of the University of California, Santa Barbara. Although many researchers believe that electrons pairs underlie superconductivity even in these new materials, no one knows how the electrons bind together. \u201cWe don't understand what causes it,\u201d he says. A low point came last September when two German researchers predicted that, given current trends, publications of papers in high-temperature superconductivity would end between 2010 and 2015. The researchers later revised their estimates, but not before angering many scientists (see  Nature   443 , 376\u2013377; doi:10.1038/443376b 2006 ). But despite the frustrating lack of progress, many remain hopeful. Room-temperature superconductors may yet be found, says Chu: \u201cAt this moment, there's no evidence, either theoretical or experimental, that tells us it's impossible.\u201d And high-temperature cuprates may soon find some applications in defence, says Grant. The materials' electrical efficiency may make them useful for high-power microwave beams that can be used to disable small ships. Optimists say the field could be reinvigorated at any time by a new discovery, whether through serendipity or otherwise. \u201cIf something happens, there will be another Woodstock and another explosion,\u201d Grant says. \n                     Superconductivity research is down but not out \n                   \n                     Hot superconductors, 20 years on \n                   \n                     Superconductivity fights back \n                   \n                     High-Temperature Superconducting Explained \n                   \n                     Muller/Bednorz Nobel Prize \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

The Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California has won a competition to design a new nuclear warhead for the United States. The blueprint could become the basis for the first such weapon produced in more than 20 years. The Reliable Replacement Warhead (RRW) is intended to replace the 10,000 or so weapons in the current nuclear stockpile, without the need for testing. The United States has maintained a moratorium on the testing of nuclear weapons since 1992. The design by the Livermore laboratory and Sandia National Laboratories in New Mexico was chosen over that from the Los Alamos National Laboratory because it was based on previously tested components that would, officials say, provide greater confidence that it could be certified without testing. The RRW is meant to be a safer and more reliable bomb than the warheads in the current stockpile. For example, it won't use toxic beryllium as today's warheads do, and 'insensitive explosives' will replace conventional ones to trigger the nuclear reaction, lowering the risk that the bomb will go off accidentally. \u201cIt's not about starting a new arms race,\u201d says Steve Henry, deputy assistant to the secretary of defence for nuclear matters. \u201cThe new design gives us an opportunity to move on from methods and techniques used during the cold war.\u201d But critics note that the language the agency has used to defend the RRW programme has shifted since discussions began in earnest in 2005. At first, the main argument in support of the RRW was that the current stockpile might become unreliable if radioactivity leaking from the plutonium pit damaged the surrounding metal. But research released last November showed that the current generation of weapons will last for 85\u2013100 years (see  Nature   444 , 660\u2013661; doi:10.1038/444660a 2006 ). \u201cNow if you read their press statements, it's all about improving safety and security,\u201d says Robert Nelson, a physicist at the Union of Concerned Scientists' Global Security Program in Washington DC. Others argue that if the RRW project goes ahead, it could actually increase pressure to resume testing. One of its goals is to keep generations of engineers and scientists trained in nuclear-weapons skills, which would require designing and redesigning the warheads. Philip Coyle, senior adviser to the Center for Defense Information in Washington DC, says that he finds it hard to see how the cumulative effects of successive modifications could be certified without a return to testing. But for the programme to move forward, the costs and a production plan will need to be agreed by Congress, some key members of which have already expressed their opposition to the project. \n                     Enough warheads, already \n                   \n                     US backs revamp of nuclear warheads \n                   \n                     Rich in plutonium \n                   \n                     Nuclear weapons: The next nuke \n                   \n                     The Union of Concerned Scientists \n                   \n                     Arms Control Association (article by Robert Nelson) \n                   \n                     National Nuclear Security Administration \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Tokyo Biobanks, which combine genetic and lifestyle data from thousands of people, are increasingly being used to help researchers understand the roots of disease. But they can be used to study other things, such as behaviour. An experimental biobank set to open in Japan next month aims to do just that \u2014 for dogs. Four years ago Hiroshi Suzuki, a professor of functional genomics at the Obihiro University of Agriculture and Veterinary Medicine in Hokkaido, found out that Japan suffers from an acute shortage of guide dogs, and decided to do something about it. Training guide dogs is time-consuming and expensive, costing about \u00a52.7 million (US$23,000) per dog. And even among labrador retrievers, which are particularly suited to the role, only about 30% of the dogs that are trained work out as guide dogs. Unfortunately, it is difficult to predict which puppies will make good guide dogs, says Takafumi Wada, head of the guide-dog association in Hokkaido, with which Suzuki is collaborating. And that's where Suzuki's database comes in. Guide dogs have to be neutered before training starts, so successful dogs cannot be used for breeding. Suzuki gets round this by freezing testis and ovary tissue from dogs before training, with a view to breeding from the best. But ultimately he wants to develop genetic tests to select suitable dogs for breeding and to measure puppies' aptitude before they enter training. He adds that a similar approach could be applied to select dogs suitable for police duties or to make good pets. So far, Suzuki has screened DNA from 200 labradors. He has looked at 13 genetic variations called single nucleotide polymorphisms, or SNPs, and found five SNPs in three genes that he believes are related to guide-dog ability. In particular, a gene that codes for an enzyme called COMT (catechol- O -methyltransferase), which partly regulates mood in humans, seems to be involved in dogs' ability to concentrate, he says. In Suzuki's study, 80% of dogs with all five SNPs passed their training, whereas the pass rate was only 60% for dogs with just one of the SNPs. Suzuki is now writing up his results for publication. Suzuki admits that the number of dogs he has studied so far is too small to confirm the role of these genes in determining guide-dog ability, and he is working with guide-dog organizations in Finland and South Korea to collect at least 1,000 blood samples. \u201cSuzuki has a very innovative approach,\u201d says Yoshihisa Yamane, head of the Japan Veterinary Medical Association in Tokyo. \u201cWe hope he'll be able to breed more successful guide dogs.\u201d But Masanari Itokawa, who studies schizophrenia at the Tokyo Institute of Psychiatry, is sceptical, pointing out that the link between genetics and behaviour tends to be complex, and that large-scale studies using thousands of SNPs will be needed. \u201cWe can't find the relations between gene mutations and personalities or behaviours so easily,\u201d he says. But Suzuki thinks his work, which can draw on the dogs' detailed family histories, could serve as a model for human disease studies. \n                     The chips are down \n                   \n                     Genomics: SNPs and human disease \n                   \n                     Geneticists hail variety show \n                   \n                     One gene between tiny dogs and giant ones? \n                   \n                     Obihiro University of Agriculture and Veterinary Medicine \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Princeton A medley of random-event machines, including a kaleidoscopic crystal ball on a pendulum, a pipe spurting water and a motorized box straddled by a toy frog, came to the end of their working lives yesterday at the Princeton Engineering Anomalies Research (PEAR) laboratory in New Jersey. Only romantics \u2014 and some parapsychologists \u2014 are likely to lament the loss of this unique institution, which investigated whether people can alter the behaviour of machines using their thoughts. Many scientists think the lab's work was pointless at best. But the closure highlights a long-running question: how permissive should science be of research that doesn't fit a standard theoretical framework, if the methods used are scientific? The PEAR lab was founded in 1979 by Robert Jahn, former dean of Princeton's school of engineering and applied sciences, and an expert on electric propulsion. Start-up funds came from aerospace pioneer James McDonnell, who believed that aircraft machinery was influenced by the mental states of pilots. The lab has relied on private funds ever since. Over 28 years, PEAR researchers collected data from tens of millions of trials using random-event machines. When all the data are considered together, they show that human intention has a very slight effect, the researchers say. Whether the machine is a screen that flashes numbers or a fountain of water droplets, they say that, on average, people can shift 2\u20133 events out of 10,000 from chance expectations. It was Jahn's decision to close the lab. He set out to prove the existence of the effect and, at 76, believes the work is done. But such tiny deviations from chance have not convinced mainstream scientists, and the lab's results have been studiously ignored by the wider community. Apart from a couple of early reviews (R. G. Jahn  Proc. IEEE   70,  136\u2013170; 1982 and R. G. Jahn and B. J. Dunne  Found. Phys.   16,  721\u2013772; 1986), Jahn's papers were rejected from mainstream journals. Jahn believes he was unfairly judged because of the questions he asked, not because of methodological flaws. Even in other areas of parapsychology, opinion is divided on the lab's results. The difficulty is that it's virtually impossible to prove that such subtle effects aren't caused by some flaw in the methods or equipment. A recent meta-analysis (H. B\u00f6sch  et al .  Psychol. Bull.   132,  497\u2013523; 2006) combined 380 studies on the phenomenon, often termed psychokinesis, including data from the PEAR lab. It concluded that although there is a statistically significant overall effect, it is not consistent and relatively few negative studies would cancel it out, so biased publication of positive results could be the cause. Robert Park, a physicist at the University of Maryland, adds that if you run any test often enough, it's easy to get the \u201ctiny statistical edges\u201d the PEAR team seems to have picked up. If a coin is flipped enough times, for example, even a slight imperfection can produce more than 50% heads. In the end, the decision whether to pursue a tiny apparent effect or put it down to statistical flaws is a subjective one. \u201cIt raises the issue of where you draw the line,\u201d says sceptic Chris French, an 'anomalistic psychologist' at Goldsmiths, University of London, who tries to explain what seem to be paranormal experiences in straightforward psychological terms. French thinks that even though the chances of a real effect being discovered are low, the implications of a positive result would be so interesting that work such as Jahn's is worth pursuing. Many scientists disagree. Besides being a waste of time, such work is unscientific, they argue, because no attempt is ever made to offer a physical explanation for the effect. Park says the PEAR lab \u201cthreatened the reputation\u201d of both Princeton and the wider community. He sees the persistence of such labs as an unfortunate side effect of science's openness to new questions. \u201cThe surprising thing is that it doesn't happen more often,\u201d he says. William Happer, a prominent physicist at Princeton, takes the middle ground. He believes the scientific community should be open to research that asks any question, however unlikely, but that if experiments don't produce conclusive results after a reasonable time, researchers should move on. \u201cI don't know why this took up a whole lifetime,\u201d he says. The status of paranormal research in the United States is now at an all-time low, after a relative surge of interest in the 1970s. Money continues to pour from philanthropic sources to private institutions, but any chance of credibility depends on ties with universities, and only a trickle of research now persists in university labs. Elsewhere the field is livelier. Britain is a lead player, with privately funded labs at the universities of Edinburgh, Northampton and Liverpool Hope, among others. Parapsychologist Deborah Delanoy at the University of Northampton suspects that the field is stronger in Britain because researchers tend to work in conventional psychology departments, and also do studies in 'straight' psychology to boost their credibility and show that their methods are sound. \u201cWe're seen to be in the same business as other psychologists,\u201d she says. But parapsychologists are still limited to publishing in a small number of niche journals. French thinks the field is treated unfairly. \u201cI'm convinced that parapsychologists have a hard time trying to publish in mainstream journals,\u201d he says, adding that he even has difficulty publishing his 'straight' papers on why people believe in paranormal events: \u201cSimply because the paper mentions the word telepathy or psychokinesis, it isn't sent out to referees. People think the whole thing is a waste of time.\u201d \n                     The PEAR lab \n                   \n                     Robert Park \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Imagine that at a routine medical check-up your doctor takes a urine sample, then reports a few days later that your risk of type 2 diabetes is normal, but there are hints that your arteries are furring up. A similar scenario has been promised for the past 20 years by those working in genomics and proteomics, but has not yet materialized. Now, however, an increasing number of researchers are claiming that metabolomics \u2014 the study of all the body's metabolites \u2014 will finally come up with the goods. Supporters of this burgeoning branch of molecular medicine are gung-ho about their chances of success. \u201cIn retrospect, we wonder why we spent millions on the genome,\u201d says Bruce German, who studies lipid metabolism at the University of California, Davis. With the knowledge we have today, he reckons, scientists should have gone straight for the metabolome. But can it deliver? Metabolomics is the study of the raw materials and products of the body's biochemical reactions, molecules that are smaller than most proteins, DNA and other macromolecules. The aim is to be able to take urine, blood or some other body fluid, scan it in a machine and find a profile of tens or hundreds of chemicals that can predict whether an individual is on the road to a disease, say, or likely to experience side-effects from a particular drug. Researchers are already trying to flag impending disease by measuring levels of gene expression or proteins, but supporters of metabolomics say they should be able to do it better. Small changes in the activity of a gene or protein (which may have an unknown impact on the workings of a cell) often create a much larger change in metabolite levels. The approach has already proved its worth: cholesterol and glucose have long been chemical canaries for heart disease and diabetes. \n               Data fingerprinting \n             But realizing this vision isn't straightforward. One of the first tasks is to create a catalogue of compounds in the human body, and this is proving hard to define. David Wishart at the University of Alberta, Edmonton, and his colleagues have taken an initial step forward by producing something they rather grandly call the first draft of the human metabolome 1 . They searched the published literature for known human metabolites, and have collected around 2,500 of them into a public database ( http://www.hmdb.ca ) along with other information such as known links to disease. The researchers also used nuclear magnetic resonance and mass spectroscopy to produce characteristic 'fingerprints' for more than 400 compounds, and have added these to the database. It's the most comprehensive collection of metabolite data to be made publicly available. But others in the field point out that Wishart's catalogue is far from complete because the number and nature of compounds in the human metabolome will vary depending on which body fluid is looked at and the method used for the analysis. There is also no clear division between compounds produced by the human body, those produced by our gut bacteria and fleeting products generated by food or drugs swallowed that day. \u201cThe notion that this is a first draft of the human metabolome is nonsense,\u201d says Jeremy Nicholson of Imperial College London, one of the pioneers of the field. \u201cI agree that it covers a helluva lot of important metabolites, but it's a very arbitrary guess at what might be useful and what might not.\u201d An added complication is that one person's profile of metabolites is likely to be dramatically different from another's, and each may fluctuate markedly depending on the time of day, what they last ate and other aspects of their lifestyle. To get a handle on this variation, Nicholson has studied tens of thousands of urine samples from many ethnic groups around the world and found that each group is remarkably different. A separate study showed that the metabolic profile of meat eaters is very different from that of vegetarians 2 . This means that a person's metabolome might need to be measured many times during their lives in order to be able to pick out changes that might signal disease. Also, any one metabolite will have to be assessed relative to the pattern of many others. Whatever the total metabolite tally, researchers will have to prove that particular concentrations and combinations can reveal something about drugs or disease. Preliminary studies suggest that this can be done. Last year, for example, Nicholson and his colleagues showed that a fingerprint of the metabolites in urine could predict which rats would suffer liver damage from the drug paracetamol 3 . He says he has now shown the same in humans, and is preparing the study for publication. A team led by Douglas Kell at the University of Manchester, UK, has developed a computer model based on metabolite profiles in blood plasma that can identify pregnant women with the dangerous condition called pre-eclampsia 4 . \n               Lab on a chip \n             But just as with genomics and proteomics, finding profiles that reliably predict the onset of disease will be a major undertaking, because it will typically require sampling regular profiles from many thousands of people and then following them for years to see which ones develop a particular condition. Researchers are hopeful that biobanks \u2014 large collections of people's biological samples and medical records \u2014 will in future supply this information, but such studies could take decades. They will also have to learn from those working on gene-expression or proteomic profiles, who have sometimes struggled to show that a test that works in one group also works in another, or that the changes they see are actually involved in a disease. \u201cIn my opinion we should know why this metabolite is going up or down,\u201d says William Bigbee, an expert in biomarkers and proteomics at the University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute, Philadelphia. In the long run, the best way to predict an individual's disease risk is likely to come from understanding the biology behind each disease \u2014 and that will come from a combination of genomics, proteomics and metabolomics. \u201cI don't want to buy six machines,\u201d says Ben van Ommen of the Netherlands Organization for Applied Scientific Research in Zeist. \u201cI want a lab on a chip that measures metabolites, proteins and gene expression.\u201d \n                     Genetic test gets approval \n                   \n                     Crunch time for multiple-gene tests \n                   \n                     Urine test predicts drug response \n                   \n                     Cautious welcome for FDA pharmacogenomics guidance \n                   \n                     Proteomics and cancer: Running before we can walk? \n                   \n                     Human Metabolome Project \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

It's not often that George W. Bush takes time out to attack a scientific paper on the day that it's released. But then few papers attract as much attention as the one that claimed that more than half a million people, or 2.5% of the population, had died in Iraq as a result of the 2003 invasion. Published last October in the run-up to the US mid-term elections, the interview-based survey attracted huge press interest and controversy. The media spotlight has moved on, but interest within the scientific community has not. The paper has been dissected online, graduate classes have been devoted to it and critiques have appeared in the literature with more in press. So far, the discussion has created more heat than light. Many of the criticisms that dogged the study are unresolved. For example,  Nature  has discovered that different authors give conflicting accounts of exactly how the survey was carried out. And although many researchers say the questions hanging over the study are not substantial enough for it to be dismissed, a vocal minority disagrees. The controversy creates extra interest in the authors' decision, made last week, to release the raw data behind the study. Critics and supporters will finally have access to information that may settle disputes. On paper, the study seems simple enough. Eight interviewers questioned more than 1,800 households throughout Iraq. After comparing the mortality rate before and after the invasion, and extrapolating to the total population, they concluded that the conflict had caused 390,000\u2013940,000 excess deaths (G. Burnham, R. Lafta, S. Doocy and L. Roberts  Lancet   368,  1421\u20131428; 2006). This estimate was much higher than those based on media reports or Iraqi government data, which put the death toll at tens of thousands, and the authors, based at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland, and Al Mustansiriya University in Baghdad, have found their methods under intense scrutiny. Much of the debate has centred on exactly how the survey was run, and finding out exactly what happened in Iraq has not been straightforward. The Johns Hopkins team, which dealt with enquiries from other scientists and the media, was not able to go to the country to supervise the interviews. And accounts of the method given by the US researchers and the Iraqi team do not always match up. Several researchers, including Madelyn Hicks, a psychiatrist at King's College London, recently published criticisms of the study's methodology in  The Lancet  ( 369,  101\u2013105; 2007). One key question is whether the interviews could have been done in the time stated. The October paper implied that the interviewers worked as two teams of four, each conducting 40 interviews a day \u2014 a very high number given the need to obtain consent and the sensitive nature of the questions. The US authors subsequently said that each team split into two pairs, a workload that is \u201cdoable\u201d, says Paul Spiegel, an epidemiologist at the United Nations High Commission for Refugees in Geneva, who carried out similar surveys in Kosovo and Ethiopia. After being asked by  Nature  whether even this system allowed enough time, author Les Roberts of Johns Hopkins said that the four individuals in a team often worked independently. But an Iraqi researcher involved in the data collection, who asked not to be named because he fears that press attention could make him the target of attacks, told  Nature  this never happened. Roberts later said that he had been referring to the procedure used in a 2004 mortality survey carried out in Iraq with the same team (L. Roberts  et al .  Lancet   364,  1857\u20131864; 2004). Other arguments focus on the potential for 'main-street bias', first proposed by Michael Spagat, an expert in conflict studies at Royal Holloway, University of London. In each survey area, the interviewers selected a starting point by randomly choosing a residential street that crossed the main business street. Spagat says this method would have left out residential streets that didn't cross the main road and, as attacks such as car bombs usually take place in busy areas, introduced a bias towards areas likely to have suffered high casualties. The Iraqi interviewer told  Nature  that in bigger towns or neighbourhoods, rather than taking the main street, the team picked a business street at random and chose a residential street leading off that, so that peripheral parts of the area would be included. But again, details are unclear. Roberts and Gilbert Burnham, also at Johns Hopkins, say local people were asked to identify pockets of homes away from the centre; the Iraqi interviewer says the team never worked with locals on this issue. Many epidemiologists say such discrepancies are understandable given that Roberts and Burnham could not directly oversee the survey, and do not justify accusations that the process was flawed. For those who disagree, access to the raw data is essential. Although previously reluctant to release them, Roberts and Burnham now say they are removing information that could be used to identify interviewers or respondents and will release the data within the next month to people with appropriate \u201ctechnical competence\u201d. One researcher keen to see the numbers is Spagat. The 2004 survey used GPS coordinates instead of the main-street system to identify streets to sample, and when Spagat used the limited data available so far to compare the two studies for the period immediately following the invasion, he found that the 2006 study turned up twice as many violent deaths, suggesting that main-street bias may be present. Roberts and others question Spagat's methods. But the issue could be checked using the raw data. If main-street bias exists, says Spagat, then death rates will fall as the interviews move away from the main street. The raw data may also help address a fear that some researchers are expressing off the record: that the Iraqi interviewers might have inflated their results for political reasons. That could show up in unusual patterns within the data. Roberts and Burnham say they have complete confidence in the Iraqi interviewers, after working with them directly for the 2004 study. And supporters say that criticisms should not detract from the fact that the Iraqi team managed to produce a survey under extremely difficult circumstances. Security threats forced the team to change travel plans and at one point to consider cancelling the survey altogether. Since its completion, one interviewer has been killed and another has left Baghdad, although it is not known whether either case is linked to their involvement in the survey. Either way, the continuing violence in the country is enough for the remaining interviewers to say that they are not willing to repeat the exercise. \n                     Iraqi death toll withstands scrutiny \n                   \n                     Scientists become targets in Iraq \n                   \n                     German hostage was saving Iraq digs \n                   \n                     US bungled investigation into weapons research in Iraq \n                   \n                     100,000 civilians may have died in Iraq conflict \n                   \n                     2006 survey in  The Lancet \n                   \n                     Michael Spagat's website on the  The Lancet  survey \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

The search for new ways to curb HIV transmission received a badly needed boost last week.

Engl. J. Med.   356,  790\u2013799; 2007). The researchers suggest that controlling herpes may thus also control the spread of HIV. Studies are under way to test the idea. The following day, two large controlled trials on male circumcision in Uganda and Kenya were published (M. L. Newell & T. B\u00e4rnighausen  Lancet   369,  617\u2013619; 2007). Both trials had been stopped early by their funder, the US National Institutes of Health, because the effects of the procedure were already clear. Together with a previous study in South Africa, the results show that circumcision can reduce a man's risk of HIV infection by 50\u201360%. The task now is to roll out circumcision in countries that would most benefit, where HIV rates are high and the virus is spread mainly through heterosexual sex.

The Internet has already become a place for people to share knowledge, opinions, music and videos. Now, in a slightly geekier aspect of the same trend, social software is allowing people to share data too. More than 1 million data sets have been uploaded to the data-sharing site Swivel since its launch in December. And on 23 January, IBM labs launched Many Eyes, which allows users to visualize their data with tools previously available only to experts. Once data are uploaded to these sites (which are still being tested), people can reanalyse the numbers, mix them with other data and visualize them in different ways. Swivel focuses on letting users combine data sets, with some basic ways to present the results such as scatter graphs and bar charts. Many Eyes allows users to generate more complicated graphs such as network diagrams, which depict nodes and connections within networks, and treemaps, which display data as groups of nested rectangles. The idea is to make data analysis more democratic, as tools such as Google Earth have done for geographic visualization, says Fernanda Vi\u00e9gas of IBM's Visual Communication Lab in Cambridge, Massachusetts. \u201cWe want to provide the masses with access to visualization tools, especially interactive ones,\u201d she says. Governments, international agencies and research organizations generate huge silos of publicly available data on almost every aspect of society, but the public has never been able to explore, share and discuss these data sets easily, she points out. Making such tools available will not only empower individuals, Vi\u00e9gas predicts, the collective intelligence and expertise of users will result in new insights. \u201cJust three weeks in, people were using some of the most sophisticated visualization types,\u201d she says. Since Many Eyes launched, users have uploaded data and created graphics on everything from the stock price of Heineken against temperature, to collaborations of prostate cancer researchers, to co-occurrences of names in the New Testament. The new sites might also provide a model for better communication among scientists, says Brent Edwards, director of the Starkey Hearing Research Center in Berkeley, California, who blogs on innovation in science. He points out that journals could use the Internet to share information and move science forward much more effectively, rather than being facsimiles of their print cousins, with static graphs and figures. \u201cI'm often frustrated by my inability to analyse in a different way data that are printed in peer-reviewed publications, when I'm interested in looking at a relationship that the authors didn't think of,\u201d he says. If research organizations and journals linked the raw data behind papers to social software tools such as Swivel and Many Eyes, he argues, \u201cit would have considerable value to the scientific community as a whole\u201d. David Lipman, director of the US National Center for Biotechnology Information in Bethesda, Maryland agrees, adding that his centre might explore related possibilities. He finds it ironic that scientists have been slow to adopt social software, given how useful it could be for them. \u201cScientists are more interested in their careers and grants than using tools that promote better communication and data sharing,\u201d Lipman says. He's optimistic that this attitude may change in the future, however, especially as a new generation \u2014 used to communicating through social sites such as MySpace \u2014 enters research. \n                     The next wave of the web \n                   \n                     Mashups mix data into global service \n                   \n                     Let data speak to data \n                   \n                     Science in the web age: Joint efforts \n                   \n                     Google makes data free for all \n                   \n                     Many Eyes \n                   \n                     Swivel \n                   \n                     IBM Visual Communication Lab \n                   \n                     Ben Shneiderman \n                   \n                     Brent Edwards's blog \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

In just over a decade, two major ice shelves have collapsed on the eastern side of the Antarctic peninsula, uncovering a part of the sea floor that had not seen sunlight for several thousand years. A ten-week expedition that ended in late January has shed light on the biology of these waters, and has recovered samples of some 1,000 species from the region, several of which may be new to science. \u201cThis is one of the first opportunities to see what will happen when climate change alters the conditions in the polar seas,\u201d says Jesse Ausubel, programme director at the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation in New York. The foundation is funding the Census of Antarctic Marine Life, an initiative for International Polar Year that has 13 voyages scheduled. From the German research vessel  Polarstern , around 50 marine biologists from 14 countries used various approaches, including a remotely operated vehicle equipped with a camera, to scour the depths and trawl for samples. They surveyed an area of seabed roughly the size of Jamaica beneath what used to be the Larsen A and B ice shelves, to a depth of 850 metres. The biologists had two main aims: to discover what kinds of creatures live beneath ice shelves, and to track what happens to those communities once the ice disappears. Unexpected inhabitants of the relatively shallow waters were species more commonly found at greater depth. \u201cWe found a species of sea urchin that has previously been found only at depths of 2,000 to 3,000 metres off Peru,\u201d says Gauthier Chappelle, the expedition's outreach officer and a biologist at the Brussels-based International Polar Foundation. Presumably, such species are better able to adapt to conditions where resources are scarce, as they would have been under the ice. Another find was juvenile forms of glass sponges in the Larsen A region; the Larsen A ice shelf collapsed 12 years ago, whereas the Larsen B region opened up only 5 years ago. Glass sponges take hundreds of years to mature into adults, but are key members of Antarctic marine ecosystems, as they provide habitats for other species. \u201cIt seems like the system is shifting towards supporting the rich communities found in other parts of the Antarctic,\u201d says Julian Gutt, a marine ecologist at the Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research in Bremerhaven, Germany, and chief scientist on the  Polarstern  expedition. It would probably take between 1,000 and 5,000 years for the region to mature into the kind of community typical of Antarctic coastal regions, says Gutt. And future climate change could result in soils from the coast degrading the crystal-clear waters and potentially blocking any further succession to a rich community of Antarctic filter-feeders. \n                     Antarctic waterworks revealed \n                   \n                     Climate change 2007: Data keep flooding in \n                   \n                     Climate change 2007: What we don't know about climate change \n                   \n                     Climate report released \n                   \n                     Drillers get into Antarctic seabed \n                   \n                     Census of Antarctic Marine Life \n                   \n                     International Polar Year \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Molecular geneticist Ronald Plasterk is one of the Netherlands' most highly cited researchers, publishing regularly in top journals in fashionable research fields such as regulation of gene expression by inhibitory RNAs. A lifelong member of the centre-left Labour party, he was last month named minister of research and universities in the country's new coalition government. He talked to  Alison Abbott  about how he ended up in this position. \n               How long have you been active in politics? \n             I was a member of the local council in Leiden in my student days, but then I went to do postdocs at the California Institute of Technology and the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge, UK. I started my family when I returned to the Netherlands, so I was only active in a marginal way. But in the past ten years or so I've been writing a weekly newspaper column and a commentary on TV, whose themes can be political. I also co-authored the Labour party's election platform. \n               What will being research minister mean for your research? \n             I hate to say it, but it will mean the end of research for me. At a meeting only a few weeks ago I was exchanging scientific views with Nobel prizewinners \u2014 you can't step out of this level of research for four years and then hope to go back. It's not yet clear whether I will be able to retain my professorship. \n               How do you feel about that? \n             I feel like Alice, stepping through the mirror into another, slightly unreal, world. I feel a little disconnected right now, but the people in my lab will not suffer. They will be taken care of by others in the institute. \n               What are the key issues for science in the Netherlands? \n             Europe is losing ground \u2014 compared with the United States, for example, from which we have a lot to learn in terms of meritocracy and researcher mobility. Holland is not so bad actually, but it could be, and needs to be, better. The academic system must become less hierarchical. The number of women in top science jobs is embarrassingly low, among the worst in Europe. \n               How can scientific quality be improved? \n             Ask yourself why so many top physicists, including three Nobel prizewinners, ended up in Leiden 100 years ago? Or at the Cavendish laboratories in Cambridge? There is no blueprint for quality \u2014 top scientists will go where they can work best. We just need to provide sufficient funding to allow centres of excellence to emerge from within the community. And there is in fact more money for research foreseen in the government plan. \n                     Ronald Plasterk \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Three groups of researchers claim to have untangled the process by which many Wikipedia entries achieve their impressive accuracy 1 \n, 2 \n, 3 \n. They say that the best articles are those that are highly edited by many different contributors.  Listening to lots of voices rather than a few doesn't always guarantee the success that Wikipedia enjoys \u2014 just think of all those rotten movies written by committee. Collaborative product design in commerce and industry also often generates indifferent results. So why does Wikipedia work where others have failed? Dennis Wilkinson and Bernardo Huberman of Hewlett Packard's research laboratories in Palo Alto, California, addressed the specific question of how Wikipedia's better articles get to be that way. Specifically, do edits by a (largely) unregulated crowd really make an entry better? Right now there are around 6.4 million articles on Wikipedia, generated by over 250 million edits from 5.8 million contributors. Wilkinson and Huberman have studied the editing statistics and found that they don't simply follow the statistical pattern expected from a random process in which each edit is made independently of the others 1 .  \n              Highly edited \n            Instead, there is an abnormally high number of very highly edited entries. The researchers say this is just what is expected if the number of new edits to an article is proportional to the number of previous edits. In other words, edits attract more edits. The disproportionately highly edited articles, the researchers say, are those that deal with very topical issues. And does this increased attention make them better? So it seems. Although the quality of an entry is not easy to assess automatically, Wilkinson and Huberman assume that those articles selected as the 'best' by the Wikipedia user community are indeed in some sense superior. These, they say, are more highly edited, and by a greater number of users, than the less visible entries. Who is making these edits, though? Some have claimed that Wikipedia articles don't truly draw on the collective wisdom of its users, but are put together mostly by a small, select \u00e9lite, including the system's administrators. Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales has admitted that he spends \"a lot of time listening to four or five hundred\" top users. Aniket Kittur of the University of California, Los Angeles, and co-workers have set out to discover who really does the editing 2 . They have looked at 4.7 million pages from the English-language Wikipedia, subjected to a total of about 58 million revisions, to see who was making the changes, and how. The results were striking. In effect, the Wiki community has mutated since 2001 from an oligarchy to a democracy. The percentage of edits made by the Wikipedia '\u00e9lite' of administrators increased steadily up to 2004, when it reached around 50%. But since then it has steadily declined, and is now just 10% (and falling).  \n              Weight of numbers \n            Even though the edits made by this \u00e9lite are generally more substantial than those made by the masses, their overall influence has clearly waned. Wikipedia is now dominated by users who are much more numerous than the elite but individually less active. Kittur and colleagues compare this to the rise of a powerful bourgeoisie within an oligarchic society.  This diversification of contributors is beneficial, Ofer Arazy and colleagues at the University of Alberta in Canada have found 3 . In 2005, when  Nature 's news team arranged for expert comparisons between articles in Wikipedia and Encyclopaedia Britannica online, the experts found only a moderate excess of errors in the Wikipedia articles 4 . (The idea that the two sources were broadly similar was vigorously challenged by the Encyclopaedia Britannica; see  http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v438/n7070/full/438900a.html  and  http://www.nature.com/news/2006/060327/full/440582b.html ) Arazy's team says that of the 42 Wikipedia entries assessed in the article, the number of errors decreased as the number of different editors increased. The main lesson for tapping effectively into the 'wisdom of crowds', then, is that the crowd should be diverse. In fact, in 2004 Lu Hong and Scott Page of the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor showed that a problem-solving team selected at random from a diverse collection of individuals will usually perform better than a team made up of those who individually perform best \u2014 because the latter tend to be too similar, and so draw on too narrow a range of options 5 .

They have worked out the cost of a next-generation particle accelerator; now physicists must sell the dream machine to their governments. At a meeting in Beijing, China, last week, a coalition of physicists set the construction price for the International Linear Collider (ILC) at about US$6.7 billion. That does not include the 22 million hours of labour the job would require, contingency costs or inflation. But the estimate is a first step in convincing governments to build the machine, says Barry Barish, a physicist at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena and head of the design effort. The ILC would be the most powerful particle accelerator in the world. Using superconducting cavities, the 31-kilometre machine would collide electrons and positrons at energies of up to 500 billion electronvolts. The resulting data might help to verify theories of physics beyond the standard model, which currently dominates the field. It would also complement data from the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN, the European particle-physics laboratory near Geneva in Switzerland, which is set to begin operation later this year. But for the ILC to get any further, it must begin to gather political support from the United States, Europe and Japan. That could be tough. The United States has been wary of such projects since cancelling the Superconducting Supercollider in 1993, Europeans are busy finishing the LHC, and the Japanese government remains to be sold on the point of the machine, according to one official at the science ministry. \u201cWe can't provide financial assistance without being convinced about the purpose,\u201d he says. Even putting together a more detailed engineering design, the next step in the process, could be politically fraught. So far, the design work has been done voluntarily with little government money. The engineering phase will require governments to hand over substantial funding to international control, according to Burton Richter, a Nobel laureate and former director of the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center in California. And decisions will have to be made about what components and standards to use. \u201cSomebody's got to have the authority to say 'It's this way, not that way,'\u201d Richter says. \u201cThat gets into some interesting politics.\u201d Where to build the ILC would be an even larger political battle. Europe, the United States and Japan have all shown varying degrees of interest in hosting the machine. In 2004, a similar dispute stalled ITER, a $6-billion experimental fusion reactor, for 18 months. \u201cWe hope not to end up in a situation like ITER,\u201d says Barish, although he points out that the ILC team has yet to solicit official proposals for where to site the accelerator. The ILC's future hinges on what the LHC finds. If the LHC produces exciting results, political support for the ILC will be strong, Richter says. \u201cIf the LHC turns out nothing, I doubt very much that the governments are going to put up the money.\u201d \n                     Fermilab: High-risk physics \n                   \n                     Superconductor beats copper in plans for particle collider \n                   \n                     Physicists rally behind linear-collider plan \n                   \n                     German lab unveils plan to build physicists' next particle collider \n                   \n                     International Linear Collider \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Art collector George Lester Winward acquired this beautiful Madonna and child, now known as the  De Br\u00e9cy Tondo , in 1981 at a country-house sale in England. The more he studied it, the more he became convinced that it was painted by the Renaissance artist Raphael \u2014 not least because of its striking resemblance to Raphael's sixteenth-century  Sistine Madonna  in the Gem\u00e4ldegalerie Alte Meister in Dresden. The art gallery, however, judged it to be a much later copy. So Winward's foundation, the De Br\u00e9cy Trust, sponsored a series of projects to generate evidence for his claim. It closed, not entirely conclusively, this week, with the publication of a laser Raman spectroscopic analysis of three tiny samples taken from the painting. The analysis is consistent with the  De Br\u00e9cy Tondo  being a Renaissance painting. For instance, one sample was shown to contain massicot, a popular yellow Renaissance pigment that was not used after 1700. By ruling out the presence of some alternative chemicals, the analysis also indirectly suggests a starch-based binding medium, commonly used in Renaissance paintings, and the use of the medieval dye turnsole for the blue robes. The presence of eighteenth-century Prussian blue pigment in discrete patches could be explained by recent touching up, says Howell Edwards, the University of Bradford chemist who did the analysis. The trust hopes that these data, together with its convincing provenance research, will help persuade art historians, who rely to a large extent on visual assessment when authenticating paintings, that the work is indeed a Raphael, and thus worth millions. \n                 \u2192  \n                 \n                     http://www.debrecy.org.uk \n                   \n               \n                     Fractals and art: In the hands of a master \n                   \n                     The De Brecy Tondo \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

In 1918, Ronald Aylmer Fisher, an evolutionary biologist and pioneer of modern statistics, published a paper on the genetic causes of disease that brought together two rival factions. Geneticists promoted a paradigm in which diseases worked a lot like Mendel's pea plants, with just one or two genes responsible for each condition. Biometricians, however, advocated a continuous distribution of phenotypes. Fisher suggested that many mendelian traits could result in the continuous distribution of a disease. In doing so, he established the conceptual basis for the search for complex disease genes that continues today. But Fisher's theories had a more immediate impact on animals and agriculture than on medicine \u2014 in people, it's much easier to study and measure mendelian diseases and traits. Even the much-heralded Human Genome Project in the 1990s didn't help as much as expected. The two methods traditionally used to hunt down disease genes are linkage analysis, which uses large family trees to work out which genes are shared by affected individuals, and the candidate-gene approach, which uses physiological clues to narrow down potential culprits. But when it comes to complex conditions such as heart disease or diabetes, in which multiple environmental and genetic factors combine, neither method is very powerful. Scientists have identified just a handful of disease genes, along with lots of weak, unconfirmed hits. Now, after a shaky start, hopes are high that a more ambitious breed of genetics study can finally crack the problem. Modern gene-chip technology combined with recently published maps of human genetic variants \u2014 particularly the 'HapMap' that groups together related variants called single nucleotide polymorphisms \u2014 now enables the entire genomes of thousands of people to be scanned. Many population geneticists and disease researchers think that such genome-wide association (GWA) studies will identify genes that confer even a small extra risk of disease. It has taken time for big GWA studies to be completed. \u201cMany people didn't know how much association studies would deliver,\u201d says Peter Donnelly, a lead investigator of the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium, which began collecting samples for GWA studies in 2005. Yet new results, including a study on type 2 diabetes published this week (R. Sladek  et al .  Nature doi:10.1038/nature05616; 2007 ) suggest that the GWA approach will bear fruit, and lots of it. The group, led by Constantin Polychronakos of McGill University in Quebec, Canada, studied some 393,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms in the genomes of around 700 patients with type 2 diabetes, and 600 controls; the findings were then confirmed in another 14,000 people. The researchers identified four genomic regions that confer a significant risk to developing the disease. Along with the previously identified  TCF7L2  gene, these regions together might account for 70% of the genetic risk for the disease. Of the four new genes, Polychronakos says that the best hit is  SLC30A8 , a zinc transporter, which is important because zinc assists with the packaging and secretion of insulin. The importance of the other hits, which have roles in pancreas development and insulin degradation, are less clear, he says. In general, Polychronakos believes the most likely result of GWA findings will be diagnostic tests that predict who is at high risk of disease. He also envisions using genotypes to determine who would respond to which drugs, in the much-anticipated era of personalized medicine. Drug leads based on gene finds are less likely, Polychronakos thinks. Often, the disease genes uncovered are transcription factors, which he says make poor drug targets. But he does suggest that in the case of the diabetes study the zinc transporter could make a future drug target, or zinc could be used in treatment. Geneticist David Altshuler of the Broad Institute in Cambridge, Massachusetts, is more excited about prospects for new therapies. He cites the case of cholesterol, in which a study of heart disease uncovered gene mutations related to cholesterol, allowing researchers to develop a group of drugs called statins. Either way, the diabetes paper promises to be the first of several big finds. Donnelly says that in the next six months or so, the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium plans to publish genes associated with seven complex diseases, including coronary heart disease and rheumatoid arthritis. The formation of large collaborations focused on particular diseases \u2014 such as the FUSION study for type 2 diabetes \u2014 should help too, allowing researchers to share massive sets of genotype samples. That's not to say that there aren't challenges ahead. If a gene is particularly rare, or if a disease involves dozens of genes that each have a small effect, then even sample sizes of several thousand might not pick up the signal. Donnelly, though, is more optimistic about the promise of the technique than he was three years ago. \u201cThe way I think about it is that some diseases will need much larger studies for us to be convinced of an effect,\u201d he says. Diseases that have a wide variety of symptoms and physiological characteristics, such as schizophrenia, may be more difficult to address. \u201cMy advice: find as homogeneous a phenotype as possible,\u201d says Polychronakos. For example, he and his colleagues excluded obese people from their study so that they could focus on diabetes genes that confer risk independently of obesity. Still, based on the number of papers coming up in 2007, Altshuler expects a major jump in the number of solid leads for disease genes, something neither linkage analysis nor the candidate-gene approach could match. Modern biology may finally have begun to bring technological and scientific rigour to Fisher's decades-old insights. \n                     NIH offers free access to wealth of disease data \n                   \n                     The chips are down \n                   \n                     First phase of HapMap project already helping drug discovery \n                   \n                     Medical research news channel \n                   \n                     The Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium \n                   \n                     FUSION (Finland-United States Investigation of NIDDM Genetics) Study \n                   \n                     NIH archive for genome-wide association study data \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

They describe their observations in  Proceedings of the Royal Society B 1 . Remains of  T. danae   often show up in the stomachs of sperm whales. The squid's flabby flesh led experts to think that it floats in the water column like a neutrally buoyant scuba diver. But the new footage shows it can reach speeds of up to 9 kilometres per hour. When presented with bait, the squid attacked, flashing its luminescent spots, or 'photophores', which contain glowing bacteria.

The Arctic outcrop of Svalbard, just a few hundred miles from the North Pole, might seem like an odd place to install a freezer. But buried deep in the interior of an Arctic mountain, a US$5-million cold storage unit will house duplicate seeds for almost all of the world's estimated 1.5 million crop strains \u2014 protecting them from the ravages of such disasters as war and climate change. The Norwegian government last week unveiled its design for the Svalbard International Seed Vault, nicknamed the 'doomsday vault' by the popular press. Construction should be completed in September, with the first seed deliveries arriving in March 2008. Set at the end of a 120-metre tunnel cut into the freezing rock, where the natural temperature is \u22126 \u00b0C, the facility will be further cooled to \u221218 \u00b0C. \u201cIt will offer the best conditions for seed storage on Earth,\u201d says Cary Fowler, head of the Global Crop Diversity Trust, which will provide the facility's $125,000-a-year operating costs. The vault will even be insulated against climate change, says Fowler. Set 130 metres up the mountainside, it will be able to survive the most catastrophic projected rises in sea level. Despite these precautions, calling the facility a 'doomsday vault' is disingenuous, argues Andreas Graner, who helps to run a seed bank at the Leibniz Institute of Plant Genetics and Crop Plant Research in Gatersleben, Germany. Even with optimal storage, most seeds lose their ability to germinate after about 20 years, so the facility is unlikely to bail out the human race from global disasters that might happen centuries in the future. To keep crop strains for long periods of time, seeds must be regularly grown into plants and a new generation of seeds produced. Although it will take more than a secure vault to save us from a global catastrophe, Fowler says it will act as a \u201cglobal insurance policy\u201d, holding crop strains in the event that banks elsewhere are destroyed by local disasters.

Today, the arguments have switched focus to stem cells, and the research itself is beginning to change tack. \u201cScientists clone adult sheep \u2014 triumph of UK raises alarm over human use,\u201d ran the first headline announcing the cloning of an adult mammal ten years ago this week. Ian Wilmut at the Roslin Institute near Edinburgh and his colleagues at PPL Therapeutics in East Lothian reported on 27 February 1997 that they had produced a lamb named Dolly, born the previous July, that was the first mammalian clone created using the genetic material from an adult cell 1 . As soon as the story hit the front page (the news was broken by a British Sunday newspaper four days ahead of  Nature 's publication), a public and media maelstrom ensued. \u201cThe first press calls came from New Zealand,\u201d recalls Sue Charles of Northbank Communications in London, who was handling publicity for Roslin and PPL at the time. \u201cThey worked their way through Australia, Asia and Europe.\u201d Later in the day, calls began coming in from the United States, with interest ranging from the science involved to politics and religion. \u201cWe even had a US chat show that wanted Dolly on,\u201d says Charles. \u201cThey offered to fly her over.\u201d She remembers that her team, together with Wilmut and his colleagues, took around 2,000 calls from journalists in two weeks. But Dolly wasn't popular with everyone. Pundits warned of a future in which armies of human clones would be created by the evil and egotistical. Conservatives predicted the demise of the nuclear family. Activists cautioned that fertility doctors would perfect the technique and get rich making clones for the infertile, the narcissistic and the eccentric. US President Bill Clinton announced that the feat \u201craises serious ethical questions\u201d and commanded his bioethics advisers to report to him in 90 days on measures he should take to prevent its abuse. Ten years later, the ethical debate launched by Dolly, and encouraged by science-fiction stories, has changed. It has been supplanted by one that is more complex, more rooted in reality and far more relevant to the research that scientists want to do. \u201cWhat didn't happen was the birth of a [cloned] child or a widespread public demand for the use of cloning for reproduction,\u201d says Alta Charo, a professor of law and bioethics at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, who served as a bioethics adviser to Clinton. \u201cWhat did happen was a complete shift in the ethical discussion from reproductive uses of cloning to research uses. And a merging of the cloning debate into the debate around embryonic stem-cell research \u2014 to the disadvantage of both fields because of the attendant confusion.\u201d Back in early 1997, none of Wilmut and his colleagues, the referees who reviewed their paper, or the  Nature  editors who oversaw it, anticipated the huge public reaction to the cloning of Dolly. Scientists in the field saw her birth as an incremental advance \u2014 in large part because one year earlier,  Nature  had published a paper from Wilmut's group reporting the cloning of two lambs, Morag and Megan, using nuclei from embryonic cells 2 . \u201cI always maintained that Dolly was expected and Morag and Megan were truly surprising,\u201d says Davor Solter, director of the Max Planck Institute for Immunobiology in Freiburg, Germany. Solter wrote a News & Views article in  Nature  about the paper on Morag and Megan, suggesting that it was time to start thinking about the implications and uses of cloning mammals from adult cells 3 . Philip Campbell,  Nature 's editor-in-chief, also recalls that the media storm over Dolly took him by surprise. \u201cStaff and referees were aware that this was the paper that in principle demonstrated how to clone mammals, including humans,\u201d he says. \u201cBut neither they nor I anticipated the furore. We were very focused on just how much of an advance it represented on Morag and Megan a year earlier.\u201d But what to scientists was one small step, built on work dating back decades, was to the public the herald of a brave \u2014 and unwelcome \u2014 new world in which human clones would become as common as test-tube babies. The claims that soon followed (of intentions to clone babies, or of having accomplished the deed) from sources including Chicago physicist Richard Seed, Italian embryologist Severino Antinori and the Raelian cult, which believes that the human race was cloned from aliens, only fanned the flames of the public imagination. At the outset, \u201ckooks, cultists and conmen made all the news about cloning\u201d, recalls Arthur Caplan, director of the Center for Bioethics at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. \u201cThis is one of those areas where just trying to rein in nutty behaviour became a full-time job.\u201d But as the decade passed and a menagerie of other mammals was cloned (see ' Cloning timeline '), no cloned human babies appeared. What did occur, and what moved the ethical debate in an unforeseen direction, was the isolation of human embryonic stem-cell lines by James Thomson and his colleagues at the University of Wisconsin, Madison 4 . With that achievement, it became clear that broad research avenues could be opened up by cloning human embryos to extract stem cells from them. These could then be used as disease models and drug targets, or to develop therapies involving tissue transplantation. But as quickly as scientists recognized the potential of such opportunities, political and ethical opponents seized on the notion that allowing cloning in research would only ensure that it would one day be used for reproductive purposes. What's more, they argued, research cloning was a fundamental assault on human dignity, because it creates, manipulates and destroys human embryos for scientific ends. \u201cWhat really took place is that the stem-cell debate replaced the cloning debate,\u201d says Caplan. \u201cBecause there was \u2014 and is \u2014 a tremendous interest in trying to clone embryos, not people.\u201d The South Korean scandal of Seoul National University's Woo Suk Hwang, whose claims to have derived stem-cell lines from cloned human embryos were proved to be fraudulent in 2006, generated plenty of bad press for the field. But there are signs that the new debate is taking a different course from that on reproductive cloning because of the potential of stem-cell research to improve human health. In the United States, for example, opposition to cloning babies has remained firm through a decade of polling, at about 90%, but polls in recent years have shown that 60\u201370% of the public supports research using stem cells obtained from discarded embryos in fertility clinics. \u201cAs people learn about the possibilities for new approaches to disease, they see the embryonic stem-cell issue in a different framework,\u201d says Jonathan Moreno, a bioethicist at the University of Pennsylvania, who co-chaired a committee that crafted 2005 research guidelines for the US National Academies. \u201cThey see it as medical research that could help them or their families.\u201d The notion of cloning embryos to be a source of stem cells \u2014 as opposed to using embryos left over from fertility treatment that are slated for destruction anyway \u2014 is much more controversial. It remains a touchy political issue in many countries, including the United States, and is approached gingerly by public and private funders alike. In the near term, \u201cI rather doubt that we will see very much [cloning] in the context of embryonic stem-cell research in the United States\u201d, says Moreno. But he thinks advances are likely to come in countries where the work is seen as more acceptable, such as Britain, where groups led by Wilmut at the University of Edinburgh and Alison Murdoch at the International Centre for Life in Newcastle upon Tyne have been given permission to pursue it. (Murdoch's group has already cloned at least one human embryo, but has had no luck extracting stem-cell lines.) As embryonic stem-cell research allows the genetic contributions to complex disease to be teased out, Charo believes that the ethical debate will shift again. Rather than focusing on the moral implications of cloning itself, she says, questions of an individual's responsibility for their known predisposition to disease will come to the fore: \u201cIf we move towards genetics research, we will have a new set of issues that  Time  and  Newsweek  can put on their covers.\u201d See  \n                     page 802 \n                    and Editorial,  \n                     page 795 \n                   . \n                     Congress and Bush set to clash on stem cells again \n                   \n                     A long week in stem-cell politics... \n                   \n                     The lure of stem-cell lines \n                   \n                     Seed sows further doubts on cloning \n                   \n                     Nature Web Focus Dolly the Sheep \n                   \n                     Nature News Special Woo Suk Hwang \n                   \n                     Stem Cells in Focus \n                   \n                     THOMAS (Library of Congress) search by bill number HR 3. \n                   \n                     Science responding to fraud \n                   \n                     Sue Charles \n                   \n                     University of Wisconsin Law School Alta Charo \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

San Diego Debate is intensifying at the University of California, Berkeley, over a $500-million energy research partnership with BP. The energy company announced on 1 February that it will fund a decade of alternative-energy research by Berkeley and its partners. But concerns are spreading across the campus about the propriety of the industrial relationship. Some fear that the pact \u2014 for which final details are still being worked out \u2014 could be a repeat of a controversial $25-million contract that the university entered into in 1998 with the biotech giant Novartis (see  Nature   399 , 5; doi:10.1038/19807 1999 ). That deal expired in 2003, amid criticism that the academic freedom of some university researchers had been compromised (see  Nature   426 , 591\u2013594; 2003). Berkeley and its partners, the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, beat four other universities in a six-week competition for cash from the energy company. The research agenda for the initiative has been drawn up by a group of Berkeley researchers. It aims to use biotechnology to develop new energy sources, for example genetically modifying plants for use as fuels, and using enzymes to convert plant material into fuel more efficiently, as well as studying how these new methods might affect agriculture and society. During forthcoming budget negotiations, California's governor Arnold Schwarzenegger plans to push the state for $40 million in bonds to pay for a new building called the Energy Biosciences Institute, where BP-funded researchers would work. The building would house university professors and students, along with perhaps 50 industry scientists. Industry funds a lot of research on public and private university campuses, and it's fairly common for companies to have labs located near institutes where industry and academic researchers work together \u2014 as Intel and Yahoo do at Berkeley, for example. But it's rare for industry to house its scientists in public buildings on state university property. To seasoned industry critics, such as Berkeley entomologist Miguel Altieri, the deal is just one more step in \u201cthe rapid, unchecked and unprecedented global corporate alignment of the world's largest agribusiness, biotech, petroleum and automotive industries\u201d. He fears that for \u201ca relatively small investment\u201d, BP can benefit from public resources and cash in on inventions developed with taxpayers' money. Berkeley's leaders have taken steps to address expected faculty concerns about the deal's impact on campus freedom and intellectual property. Berkeley executives consulted leaders in the Academic Senate early in the bidding process, and the feedback was blunt, says senate chair William Drummond: \u201cNo more Novartis deals.\u201d Drummond says that a senate representative will be closely involved in all negotiations with BP: \u201cWe want to make sure the university's pockets are not picked.\u201d Beth Burnside, Berkeley's vice-chancellor for research, who is helping to negotiate the deal, says that established campus controls will monitor conflicts of interest and issues of intellectual property and academic freedom. BP may have first right of refusal on Berkeley inventions from the collaboration, she says, but licences won't necessarily be exclusive. The new institute will be built conveniently close to another energy-research endeavour, the Helios Project. This will be directed by officials at LBNL, which is a Department of Energy facility managed by the University of California. Helios has been in the pipeline for three years, as part of a shift in LBNL's mission towards renewable-energy projects, but has been unable to secure start-up funding from the Department of Energy. Instead, Schwarzenegger will push the state legislature for $30 million in bonds to pay for the building. More controversially, the BP competition occurred alongside a volatile political campaign in California to create a $4-billion public research programme into alternative energy sources, funded via a severance tax on oil firms. Energy companies spent $108 million on advertisements against the measure, Proposition 87, on last November's ballot. Schwarzenegger refused to back Proposition 87, and critics are upset that, instead, he is supporting a deal that they see as enabling one of those energy companies to benefit from public facilities. Schwarzenegger argues that the BP deal fits California's plans for developing cleaner energy in an economical manner. The losing bidders were the Massachusetts Institute of Technology; the University of California, San Diego; Imperial College London and the University of Cambridge, UK. Imperial's rector Richard Sykes notes that his university had costed its bid so no public funds would be used. He says BP told Imperial that its bid wasn't economical. \u201cWe thought that was interesting,\u201d he comments. Scrutiny of the Energy Biosciences Institute and its mission is likely to continue. \u201cThe debate is going to increase,\u201d says Berkeley physicist Daniel Kammen, who helped write Proposition 87 and the BP proposal. \u201cBut I think this is worth trying.

Four years after Dolly's death, scientists are still amazed she was ever born. That's because the decade since the announcement of Dolly's birth has brought cloning researchers few triumphs and many frustrations. They may have learned a little more about the events that allow an egg to reprogramme the nucleus of an adult cell to produce a new organism. But these advances haven't led to big improvements in the cloning process, or yielded huge commercial payoffs. In many ways, scientists are still fumbling in the dark, says Robert Lanza, vice-president for research and development at Advanced Cell Technology in Worcester, Massachusetts. \u201cWhen Dolly was born, we thought that in a few years we would understand the magic in the egg that allows it to reprogramme a cell's DNA,\u201d Lanza says. \u201cBut cloning is still essentially a black box.\u201d Frogs were cloned as early as 1952, but mammals proved too problematic until scientists at the Roslin Institute in Edinburgh cloned two sheep \u2014 Megan and Morag \u2014 from embryonic cells in 1995. But it was the group's creation of Dolly, cloned from an adult udder cell, that finally overturned the idea that in mammals, developed cells could not reverse their fate. After Dolly, scientists thought they would soon be able to clone many other mammals. Some envisaged an industry of cloning applications, from the production of medicines in live bioreactors \u2014 cloned, genetically modified livestock \u2014 to the creation of herds of cloned food animals. Scientists have made some progress towards potential applications. For instance, they have cloned transgenic pigs that might one day be used as organ donors, transgenic cows and goats that produce proteins that some humans lack \u2014 they have even cloned pets. But the low efficiency of the cloning process has stymied industrial development, and most companies set up to commercialize cloning have shut down. Only 2\u20135% of cloned animal embryos grow into healthy offspring. This is slightly better than a decade ago \u2014 Dolly was the only lamb born from 277 cloned embryos \u2014 but it is still far below the efficiency demanded by industry. There are several reasons why it has been difficult to figure out how cloning works. Early development is slightly different in every species, so cloning a new species is an arduous, trial-and-error process that requires scientists to use thousands of eggs. But eggs aren't always easy to obtain, especially for monkeys and humans, and no clones of either have been born. And even if eggs are available, some of scientists' traditional model species, such as mice, have proved extremely problematic. Yet some see a way ahead. Many of the abnormalities that doom cloned embryos are due to faulty epigenetics \u2014 a set of controls that silences or activates genes by chemically modifying the DNA or by binding it to certain proteins. Epigenetic processes guide young cells with limitless potential into restricted adult fates, by shutting down certain genes. During cloning, an adult nucleus is transplanted into an egg, which must then erase the adult genome's epigenetic marks, so it can re-express every gene necessary to build a new animal. But requiring an egg to do this reprogramming on its own bypasses other natural mechanisms that normally help reset a cell's epigenetic programme. Perhaps it's not surprising that the egg doesn't always do a perfect job, says Ian Wilmut, Dolly's creator and director of the Scottish Center for Regenerative Medicine at the University of Edinburgh. \u201cWhen you think about what we're asking the egg to do for us, in a way, I think we should still be surprised that cloning works at all,\u201d Wilmut says. Rudolf Jaenisch, a biologist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research, is among those trying to decipher these epigenetic glitches. If they can understand what goes wrong with the reprogramming, they may be able to fix it \u2014 or, better yet, initiate the process themselves by adding chemicals or proteins to adult cell nuclei. This would allow scientists to bypass the need for eggs altogether. The field is moving in this direction, trying to find ways to reprogramme cells without using eggs. Last summer, for instance, Shinya Yamanaka and Kazutoshi Takahashi from Kyoto University in Japan used a cocktail of proteins to turn adult mouse cells into more flexible cells that behave a lot like stem cells (K. Takahashi and S. Yamanaka  Cell   126,  663\u2013676; 2006). This molecular approach solves the efficiency problem and avoids society's ethical qualms about cloning (see  page 800 ). \u201cFor many of us, that is the holy grail, and nuclear transplantation is an intermediate stage,\u201d says Alan Colman, chief executive of Singapore-based company ES Cell International and former research director at PPL Therapeutics, which contributed to the Dolly paper. Egg-free approaches may also enable what many see as the most promising potential application of cloning: the creation of human embryonic stem cells, or cells made from them, that could be used to treat human disease. Many scientists see human embryonic stem cells as having the most potential for the next decade, especially if scientists learn to reprogramme cells without using eggs. \u201cI think in ten years, people will learn how to convert one cell type to another, without nuclear transfer, without eggs, in a Petri dish,\u201d says Jaenisch. \u201cOnce we learn all the rules, maybe one day it will be possible.\u201d \n                     Simple recipe gives adult cells embryonic powers \n                   \n                     Cloning: Mining the secrets of the egg \n                   \n                     Ethicists and biologists ponder the price of eggs \n                   \n                     Stem cells in focus \n                   \n                     Nature news special Woo Suk Hwang \n                   \n                     Nature Web Focus Dolly the sheep \n                   \n                     Science Museum \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Tokyo For scientists who speak to the mass media about their research, a scandal surrounding a Japanese television show demonstrates just how badly things can go wrong. Kansai Telecasting Corporation (KTV) has admitted that it faked scientific results in one of its programmes, and used dubbing to put false words into the mouths of foreign researchers. After an outcry from the Japanese media, the company has cancelled the series and is reviewing all 520 episodes. One of the victims is Dr Kim, a professor at a US university who studies soya bean fermentation. He spoke to  Nature  but asked that his first name and affiliation be withheld. He was interviewed by KTV about his research in January 2006. When he finally watched that programme this month, he was horrified. The show \u2014 and Kim \u2014 trumpeted the health benefits of a fermented bean paste called  miso . \u201cThey made it look like I said many things that I didn't. About 60% of the content was not correct,\u201d he says. Hakkutsu: Aruaru Daijiten II  (which roughly translates as \u201cExcavation: an encyclopedia of facts\u201d) was a popular weekly show broadcast for ten years by the Fuji Television Network and watched in around 15% of Japanese homes. Presented as a science documentary, the show covered food and health-related topics and was based on interviews with scientists. The scandal broke after the broadcast on 7 January, which claimed that eating  natto , a pungent dish made from fermented soya beans, can help you lose weight. When the Japanese media raised questions, KTV investigated, and on 20 January released a statement admitting that most of the data in the programme had been fabricated. Photos of slimmed-down people were not of the experimental subjects, and the claimed measurements of reduced fat levels had never been made. KTV admitted that it had used Japanese dubbing to put words into the mouth of US researcher Arthur Schwartz of Temple University in Philadelphia. In the 7 January programme, Schwartz appeared to say that isoflavone, a compound in soya beans, can increase the body's levels of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), a naturally occurring hormone said to have various health benefits. Experiments portrayed as having been carried out by Schwartz were actually those of another researcher. Schwartz, who is studying the ability of DHEA to slow the progression of age-related diseases, did not respond to  Nature 's request for an interview, but a university spokeswoman confirmed that \u201cstatements were wrongly attributed to Dr Schwartz and his research was falsely represented\u201d. Other incidents have since come to light, including the episode of  Aruaru  that changed Kim's words. \u201cIt looks like I am saying that  miso  can make you thin and even that it has certain neurological effects,\u201d Kim says. He had actually been explaining why fermenting soya beans makes them more easily digestible and useful as animal feed. \u201cI spent a half-day taking them round my laboratory and showing them results. They understood what I was doing,\u201d he says. Scientific impropriety has been traced back to the early days of the show. In 1998,  Aruaru  asked Yoichi Nagamura of the Chiba Institute of Science, who researches the soporific effects of tryptophan, to run an experiment investigating whether lettuce makes mice sleepy. Nagamura and the KTV production crew fed lettuce extract to some mice and watched them for two hours. \u201cI was hoping to be on TV, and I hoped the mice would fall asleep,\u201d he says. But he and the crew agreed that there was no noticeable effect. So Nagamura was surprised when he saw the programme show one of his mice, declaring: \u201cIt's fallen asleep!\u201d Makoto Tajima, a nutrition researcher at Jissen Women's University in Tokyo, then appeared explaining that lactucopicrin, a chemical found in wild lettuce, and in trace amounts in cultivated lettuce, can induce sleep. \u201cThe programme left the impression that eating three leaves of lettuce can knock you out,\u201d says Nagamura. Tajima says he's never carried out any experiments with lettuce, but that he gave accurate information from the scientific literature. He says he felt \u201ca little uncomfortable\u201d explaining another scientist's results, but wasn't too concerned: \u201cWe're used like TV personalities, I say what the programme wants me to.\u201d Tajima adds that he has appeared on more than 500 television programmes to explain nutrition. \u201cIf I didn't do it, they'd get someone worse.\u201d Nagamura says he didn't complain to the production or broadcasting companies, because \u201cit was too ridiculous\u201d. But he expressed his misgivings about the show at academic conferences and public talks. \u201cMany scientists would say that  Aruaru  is dodgy, but nothing happened until now,\u201d he says. Newspaper editorials in Japan are questioning a TV culture in which 'infotainment' is increasingly popular, and contract production companies are chasing ratings, particularly for shows on health and beauty. Aruaru  was cancelled in January because of the scandal, and KTV has asked an independent committee to review all its episodes. It is due to report in mid-March. A 2004 show about the 'science of face-thinning' and a 2001 show about the power of adzuki beans to invigorate the brain are reportedly getting close attention. Tomohiro Takeuchi, assistant chief of the terrestrial broadcasting division of Japan's internal affairs and communications ministry, says that KTV has technically broken the country's communications law, which prohibits \u201cperversion of the truth\u201d, and that his division is waiting for an internal report from KTV, due by the end of February, to decide what action to take. But the ministry's only options are to revoke KTV's broadcasting licence, which Takeuchi says is generally thought too harsh, or censure by \u201cadministrative directive/guidance\u201d. The stricter penalty has never been applied, and the lesser one in only a few cases. Last year another production company was censured after one of its programmes on how to parch white navy beans for most effective weight loss led to viewers being poisoned. Earlier this month, the minister of internal affairs and communications called for the next parliament to add other measures, stricter than a directive but less harsh than revoking the licence, to prevent bogus reporting. Kuniko Takahashi, a nutrition researcher at Gunma University in Maebashi City, says the problem is widespread in Japan. Since 2000 she has been following programmes that combine health and nutrition with entertainment, and has found exaggeration and some dangerous mistakes. \u201cThey should all be treated with suspicion,\u201d she says. Nevertheless, she worries about the proposed law change. \u201cIt would let the government tell us what was right and wrong,\u201d she says. \u201cIn the end, we'll have to depend on the morals of the people in the industry.\u201d On 26 January, Ichiro Kanazawa, a neurologist and president of the Science Council of Japan, issued a statement saying that the council's guidelines on academic fraud should apply to anyone doing experiments, even for television shows. He's not optimistic the guidelines will be followed by TV companies, however. \u201cTheir goal is not scientific truth; it's ratings,\u201d he says. \u201cThey are under tremendous pressure.\u201d Cases as blatant as  Aruaru  are rare, but the temptation to wow an audience at the expense of scientific integrity is not confined to Japan. Last year,  Brainiac: Science Abuse , a popular UK science series, admitted that in an episode claiming to show a bathtub of water being blown up by caesium and rubidium, explosives were used instead. Sky One, the channel that broadcast the series, released a statement saying that although it consulted with scientists when planning stunts, its priority in executing them was entertainment. \u201cIf you're expecting to see the Open University, you're on the wrong channel!\u201d it said. Both Kim and Nagamura are now wary of any media. When consenting to be interviewed by  Nature , Kim insisted he saw how he was going to be quoted: \u201cThat is what I learned from the  Aruaru  experience.\u201d \n                     news in brief \n                   \n                     Magic beans \n                   \n                     Kansai Telecasting Corporation \n                   \n                     Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Three groups of astronomers have made the first detailed measurements of radiation emitted by two exoplanets. Although sketchy, the results hint that the worlds are cloaked in black silicate clouds that don't let light in or out. After a bitter race, Jeremy Richardson at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, and his colleagues are the first to publish their results (see  'Crossing the line' ). They used the Spitzer Space Telescope to analyse the atmosphere of a hot Jupiter-like planet called HD 209458b, 150 light years from Earth, and announce their results in this week's  Nature  (see  page 892 ). Previous studies used the Hubble Space Telescope to look for wavelengths of starlight that are absorbed when HD 209458b passes in front of its parent star, and have deduced the presence of sodium, as well as possibly carbon and oxygen, in its atmosphere (D. Charbonneau  et al .  Astrophys. J.   568,  377\u2013384; 2002; A. Vidal-Madjar  et al .  Astrophys J.   604,  L69\u2013L72; 2004). But Richardson's group used the Spitzer Space Telescope to detect the planet's atmosphere directly, by comparing the infrared radiation from the star and planet together, with that emitted when the planet was behind the star. Molecules absorb and emit infrared radiation at specific wavelengths when they vibrate, and the researchers had expected the planet's infrared spectrum to show up water and carbon dioxide, as well as carbon-containing molecules such as methane. But Richardson says that the spectrum was flat, showing nothing apart from a peak he attributes to silicates, and possibly a molecule containing carbon\u2013carbon bonds such as those seen in benzene. The absence of water was particularly surprising because gas giants such as HD 209458b are predicted to produce large quantities of water. \u201cTheorists will tell you that water has to be there,\u201d Richardson says. He thinks that the silicates might provide an explanation. Previous observations of the planet have suggested the presence of high clouds, so it's possible that the silicate clouds are blocking the water, and other chemicals, from Spitzer's gaze. Carl Grillmair at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena and his colleagues used Spitzer to measure the atmospheric spectrum of a similar planet 60 light years from Earth, called HD 189733b. They weren't far behind Richardson in their analysis, and their full results will soon be unveiled in the  Astrophysical Journal . Grillmair's group also got a flat spectrum, with no water, methane or carbon dioxide. The team didn't see silicates either, but co-author David Charbonneau from the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge, Massachusetts, says that Richardson's result offers a tantalizing clue to what might be going on. \u201cWe find it hard to believe that there isn't water because it is so easy to make,\u201d he says. Mark Swain at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California, offers a third perspective. He started working on Richardson's data once they were made public a year after they were collected, and has submitted his results to the  Astrophysical Journal . For now he is keeping the details to himself, but he says that he didn't see any water or silicates and isn't convinced by Richardson's idea of silicate clouds. \u201cThat's not a conclusion I would sign up to,\u201d he says. All three groups have applied to make follow-up observations with Spitzer. Theorist Alan Boss of the Carnegie Institute in Washington DC says that it's not surprising that the researchers didn't see what they expected first time round. In exoplanet research, with so few data to go on, theory must follow observations as they are made, he points out. \u201cIt would have been a miracle if theorists had been able to predict what the spectrum of these two hot Jupiters would be like.\u201d \n                     Planet hunt ready for lift-off \n                   \n                     Found: one Earth-like planet \n                   \n                     Rocky planet found outside Solar System \n                   \n                     Light from alien planets confirmed \n                   \n                     Distant starlight reveals alien atmosphere \n                   \n                     Nature Highlights Extrasolar planets: Disk worlds \n                   \n                     The extrasolar planets encyclopedia \n                   \n                     Spitzer Space Telescope \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Many climate scientists get frustrated with those who don't believe that human activity is causing global warming, but should having such views be a sackable offence? In recent months, two US state climatologists have been asked to stand down from their posts because of it, triggering debate about whether personal views should determine suitability for what many see as an academic position. Almost all US states have their own climatologist, who runs a small office concerned with meteorological matters of local interest. Earlier this month, Oregon governor Ted Kulongoski said that he wants to strip Oregon's climatologist George Taylor of his title for not agreeing that global warming is predominantly caused by humans. Taylor, based at Oregon State University in Corvallis and appointed to his post in 1991, argues that his post is academic rather than political, and that it's not his job to tell the state government what to do. \u201cMost state climatologists have never even met their governor, let alone offered policy advice,\u201d he told  Nature . Therefore, he says, his personal views on climate change shouldn't be an issue. But Kulongoski clearly believes that a state climatologist should represent the state, and he argues that Taylor's views are inconsistent with Oregon's goal of cutting greenhouse-gas emissions. \u201cHe is Oregon State University's climatologist,\u201d Kulongoski said in a television interview on 8 February. \u201cHe is not the state of Oregon's climatologist.\u201d Patrick Michaels, Virginia's climatologist since 1980, faces a similar situation. An environmental scientist at the University of Virginia, he does not agree that taking action to cut greenhouse-gas emissions is an urgent priority. Last August, he received a letter from the office of the governor, Timothy Kaine, asking him not to use the title any more. Most state climate offices, like those of Michaels and Taylor, are based at state universities, although a few are directly within state government. Thirty-four of the state climatological offices are officially recognized by the American Association of State Climatologists (AASC), which sets standards for state climate offices, but cannot bestow or remove 'state climatologist' status. To qualify for AASC recognition, an office must make its data public, set up educational initiatives and work with the media. It must also monitor climate conditions, place them in historical context and assess possible future impacts on the climate. The role is somewhere between that of a meteorologist and a climate modeller, and state climatologists are concerned only with their own state. Residents of New Jersey, for example, can thank their state climatologist David Robinson for the knowledge that they have just encountered their warmest December since records began in 1895. So grand ideas about the need to tackle global warming aren't the main focus, says Mark Shafer, a climate officer who works with Oklahoma state climatologist and former AASC president Ken Crawford. Although stopping short of saying that state climatologists shouldn't be sacked for their views on global warming, he points out that they generally deal with questions to which those views aren't relevant \u2014 for example, the impact of human actions on shorter-term climate effects such as drought. The AASC is now preparing a statement in response to the controversy, urging state governors to consider the factors most important for a successful state climate office. \u201cWe encourage public officials to enter into a direct dialogue with their respective state climatologists in order to resolve any differences of opinion,\u201d says a draft of the letter, seen by  Nature . Shafer says there are roughly a dozen prospective signatories so far. Many state climatologists are unhappy about the growing importance of global climate issues on their agenda, however, and the way state climatologists' views on global warming (particularly those of the sceptics) are increasingly sought by the media. Taylor points out that the role initially grew from the National Weather Service in the 1950s, and has always been more closely akin to a weather information service. \u201cClimatologists must be knowledgeable about climate change, but that is usually only a very small part of what we do,\u201d he argues. All of which moves the debate towards a different question. As the priorities of a state change, should those of its climatologist? \n                     American Association of State Climatologists \n                   \n                     Oregon State Climate Service \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

This article is part of Nature's Climate Change 2007 special. The 4th Assessment Report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has a finely calibrated lexicon of certainty. \u201cVirtually certain\u201d, it blares when it assigns a 99% probability to hot days getting hotter and more frequent. \u201cVery likely\u201d, or more than 90% probable, are heavier rains. And so on down the list \u2014 including the wishy-washy \u201cmore likely than not\u201d when assigning a greater than 50% probability, such as the chance that human activities are affecting the intensity of hurricanes. Such care is crucial in a field that is still, in some areas, shot through with uncertainty. The IPCC has gone far in tightening up some key scientific unknowns about climate change (see  page 578 ), but many still remain. Some conclusions \u2014 such as the effect on particular regions of the world, or exactly how much sea level will rise \u2014 remain more uncertain than others. This means that there's plenty of work left for the climate scientists on whom the IPCC process depends. Perhaps most critically, researchers know relatively little about feedback effects that might enhance \u2014 or weaken \u2014 the pace and effects of climate change. The complex flow of carbon between soils, plants, the oceans and the atmosphere is still being pinned down by large-scale climate experiments. Some experts predict that, in a warmer world, ecosystems that are currently sinks for carbon, such as the Arctic tundra, may turn into carbon sources. But no one can yet accurately predict how this might pan out, and feedbacks among land and air could end up putting far more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere than currently forecast. Other big unknowns are the effects of the take-up of carbon dioxide by the oceans, which removes the gas from the atmosphere and locks it away in the calcium carbonate of the shells and skeletons of marine organisms. Higher levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide are expected to make the seas more acidic and slow down the rate of calcification, ultimately reducing the ocean's ability to absorb more carbon dioxide. But precisely how the biology of marine creatures would play into that effect is unknown. Nor is it known how changes in plankton composition and coral reefs, for example, might affect carbon dioxide concentrations. Pinning down biological feedbacks will be critical for future reports, says Richard Bellerby, a chemical oceanographer at the Bjerknes Center for Climate Research in Bergen, Norway. \u201cWe're going blindly into the future,\u201d he says. Another major source of uncertainty \u2014 and of debate at the Paris meeting where the IPCC report was finalized \u2014 is the rise in sea level. In 2001, the IPCC predicted a rise of between 9 and 88 millimetres by 2100, as a result of melting ice caps and the thermal expansion of the ocean. This time around, the group has narrowed that range to between 19 and 58 centimetres. But some scientists say that this is an underestimate. Stefan Rahmstorf, an oceanographer at the Potsdam Institute of Climate Impact Research in Germany, believes, for instance, that global sea level could rise by much more than that. In a paper published online the day before the IPCC report's release, Rahmstorf and his colleagues argue that sea-level rises will be close to the worst-case predictions of climate models (S. Rahmstorf  et al .  Science  doi:10.1126/science.1136843; 2007). \u201cIf anything, the IPCC has been conservative,\u201d he says. Key sticking points include the inability of global climate models to produce the amount of sea-level rise observed over the past couple of decades and whether ice flow at the bases of glaciers is accelerating or not. How volatile Antarctic and Greenland glaciers might become in a warmer world is therefore pretty much guesswork. For the first time, the IPCC report predicts how changing climate might affect particular regions of the world. But these forecasts are only in their infancy, modellers warn. For some areas, models predict specific and well understood effects, such as hotter summers in Spain and smaller snowpacks (the accumulation of snow each season) in the Rocky Mountains in the United States. But improved analyses that incorporate clouds, snow and ice into the models must be developed if regional predictions are to become more accurate, says Rasmus Benestad, a climate modeller at the Norwegian Meteorological Institute in Oslo. Extreme weather is another example of the remaining uncertainties. Climate researchers believe that storms and heavy rainfall will become more frequent as the planet warms. But pinning down where and when that might happen is not so simple. In the tropics, rising sea-surface temperatures can be linked in a relatively straightforward manner to storm formation, and the case for more intense storms seems more or less settled. But in the mid-latitudes, where atmospheric processes are more complex, some climate models predict more storms whereas others do not. Improving the models, experts say, requires better data. Gaps and errors in observations are attributable to many causes: snowfall gauges that ice up, oceanographic floats that get lost, and changeovers in satellites that throw off carefully calibrated trends, to name but a few. Cloud and storm records urgently need to be reprocessed using uniform techniques, says Kevin Trenberth, a senior scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colorado, and coordinating lead author of the report's chapter on surface and atmospheric change. \u201cThe IPCC report is a consensus report, and one that develops over nearly three years,\u201d he says. \u201cThis means that it is not the leading \u2014 or bleeding \u2014 edge of the science.\u201d \n                     How much will it cost to save the world? \n                   \n                     The costs of global warming \n                   \n                     US posts sensitive climate report for public comment \n                   \n                     Climate Change In Focus \n                   \n                     Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

The 2007 report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) represents the work of thousands of researchers, compiled and summarized by hundreds of climatologists. Nominally, the cut-off for inclusion in the assessment was the end of 2005, allowing a year for the panel to make sense of the vast tracts of data. But notable research arising after that date will not have escaped attention. Here is a round-up of some of the most prominent studies. \n               Greenland ice \n               Greenland is losing ice at an ever-increasing rate, according to data from the GRACE gravity-measuring satellite (J. L. Chen, C. R. Wilson & B. D. Tapley  Science   313,  1958\u20131960; 2006). \n               Antarctic air \n             Weather balloons reveal that the troposphere above Antarctica has warmed by 0.5\u20130.7 \u00b0C per decade over the past 30 years, although it is not clear why (J. Turner, T. A. Lachlan-Cope, S. Colwell, G. J. Marshall & W. M. Connolley  Science   311,  1914\u20131917; 2006). \n               Established forests \n             Old forests keep soaking up atmospheric carbon long after they reach maturity, according to measurements from China. Soil carbon in a forest reserve in Guangdong increased by 68% in 25 years (G. Zhou  et al .  Science   314,  1417; 2006). \n               Atlantic currents \n             The Gulf Stream, which brings heat from the tropics to the North Atlantic, weakened by 10% between 1200 and 1850, during the cold spell known as the Little Ice Age. The authors suggest that this demonstrates the link between this ocean current and temperatures in northern Europe (D. C. Lund, J. Lynch-Stieglitz & W. B. Curry  Nature   444 , 601\u2013604; 2006). \n               Atlantic hurricanes \n             Rising sea-surface temperatures correlate strongly with the observed increase in the number of category 4 and 5 Atlantic hurricanes between 1970 and 2004. Other factors that affect hurricane formation, such as wind shear, do not seem to have increased in line with the upward trend (C. D. Hoyos, P. A. Agudelo, P. J. Webster & J. A. Curry  Science   312,  94\u201397; 2006). \n               River runoff \n             More carbon dioxide in the atmosphere leads to plants losing less water by transpiration, a model suggests. This could affect the amount of fresh water available for human use. (N. Gedney  et al .  Nature   439 , 835\u2013838; 2006). \n               Polar temperatures \n             Bubbles dating back 150,000 years in an Antarctic ice core show that warming events have tended to seesaw back and forth between the poles (EPICA Community Members  Nature 444, 195\u2013198; 2006 ). \n               Ocean temperatures \n             The upper layers of the oceans cooled, on average, between 2003 and 2005. Factoring in this downturn, the rate of warming in these layers between 1993 and 2005 was equivalent to 0.33 watts per square metre over the whole of the planet's surface (J. M. Lyman, J. K. Willis & G. C. Johnson  Geophys. Res. Lett.   33,  L18604; 2006). \n               Sea levels \n             If the rate of sea-level rise is proportional to the global rise in temperature since pre-industrial times, sea levels could rise by up to 1.4 metres by 2100 (S. Rahmstorf  Science   315,  368\u2013370; 2007). \n                     Climate sceptics place bets on world cooling down \n                   \n                     Climate argument solved? \n                   \n                     Climatologists get real over global warming \n                   \n                     The man they love to hate \n                   \n                     Climate change in focus \n                   \n                     Earth and environment news \n                   \n                     Physics news \n                   \n                     Policy news \n                   \n                     Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

This article is part of Nature's Climate Change 2007 special. Reports by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) are held out as a model of consensus science, with thousands of international scientists coming together to present the most detailed look ever at a single scientific topic. Yet a consensus among most of the world's researchers does not mean that everybody agrees. \u201cI am one of the 2,000 with their names on [the assessment], but don't sign me up for that catastrophic view of climate change,\u201d says John Christy, a climatologist at the University of Alabama in Huntsville and a contributing author to the report. And outside the IPCC process there remains a dwindling band of climate sceptics, those who argue that global warming is not linked to human activity and that it would be rash to take drastic action to cut carbon emissions. The focus of these arguments, however, has shifted noticeably since the previous IPCC report was published six years ago. Many of the scientific uncertainties the sceptics have seized on are no more. \u201cTheir argument continues to shift,\u201d says Naomi Oreskes, a geologist and science historian at the University of California, San Diego. \u201cThat makes it clear that the issue for them is not the science. Whatever the science is, they will try to find ways to question it.\u201d The previous IPCC report, for instance, gained infamy for featuring in its summary for policymakers the 'hockey stick' palaeotemperature graph. This shows a sharp rise in temperatures at the end of the last millennium that forms the blade of the hockey stick. Sceptics, notably economist Ross McKitrick of the University of Guelph in Canada and minerals consultant Steven McIntyre, have spent years working to discredit the statistical analysis and temperature proxies that were used to create the graph. But a host of other studies, including a 2006 review by the US National Academy of Sciences, has reaffirmed that the past decade has seen an unprecedented rise in global temperatures. \u201cThis is just one of many lines of evidence,\u201d Michael Mann of Pennsylvania State University in University Park told an audience of congressional aides in Washington DC last week. Mann is the originator of one version of the graph. Another key argument for sceptics has been the apparent discrepancy between warming at Earth's surface and temperatures in Earth's lower atmosphere, which satellite records suggested have cooled over the past several decades. But in 2005, a major US report, commissioned specifically to look into this question, concluded that the original data had been analysed incorrectly, and when corrected do indeed show a slight warming. Other favourite arguments of climate sceptics are also dismantled in the latest IPCC report. Urban heat islands \u2014 the fact that cities tend to heat the air above them \u2014 do exist, the report says, but have a negligible effect on global temperatures. And solar variability \u2014 natural fluctuations in the amount of the Sun's radiation reaching Earth \u2014 does affect climate, but to a far smaller extent than the burning of fossil fuels. With less to argue about on the scientific front, climate sceptics have been turning their attention to the economics of adapting to a changing climate. Christy believes that fostering innovation is the way to decrease reliance on fossil fuels. \u201cWe're going to look back in a century and say 'wasn't it quaint, we burned carbon',\u201d he says. \u201cI'm very optimistic; I see the wealth of the Earth continuing to rise. But suppressing energy is not the way. Keep energy inexpensive and affordable and allow people to do research.\u201d As for the Kyoto Protocol on climate change, the international agreement to reduce carbon emissions, Christy calls it \u201csinister\u201d. Economic arguments also play a strong role in the views of sceptic Patrick Michaels, an environmental scientist at the University of Virginia who argues that taking action on climate change can have dire economic consequences. He sees the current US move towards embracing biofuel as causing corn prices to surge, triggering inflation and leaving many poor people, particularly in Mexico, struggling to buy food. \u201cSmall changes in policy can lead to a recession,\u201d he says. It remains to be seen whether these arguments will gain much traction. Alan Thorpe of Britain's Natural Environment Research Council, which hosted an online debate to canvass climate sceptics on their views, says that such views range from lazy to devious. \u201cI think there is a degree to which there is mischievous use of scepticism,\u201d he says. \u201cSceptics want to accuse scientific society of wanting a particular policy outcome, but actual policy is up to governments.\u201d \n                     Climate sceptics place bets on world cooling down \n                   \n                     Climate argument solved? \n                   \n                     Climatologists get real over global warming \n                   \n                     The man they love to hate \n                   \n                     Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change \n                   \n                     National Environment Research Council \n                   \n                     The Cato Institute \n                   \n                     Science and Environmental Policy Project \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

So what next for the IPCC? Helping policymakers decide what to do now may require radical reform, reports Jim Giles. This article is part of Nature's Climate Change 2007 special. The disturbing predictions about global warming in the latest report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) mark a turning point. That's not because of the figures themselves, which are largely in line with previous IPCC forecasts, but because the science behind them is now certain enough to make a serious response from policymakers almost inevitable. The debate is no longer about whether we can believe the numbers, but what we should do about them. And so the report, released in Paris on 2 February (see  'Behind the scenes' ), may be the harbinger of another change. As the debate evolves, say climate researchers, so must the IPCC. Many now feel that its weighty structure \u2014 the latest report has more than 1,200 authors and reviewers \u2014 is no longer useful. If the panel is to guide policymakers in the future, it must slim down, and become more focused on producing data that politicians can use. \u201cThe IPCC needs a complete overhaul,\u201d says Mike Hulme, director of the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research in Norwich, UK. \u201cThe structure and process are past their sell-by dates.\u201d This might seem contrary, given the panel's enormous influence. But the proposed shift is partly a recognition of the success that climate scientists and the IPCC have had in revealing the scale of the problem. The latest report, the panel's fourth, is peppered with predictions classified as \u201chighly likely\u201d and \u201cunequivocal\u201d. It notes with over 90% certainty that recent temperature increases are driven by human activity, and describes detailed impacts in more places than ever before, from melting ice sheets to shifting wind patterns. Some of that confidence comes from the accuracy of previous IPCC predictions, such as estimates made from 1990 onwards, that global temperatures would rise by between 0.15 \u00b0C and 0.3 \u00b0C per decade. Temperatures have climbed steadily since: the ten hottest years on record all postdate 1990, and the rate of warming, 0.2 \u00b0C per decade, fits the initial prediction. More sophisticated models and mounting observational data have also reinforced simulations of future climate. For example, the new report is the first to go into detail on how warming will affect the carbon cycle. The previous report, released in 2001, was unable to say whether rising temperatures would further increase atmospheric carbon levels by speeding up the decay of organic matter in soils, or cut levels by promoting plant growth. It's now clear that the former effect dominates, says Peter Cox, a climate modeller and IPCC author based at the University of Exeter, UK. \u201cAll the models give positive feedback.\u201d The report is the first to give a best estimate \u2014 3 \u00b0C \u2014 of 'climate sensitivity': the global mean temperature rise resulting from a doubling of carbon dioxide levels. The range of possible values has also been tightened, to 2.0\u20134.5 \u00b0C. This feeds into predictions of the temperature increase over this century, which is now given as 1.1\u20136.4 \u00b0C, compared with 1.4\u20135.8 \u00b0C last time. Where we end up on that scale will depend mostly on how much fossil fuel the world burns. \u201cThe report is an unequivocal set of evidence on how we are affecting our planet,\u201d concludes Achim Steiner, executive director of the United Nations Environment Programme. \u201cThe focus of attention must now shift to what we are going to do about it.\u201d In the short term, attention will focus on further IPCC publications. The working group behind the current report looked only at the physical basis of climate change, but the IPCC has two other working groups that focus on the impact of climate change and what can be done about it. These will issue their 2007 conclusions in April and May, respectively. After that, the decision about what to do rests with politicians. And if climate scientists are to inform those decisions they may need to reform the IPCC. Publishing coordinated and lengthy assessments at six-yearly intervals makes it difficult for authors to deliver timely advice and deters those from different working groups from collaborating. That's a problem, says Jonathan Overpeck, an IPCC author and palaeoclimatologist at the University of Arizona, Tucson, because producing research that can inform policy requires social and natural scientists to work together. For example, the new report contains detailed regional predictions, such as that the western United States will warm on average by 5 \u00b0C by 2100. Such predictions will be needed regularly in the future, says Overpeck, and must include details such as the impacts on agriculture and water resources. Hulme agrees, adding that as the emphasis shifts from talk to action, IPCC reports will need to come in regular \u201cdigestible chunks\u201d for policymakers. Climate modellers must also aim to produce information that can inform policy directly, says Kevin Trenberth, a climate researcher at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colorado. That means filling the gap between long-term simulations looking decades ahead and weather forecasts, to provide predictions for the next 20 or so years. \u201cSome of what is in the research domain needs to become operational,\u201d argues Trenberth. Rajendra Pachauri, chair of the IPCC, says he will circulate a document on possible reforms in the next couple of months, adding that he supports the suggestions made by the report's authors. Any change needs the approval of the political representatives who sit on the IPCC plenary and meet once or twice a year. But some urge caution. The IPCC already produces reports from across the working groups, such as its 2005 study on carbon capture and storage, points out Halldor Thorgeirsson, a deputy executive secretary at the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, the body that oversees the Kyoto Protocol. And the IPCC process drives research \u2014 because climate modellers pool resources when a report is coming up. That informs all three working groups. \u201cWe can't allow the scientific activities that underpin the assessments to dry up,\u201d says Thorgeirsson. \n                 See Editorial,  \n                 \n                     page 567 \n                   \n               \n                     How much will it cost to save the world? \n                   \n                     US posts sensitive climate report for public comment \n                   \n                     The costs of global warming \n                   \n                     Climate Change In Focus \n                   \n                     Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

African heads of state and ministers ended their summit in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, on 30 January amid a blaze of initiatives on education, science and sustainable development \u2014 once they had stopped talking about football. Decisions made at the three-day summit of the 53-member African Union (AU) include plans for three new funding agencies, an Africa-wide system of intellectual-property protection, and a 20-year strategy for biotechnology. Africa's leaders also asked the AU secretariat to produce an assessment of alternative energy sources in the continent, particularly biofuels, before their next meeting in July. The meeting was driven by the AU's science team, headed by Nagia Essayed, and the head of her secretariat, Botlhale Tema. By lunchtime on the first day, both women were looking dejected. The themes of science and the environment had been overshadowed by the glitzy launch that morning of the International Year of African Football. Television coverage of the summit, moreover, focused on political conflicts between member states and disagreements over the election of the AU's chair. During lunch, Essayed sat with several science ministers and their advisers to discuss how to steer the presidents back to the summit's main business. Calestous Juma, co-chair of the AU's biotechnology advisory panel, had a light-hearted suggestion to link science and football: \u201cCountries that export soccer balls need to have expertise in precision engineering.\u201d But the breakthrough happened the following morning when Nicholas Stern, economic adviser to the UK government and author of an influential report on climate change, gave a speech on the causes and effects of climate change. This provoked an angry response from several presidents, including Yoweri Museveni of Uganda and Blaise Compaor\u00e9 of Burkina Faso, who saw it as a hypocritical lecture on how to be clean from a representative of one of the world's major polluting countries. Museveni said he regarded global warming as an act of aggression by developed countries against Africa. But Stern's stark message made clear how much African countries stand to suffer from global warming. Essayed says that afterwards it was easier to convince heads of state that Africa urgently needs stronger scientific capacity \u2014 not least to help the continent adapt to rising temperatures. \u201cI felt that we got more support for science after what happened during the climate-change debate,\u201d she says. The most ambitious commitment came from Paul Kagame, president of Rwanda. In his keynote speech, Kagame pledged to double his country's spending on research and development to 3% of its national income \u2014 the average for developed nations \u2014 within five years. The heads of state gave the go-ahead to the Green Wall for the Sahara, a ten-year plan to green the Sahara/Sahel region. And they agreed that work should begin on a 20-year biotechnology strategy. They hope to reconcile scientists, environmentalists, industry and church groups, who have been arguing over genetically modified crops, and find a common approach. The decision may disappoint Germany's scientific and technical aid agency GTZ, which is funding a separate Africa-wide project to develop some tough regulations on biotechnology. The three funding agencies to be set up are an education fund, an environment fund based on the successful United Nations Global Environment Facility, and a petroleum fund that will enable oil-rich countries to provide a financial cushion for poorer nations when oil prices are high. The reforms to intellectual property protection are centred on creating a pan-African organization to replace the two existing organizations that do this job \u2014 one for the 16 English-speaking countries, and one for the 16 French-speaking ones. The new body, vigorously lobbied for by the Geneva-based World Intellectual Property Organization, will also provide Africa-wide intellectual-property protection for north Africa's Arabic-speaking countries. The AU secretariat has until July to come up with a progress report. Initiatives that failed to get the nod include a council of presidents to monitor the implementation of the AU's scientific commitments. This was rejected on the advice of science ministers who felt that this was their job, for which they have recently set up the African Ministerial Council on Science and Technology. A second initiative that failed, for now, was an Africa-wide science and innovation fund. This fund may yet happen, according to Essayed. Heads of state asked for modifications, and the plan will be presented again at a future AU summit. \u201cI am going to nag them until we get this one through,\u201d she says. Beyond science and technology policy, the heads of state also moved ahead with plans for an African parliament, a central bank, a monetary fund and a court of human rights. These are in line with the AU's desire for complete political and economic integration, leading to what it calls a United States of Africa. \n                     Grounds for optimism \n                   \n                     Science in Africa: All eyes on Addis \n                   \n                     Science & Africa: A message to the G8 summit \n                   \n                     Africa 2005 \n                   \n                     GM crops: A continent divided \n                   \n                     Nature Newsblog African Union Budget \n                   \n                     African Union \n                   \n                     Commission for Africa \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

This article is part of Nature's Climate Change 2007 special. Last year's review on climate change by Nicholas Stern, a senior British civil servant and former vice-president of the World Bank, was conceived as the definitive statement on the cost of climate change. So far, though, its legacy has been a debate among economists that has as much to do with ethics as money. \u201cThe review and the critiques that have followed it highlight that many of the important questions boil down to what we choose to value,\u201d says Roger Pielke Jr, an expert in climate-change policy at the University of Colorado, Boulder. Perhaps the most vexing question is how current generations should value their successors' welfare. The Stern report, published in October 2006, concluded that doing nothing about climate change would mean a long-term loss in average world consumption of 5\u201320% per year, whereas stabilizing greenhouse-gas concentrations at roughly double pre-industrial levels would cost 1% of global gross domestic product (GDP) by the middle of this century, with a margin of error of plus or minus 3%. These calculations depend partly on the value we in the present assign to money received or spent in the future \u2014 determined by discounting. To stop climate change, we are being asked to pay now and live later, but most people value future benefits less than current costs, and will only invest if the projected pay-off is large enough. The contentious issue is the size of the 'pure-time' discount rate, which determines how much the the welfare of current generations is valued compared with future, as yet non-existent generations. The Stern review used a very low pure-time discount rate, treating current and future generations equally. But there is little consensus on this among economists. Some, such as William Nordhaus of Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut, find low rates hard to accept, adding that the way markets work supports this position. Stern's conclusion \u201cdepends decisively on the assumption of a near-zero discount rate\u201d, Nordhaus wrote in a critique posted on his website in November. Nordhaus recalculated Stern's assessment of the optimal rate at which emissions should be reduced using a pure-time discount rate of 3% that declines to 1% in 300 years, rather than the 0.1% rate used in the Stern review. The change cut the optimal rate of emissions reduction by 2050 from 25% to 14%. Stern retorts that a pure-time discount rate of 1% is \u201coutrageously high\u201d, as it values things happening in 100 years as only one-third as important as things happening now. Economist Partha Dasgupta of the University of Cambridge, UK, although largely supportive of Stern's conclusions, takes issue with the way that the report's egalitarian approach to different generations \u2014 valuing their well-being equally \u2014 is not carried through to its discussion of inequalities in today's world. Stern's calculations, Dasgupta argues, understate the degree to which a given dollar benefits a poor person more than a rich one. Such arguments may seem like a good way to stall progress, but many, including Stern, value the attention to ethics. \u201cHow important a problem climate change is and what society should do about it is all about subjective judgements,\u201d says Mike Hulme, director of the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research in Norwich, UK. However, the focus on the discount rate's effects on the estimated cost of damage has partly overshadowed the Stern report's second striking conclusion \u2014 that the worst effects of climate change can be avoided for at most 4% of GDP. A few weeks after the main report's publication, the Stern review team released a sensitivity analysis that looked at how the conclusions might differ with more conservative estimates of damage costs derived from different value systems. Further analyses will be published in the next couple of weeks. These have shown that the conclusion that prevention will be much cheaper than dealing with the damage is fairly robust, given moderate changes in the parameters. The debate about discount rates only looks at half the picture, says Ottmar Edenhofer, an economist at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany. Just as crucial is the debate about how to reduce emissions. \n                     How much will it cost to save the world? \n                   \n                     Putting the carbon back: The hundred billion tonne challenge \n                   \n                     Carbon credits for the Joneses \n                   \n                     Economists claim carbon cuts won't break the world's bank \n                   \n                     Nature News Special Regional Climate Change \n                   \n                     Climate Change in focus \n                   \n                     Stern Review on the economics of climate change \n                   \n                     William Nordhaus' critique on the Stern Review of climate change \n                   \n                     Partha Dasgupta's critique or the Stern Review of climate change \n                   \n                     Intergovernmental Panal on Climate Change \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Giuseppe Del Priore has the appearance and the soft-spoken, compassionate manner of a well-paid New York doctor. Just the type, in fact, that a woman might trust to stitch a new uterus into her barren abdomen. And that is exactly what Del Priore, an obstetrician and gynaecologist at New York Downtown Hospital, hopes to do, along with Jeanetta Stega and other colleagues. A spate of recent media reports has highlighted their plans to provide an infertile woman with a transplanted uterus so that she might bear a child \u2014 an operation that, if performed, would be only the second such attempt in the world. A transplant could potentially help some of the most intractable cases of infertility, such as women born without a uterus, those who underwent a hysterectomy at a young age because of cancer or fibroids, or those in whom an infection has closed up the organ. Many such women are desperate to have their own biological children, and the only way for them to do so at present is by having one of their embryos implanted in a surrogate mother \u2014 which is illegal in many countries. But some researchers and bioethicists are voicing concern about the prospect of uterus transplants. They argue that the risks are unknown and that the technique may be moving too fast into the clinic. \u201cIt's hard to think of another way [of bringing a child into a family] that would be more physically risky or expensive,\u201d says Thomas Murray, director of the Hastings Center, a bioethics research institute in Garrison, New York. If a member of his own family was considering it, he adds, \u201cI'd do everything in my power to talk her out of it.\u201d In a uterus transplant, the organ would be removed from a living or recently deceased donor and transferred to a recipient. Embryos previously created by  in vitro  fertilization would be transferred to the uterus and, after a child was born, the uterus would be removed to avoid a lifetime of taking powerful immunosuppressant drugs to prevent rejection. Del Priore says he realized that the operation was feasible after helping to pioneer a surgical technique for cervical cancer that preserves the uterus. In this process, he explains, the uterus is virtually removed from the body, as it would be during a transplant, but is then reconnected. Many women who have had such a procedure have gone on to have healthy babies. A human uterus transplant has already been done, in Saudi Arabia in 2000, but it had to be removed after 99 days because of a dangerous blood clot 1 . Most researchers, including Del Priore, say that before attempting the procedure in humans they want to gather more evidence that they can perform three crucial steps in animals: obtain a uterus, transplant it, and show that it can bear healthy offspring. \u201cYes, I think technically it can be done, but I say that with the greatest deal of caution, because it's a huge undertaking,\u201d Del Priore says. Another leading researcher in this small field, Mats Br\u00e4nnstr\u00f6m of Gothenburg University in Sweden, showed more than three years ago that mice could bear babies from a transplanted uterus. However, the donor and recipient were virtually genetically identical, so rejection was not an issue 2 . Since then, his team has successfully removed the uterus of a sheep, then replaced it in the same animal, he says. He believes she is now pregnant. But animal experiments such as these are not ideal models for a human transplant because the uteri have a different anatomy and, in the case of mice, rabbits and pigs, they support multiple fetuses whereas a woman's uterus typically holds only one or two. So Br\u00e4nnstr\u00f6m and others say they want to trial the operation in primates before starting in humans. Stefan Schlatt of the University of Pittsburgh in Pennsylvania, who is collaborating with the New York team, says he has tried and failed to perform the transplants in macaques. He adds that he has just received approval for a further two attempts. If primate experiments succeed, human ones are likely to follow quickly. \u201cOnce we show the first monkey baby, people will step up and say they want to do it,\u201d Schlatt says. \u201cPeople are so desperate to have children, they wouldn't wait for ten babies to be born to show it's safe.\u201d Researchers interviewed by  Nature  estimate that a human operation could take place within two to five years. Del Priore says he wants to accumulate animal data and gain more experience with human surgery before trying a human transplant: \u201cSomehow we hope we'll know when it's right.\u201d But there is no consensus on what experimental data are required before a human operation is considered an acceptable risk. The group is already laying the groundwork with donors and recipients. Earlier this year, they showed that it was possible to remove a healthy human uterus from a brain-dead organ donor whose heart was still beating 3 . The researchers are now compiling a list of interested recipients who are being sent information and consent forms to say they are willing to be evaluated for the procedure. The team says the evaluation process will include a psychological assessment and an explanation of alternatives such as adoption. Del Priore and his colleagues say they are motivated by the number of infertile women who are keen to undergo the operation and who understand the risks. But some bioethicists question how much of the work is really fuelled by doctors' ambition and ego \u2014 particularly in the fields of transplant surgery and reproductive medicine, both renowned for aggressively pursuing new methods. \u201cIt's a heady cocktail; it brings together two of the more adventurous branches of medicine,\u201d says Murray. Most transplants performed today \u2014 such as heart, lung and kidney transplants \u2014 are to cure life-threatening or critical conditions. There have been a few exceptions, such as the first face transplant last year, but these are controversial because it is difficult to judge whether the benefits of such transplants are outweighed by the risks. In the case of uterus transplants, the risk\u2013benefit calculation is even more complex as it must also factor in unknown threats to the future child. Although many thousands of children have been born worldwide to women who have received other transplants, some transplant recipients seem to be at increased risk of pregnancy complications such as high blood pressure and premature birth. It is also not known whether the immunosuppressant drugs might cause subtle effects that become apparent only when the children grow up 4 . Murray suggests that bodies such as the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists should investigate the procedure in order to guide future research. An international symposium on uterine transplantation is to be held in Gothenburg in April. \u201cI'm enthusiastic about the possibility of treatment,\u201d says Per-Olof Janson, a gynaecologist at Gothenburg University who is co-chairing the meeting, \u201cbut I'm hesitant about rushing.\u201d \n                     Ovarian transplant produces baby \n                   \n                     Surgeons struggle with ethical nightmare of face transplants \n                   \n                     Diabetes trial stirs debate on safety of xenotransplants \n                   \n                     Fertility Supplement \n                   \n                     Nature Outlook Fertility \n                   \n                     American Society of Transplant Surgeons \n                   \n                     The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Leading weapons experts and security think-tanks have accused the British government of withholding information needed for proper evaluation of a multibillion-pound proposal to renew the country's fleet of nuclear submarines. Crucial data on whether the life of the fleet can be extended have not been made public in the run-up to next month's expected parliamentary debate, say the critics. Not releasing the information, they add, fuels fears that the decision will be driven by party politics and industry lobbying rather than by security needs. Britain's four nuclear submarines, each of which carries up to 16 ballistic Trident missiles and 48 nuclear warheads, will reach the end of their design life in the early 2020s. In a report released last December, the government argued that it would not be prudent to extend the vessels' lives \u2014 and that work on replacements should start this year, at a probable cost of between \u00a315 billion and \u00a320 billion (US$30 billion to $40 billion). Some critics say that the decision is being rushed so that Prime Minister Tony Blair can secure the replacement of the submarines before he steps down this summer. But the decision to renew the fleet rests on broad engineering arguments, such as references to past submarine programmes, rather than on a detailed cost analysis. The Ministry of Defence says that releasing the specifics of its plan would amount to telling the world how its submarines work. Others say that this is an exaggeration and that withholding the information prevents a fair comparison with the main alternative: renovating the fleet to extend its life by 10 to 20 years. \u201cThere is absolutely not enough information out there to make a decision\u201d, says Richard Garwin, a physicist and senior adviser on nuclear weapons and other security questions to the US government. Garwin was one of several witnesses who gave evidence on proposed replacements for the submarines to the House of Commons Defence Committee on 23 January. But attempts to gather such information have been rebuffed. A London-based think-tank, the British American Security Information Council (BASIC), says that it has submitted around eight questions under freedom of information legislation to the Ministry of Defence. Answers to all technical questions, such as whether the submarine hull or the reactor would need to be renovated first, were declared classified. The environmental group Greenpeace has had similar requests and subsequent appeals turned down. \u201cThey are not going to let people discuss the technical details, even if the information is not particularly sensitive,\u201d says Paul Ingram, a senior analyst at BASIC. The ministry says that it answered many of the questions submitted, but that it has to balance public debate with the need to avoid helping nations that might want to undermine Britain's defences. A ministry spokesman said that no state currently had the capability and intent to do so, but that such a threat could potentially arise in coming decades. Attempts by Britain's top scientific organizations to join the debate have also been rejected. The Royal Society wrote to Roy Anderson, the Ministry of Defence's chief scientific adviser, last April and offered to suggest experts who could assist in the ministry's deliberations. The society was told a month later that the ministry had the matter covered. \u201cWe've been running the submarines safely for 40 years,\u201d explains Matthew Willey, a ministry spokesman. \u201cThere's a huge wealth of expertise here.\u201d But that attitude, says Garwin, contrasts starkly with that in the United States, where outside specialists are often granted the security clearance needed to assess scientific and engineering aspects of military decisions. Bodies such as the National Academy of Sciences are also commissioned by the federal government to report on security issues. Critics assert that the British approach skews decision making. John Finney, a physicist at University College London and a member of Pugwash, which campaigns to reduce armed conflict, says: \u201cWithout the technical information and costings of the different options, the agenda can be driven by industrial interests rather than those of national security.\u201d See Editorial,  \n                     page 459 \n                   . \n                     Nuclear weapons: The next nuke \n                   \n                     Bush buries US bunker-buster project \n                   \n                     Nuclear chiefs scotch story on frailty of ageing warheads \n                   \n                     Weapons proliferation: Asia's nuclear family \n                   \n                     Defence about defence \n                   \n                     BritishAmericanSecurityInformationCouncil http://www.basicint.org/  \n                   \n                     Federation of American Scientists \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Gravity feels like a force you can trust. Every day, unwavering, it keeps your feet planted firmly on the ground. But for many physicists, gravity is unsettling. It's the one force that doesn't fit into their quantum picture of the world. The best theory to describe it \u2014 Einstein's general theory of relativity \u2014 doesn't mesh with quantum mechanics. What's more, general relativity breaks down in the singularities thought to lurk at the centre of black holes, suggesting to physicists that the theory is incomplete. So last week at the University of Arizona in Tucson, around 50 physicists met at a workshop called 'rethinking gravity', to confront these problems. Over three days, participants debated what experiments they could use to hunt for flaws in the general theory of relativity, and asked whether dark matter or dark energy \u2014 the unknown stuff that cosmologists now reckon makes up 96% of the Universe \u2014 are clues to whatever deeper theory lies beneath. Their proposals stretch from a table-top experiment so delicate that it can be sent off-kilter by a single piece of dust, to ambitious space missions to measure the gravitational ripples created when two black holes coalesce into one. Theoretical progress in combining gravity and quantum mechanics has produced ideas such as string theory and loop quantum gravity. And although no theory has yet been proposed that physicists accept as compelling, efforts to develop alternatives have been bolstered by recent discoveries in cosmology. Maps of the temperature of the cosmic microwave background, for example \u2014 the radiation left over from the birth of the Universe \u2014 have revealed two opposing influences on the Universe's structure. One helps matter to clump together, the other accelerates the expansion of the Universe. Taken with other evidence, these observations suggest the existence of dark matter and dark energy, respectively. A modified theory of gravity might account for the effects \u2014 although not everyone is convinced that it will do so. \u201cIt's very easy to sit around in the coffee breaks and say, maybe there is no dark stuff and gravity is different,\u201d warns Sean Carroll of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, who works on alternative theories to produce expansion like that seen with dark energy. \u201cBut if you sit down to actually do something, there are rules you have to follow. It's harder than you might think.\u201d The hope now is that future experiments will detect some deviation from the predictions of general relativity, or some property of dark matter or dark energy, that will give theorists purchase on the problem. Daniel Holz of the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico says that, over the past decade, the balance of the field has shifted. \u201cIt's definitely experimentally driven at this point,\u201d he says. For instance, Eric Adelberger presented work from his group at the University of Washington in Seattle that checked for anomalies in how the strength of gravity changes with distance. In most circumstances, general relativity gives a dependence that is the same as that familiar from Newton's law: gravity varies with the inverse square of the separation. But new physics, such as the existence of extra dimensions, could modify this behaviour at short range, where these dimensions are thought to operate. Adelberger's group measured the gravitational attraction between two parallel discs as they were brought to 55 micrometres apart, finding no significant deviation from Newton's law (D. J. Kapner  et al .  Phys. Rev. Lett.   98,  021101; 2007). This set a new limit on the size of any extra dimension of 44 micrometres, some four times smaller than the previous best estimate. Other experiments will probe different facets of the theory. In particular, researchers are interested in tests of general relativity that involve strong gravitational fields, such as those around black holes. \u201cIt's a regime where we haven't tested gravity,\u201d explains Dimitrios Psaltis, one of the conference organizers. General relativity supposes that matter distorts the shape of space and time, similar to the way that a ball would sink into a rubber sheet. So far, experiments have mostly probed the gentle curvature around the Sun and planets. The shape of space and time around a black hole is expected to depend on just two of the black hole's properties: its mass and spin. The Tucson workshop heard that it might be possible to check that a black hole's spin is the same at all radii by tracking hot blobs of infalling matter, or by observing X-rays reflected from the object's surrounding disk of dust. However, Avery Broderick of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge, Massachusetts, who presented the results about infalling matter, cautions that processes in the vicinity of a black hole could affect the observations, making it a challenge to confirm whether any deviation is due to differences in gravity or the result of some overlooked astrophysics. Physicists also hope to test general relativity's predictions about unusual cosmological events, such as mergers of black holes, by detecting gravitational waves. So far, the existence of such waves has only been inferred by measuring changes in the orbit of a binary system containing a radio-emitting pulsar, and ground-based detectors have yet to pick any up. The probable launch date of a proposed space-based detector remains uncertain (see  'On the launch pad' ). But whether or not the next round of experiments helps to reconcile general relativity with quantum mechanics, the quest for such a glorious union will continue. \u201cWe know there's something we don't know, but we don't what it is,\u201d says Adelberger. \u201cWe just have to look as hard as we can.\u201d \n                     General relativity passes cosmic test \n                   \n                     Gravity probe falters \n                   \n                     NASA casts a shadow over bid to illuminate dark energy \n                   \n                     NASA roadmap charts route to a quarter-century of exploration \n                   \n                     University of Arizona: Rethinking gravity \n                   \n                     Wikipedia: Introduction to general relativity \n                   \n                     University of Washington: Short range tests of Newton's inverse square law \n                   \n                     NASA: Beyond Einstein \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

The California Institute for Regenerative Medicine (CIRM) is courting the top stem-cell official at the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) to take over as its president. James Battey, who since 2002 has coordinated stem-cell research at the NIH as chair of its Stem Cell Task Force, was approached by a member of the CIRM's governing committee in December after its current president, Zach Hall, announced his resignation (see  Nature 444, 803; 2006 ). Since then, Battey has been excused from all stem-cell-related work at the NIH, agency spokeswoman Marin Allen has confirmed. He remains in his position as director of the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders in Bethesda, Maryland. \u201cNIH is grateful for the leadership he has provided and is honouring his privacy,\u201d Allen wrote in an e-mail. Battey was considered as a candidate last time the CIRM was looking for a president, in early 2005 when the $3-billion institute was newly minted. It ended up hiring Hall. The 14-member search committee charged with finding the institute's next president was scheduled to hold its first meeting by teleconference on 31 January. Two days earlier, CIRM spokesman Dale Carlson called any discussion of Battey's candidacy premature. \u201cThe search committee hasn't met. They've not retained an [executive search] firm. They haven't posted a job description,\u201d he said. The search committee hasn't discussed a shortlist \u201cwith any real seriousness\u201d, member Joan Samuelson, founder of the Parkinson's Action Network, told  Nature  on 29 January. \u201cWe need to think about what talents and what skill set we need in the new president. And we should be clear about that before we write a job description,\u201d she said. The search committee's agenda for this week's meeting includes considering the president's job summary, application criteria and a 'potential timetable' for hiring. Battey is highly respected within the NIH as an able administrator who rarely makes trouble, but who will speak frankly when necessary. During the controversy over tightened conflict-of-interest rules at the agency, Battey said bluntly that if it adopted the stringent set of rules that was first proposed, he would resign (see  Nature   435 , 397; 2005). The rules were loosened before they were finalized. Battey's absence from his NIH stem-cell duties became publicly apparent at a 19 January Senate committee hearing on human embryonic stem-cell research. There, Story Landis, director of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, testified on behalf of the agency. She is now acting chair of the Stem Cell Task Force. It has also emerged that Battey will not be attending a meeting of stem-cell funding agencies being held in Singapore this week. The CIRM was created by California voters in a November 2004 ballot initiative as a state agency dedicated to making grants and loans for human embryonic stem-cell research and facilities. But its work has so far been held up by litigation challenging the ballot. With an end to that litigation now on the horizon, \u201cit's a crucial moment in our history\u201d, says Samuelson. \u201cThe choice of a president can have a lot to do with how much we move ahead and how fast.\u201d \n                     Congress and Bush set to clash on stem cells again \n                   \n                     News in brief \n                   \n                     The lure of stem-cell lines \n                   \n                     A long week in stem-cell politics... \n                   \n                     Stem Cells in focus \n                   \n                     Focus On Stem Cells \n                   \n                     Stem Cells Web focus \n                   \n                     National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders \n                   \n                     National Institutes of Health Stem Cell Task Force \n                   \n                     California Institute for Regenerative Medicine \n                   \n                     California Institute of Regenerative Medicine Press Release \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

But just before the report was released on 30 January, Bush officials declared that the president will request $143 million more for the oceans in his 2008 budget than in 2007. Of this, $80 million will be for research, with focuses on an ocean monitoring network, comparative analysis of marine ecosystems, and research on the water circulation in the Atlantic. The Bush administration's announcement also listed some legislative goals for the year. These included acceding to the United Nations Law of the Sea and passing specific authorizing legislation for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the main ocean-research agency, to increase its political heft. Carlos Gutierrez, head of the commerce department of which NOAA is part, says the plan will \u201csharpen our focus and expand our knowledge of our oceans, which is incredibly important for everything we do in the future\u201d. But most years, NOAA gets far more money from Congress than the president requests. So critics of Bush were quick to dismiss the announcement's significance. \u201cThe president's 2007 request provided $300 million less for ocean, coastal and Great Lakes programmes in research and resource management at NOAA than Congress gave the agency in 2006,\u201d says Bart Gordon (Democrat, Tennessee), chair of the House Committee on Science and Technology. \u201cWhile this year's budget request is an improvement, I suspect this is still disappointing news to those who want to see more attention paid to ocean and coastal issues.\u201d James Watkins, chair of the congressionally mandated Commission on Ocean Policy, which in 2004 recommended a far-reaching effort to bolster US ocean research, is also unconvinced. \u201cI have been around this town for 50 years and I have always been a bit leery of rhetoric versus reality when it comes to the budget,\u201d he says of Bush's plan for ocean research. \u201cWe need $750 million to get this kick-started \u2014 that's one day in Iraq.\u201d Gerald Leape, vice-president for marine conservation at the National Environmental Trust in Washington DC, says he is \u201csceptical\u201d about the Bush plan, but is generally hopeful about the budgetary outlook for ocean research this year. \n                     Scientists unite in bid to drive policy \n                   \n                     Bush slips off the hook over funds for ocean management \n                   \n                     Panel seeks fresh course for ocean research \n                   \n                     Ocean policy: Troubled waters \n                   \n                     Joint Ocean Commission Initiative \n                   \n                     Department of Commerce newsroom \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Indonesian geophysicists hope to stem the flow of a destructive mud volcano on East Java by dropping chains of concrete balls into its mouth. The mud eruption began on 29 May last year in the middle of a rice paddy in the village of Porong, 30 kilometres south of Surabaya, the provincial capital. Since then, the volcano has spewed out up to 126,000 cubic metres of mud a day, flooding an area of more than 4 square kilometres. Some 10,000 people have been left homeless and 20 factories have closed. Another 200,000 homes could be at risk if the mudflow combines with the rainy season \u2014 which has just begun \u2014 and weakening dams to flood more land. Attempts to alleviate the problem by drilling relief wells or channelling the mud into a nearby river have so far failed. Last week, the government team tackling the disaster approved a plan that will use 1,000 steel chains to try to slow the flow of mud. Each chain is 1.5 metres long and links together four concrete balls \u2014 two that are 40 centimetres across and two that are 20 centimetres across. Each ball and chain set will weigh about 300 kilograms. The balls themselves will be modified to maximize their friction with the mud. The team will start off slowly, dropping five chains into the volcano's mouth on the first day \u2014 possibly as early as this week \u2014 and ten on the second, before hitting a high of up to 50 per day until all of them are used. The scheme was dreamt up by three geophysicists at the Bandung Institute of Technology: Bagus Nurhandoko, Satria Bijaksana and Umar Fauzi. According to Basuki Hadimuljono, head of the national team managing the disaster, the project will have a budget of 4 billion rupiah (US$440,000) paid for by PT Lapindo Brantas, the oil drilling company that some locals blame for the disaster. Bijaksana says that the mudflow calls for an unprecedented solution. \u201cAt first we thought it was a common problem in oil exploration, but after a few months we realized this was not a standard situation,\u201d he notes. On 22 January, in a smoky room at the disaster management team's Surabaya headquarters, the geophysicists met with scientists and engineers from the government and the oil company to work out the details of the plan. The next day, Bijaksana and Fauzi were crawling up the side of the volcano to map out plans for the foundations of a bridge that will span the crater and, with the help of a pulley system, will be used for dropping in the chains. The chains will sink into the conduit that has been feeding the hot mud to the surface, Fauzi explains. \u201cWe are aiming to get them to go 100 metres down, but the deeper the better,\u201d he says. The goal is to make the channel smaller \u2014 not plugging it altogether but, according to a model built by the team, narrowing it enough to slow the mud's rise and so decrease its flow rate by up to three-quarters. Forced to go around the chains and balls, the mud will give up some of its energy to friction, vibration and rotation, says Nurhandoko. \u201cIt will make the mud tired. We're killing the mud softly.\u201d But other physicists say they have never heard of such an approach, and question its likely effectiveness. Richard Swarbrick, managing director of consultancy firm GeoPressure Technology in Durham, UK, says that cutting the size of the channel could very well reduce the mud flow. And forcing the mud to take a 'tortuous' path around the balls would also slow it down, he says. But he points out that reducing the size of the channel is likely to increase the pressure, just like squeezing the end of a hose. \u201cI would predict that the mud would probably exit at the other holes, or farther along,\u201d says Swarbrick. This would just transfer the problem to somewhere else. \u201cThe mud will find another way out,\u201d he says. Confident in the face of such criticism, Bijaksana and his colleagues admit that their plan might sound improbable at first. \u201cIt took a few months to settle down and make peace with ourselves,\u201d he says. But the trio used a simple analogy to sell the project to the government. They cut two holes in the bottom of a plastic bottle and filled it with water. Covering one hole, they showed that the flow rate from the other is unaffected \u2014 but the overall rate at which the water leaves the bottle decreases. Likewise, with the volcano, they believe that the volume coming out is directly proportional to the size of the neck of the conduit bringing the mud to the surface. Bijaksana says there are still uncertainties \u2014 the exact flow rate of the mud, for example, and the shape of the crater \u2014 that could affect the project's success. He hopes that instruments now being laid over the crater will provide some more information, and adds that he isn't worried about the uncertainty. \u201cPeople all around here are living in uncertainty,\u201d he points out. \n                     Mud volcano floods Java \n                   \n                     Java mud volcano seems unstoppable \n                   \n                     Bandung Institute of Technology \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

The author of  Nail 'Em! Confronting High-Profile Attacks on Celebrities and Businesses  is not the kind of figure normally associated with the relatively sedate world of scientific publishing. Besides writing the odd novel, Eric Dezenhall has made a name for himself helping companies and celebrities protect their reputations, working for example with Jeffrey Skilling, the former Enron chief now serving a 24-year jail term for fraud. Although Dezenhall declines to comment on Skilling and his other clients, his firm, Dezenhall Resources, was also reported by  Business Week  to have used money from oil giant ExxonMobil to criticize the environmental group Greenpeace. \u201cHe's the pit bull of public relations,\u201d says Kevin McCauley, an editor at the magazine  O'Dwyer's PR Report . Now,  Nature  has learned, a group of big scientific publishers has hired the pit bull to take on the free-information movement, which campaigns for scientific results to be made freely available. Some traditional journals, which depend on subscription charges, say that open-access journals and public databases of scientific papers such as the National Institutes of Health's (NIH's) PubMed Central, threaten their livelihoods. From e-mails passed to  Nature , it seems Dezenhall spoke to employees from Elsevier, Wiley and the American Chemical Society at a meeting arranged last July by the Association of American Publishers (AAP). A follow-up message in which Dezenhall suggests a strategy for the publishers provides some insight into the approach they are considering taking. The consultant advised them to focus on simple messages, such as \u201cPublic access equals government censorship\u201d. He hinted that the publishers should attempt to equate traditional publishing models with peer review, and \u201cpaint a picture of what the world would look like without peer-reviewed articles\u201d. Dezenhall also recommended joining forces with groups that may be ideologically opposed to government-mandated projects such as PubMed Central, including organizations that have angered scientists. One suggestion was the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a conservative think-tank based in Washington DC, which has used oil-industry money to promote sceptical views on climate change. Dezenhall estimated his fee for the campaign at $300,000\u2013500,000. In an enthusiastic e-mail sent to colleagues after the meeting, Susan Spilka, Wiley's director of corporate communications, said Dezenhall explained that publishers had acted too defensively on the free-information issue and worried too much about making precise statements. Dezenhall noted that if the other side is on the defensive, it doesn't matter if they can discredit your statements, she added: \u201cMedia messaging is not the same as intellectual debate. Officials at the AAP would not comment to  Nature  on the details of their work with Dezenhall, or the money involved, but acknowledged that they had met him and subsequently contracted his firm to work on the issue. \u201cWe're like any firm under siege,\u201d says Barbara Meredith, a vice-president at the organization. \u201cIt's common to hire a PR firm when you're under siege.\u201d She says the AAP needs to counter messages from groups such as the Public Library of Science (PLoS), an open-access publisher and prominent advocate of free access to information. PLoS's publicity budget stretches to television advertisements produced by North Woods Advertising of Minneapolis, a firm best known for its role in the unexpected election of former professional wrestler Jesse Ventura to the governorship of Minnesota. The publishers' link with Dezenhall reflects how seriously they are taking recent developments on access to information. Minutes of a 2006 AAP meeting sent to  Nature  show that particular attention is being paid to PubMed Central. Since 2005, the NIH has asked all researchers that it funds to send copies of accepted papers to the archive, but only a small percentage actually do. Congress is expected to consider a bill later this year that would make submission compulsory. Brian Crawford, a senior vice-president at the American Chemical Society and a member of the AAP executive chair, says that Dezenhall's suggestions have been refined and that the publishers have not to his knowledge sought to work with the Competitive Enterprise Institute. On the censorship message, he adds: \u201cWhen any government or funding agency houses and disseminates for public consumption only the work it itself funds, that constitutes a form of selection and self-promotion of that entity's interests.\u201d Editor's note:  In the original version of this story, Susan Spilka was reported as emailing a note that said \"Media massaging is not the same as intellectual debate.\" It should have read \"Media messaging\", and has been changed accordingly. \n                     Congress pushes plan to make papers free \n                   \n                     Open-access journal hits rocky times \n                   \n                     UK research councils claim success for open-access publishing plan \n                   \n                     NIH open-access plans draw fire from both sides \n                   \n                     Access to the literature web focus \n                   \n                     Association of American Publishers \n                   \n                     PubMed Central \n                   \n                     Dezenhall Resources \n                   \n                     Business Week article on Eric Dezenhall \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Can visible light ever be manipulated so that it bends the wrong way? If it could, a range of futuristic devices would be tantalizingly close to reality, such as a lens for imaging features smaller than the wavelength of light, or a shield to render objects invisible. Several scientists have written off such 'negative refraction' in the visible range as practically impossible but a group is now claiming to have achieved it, spurring a debate about what constitutes true refraction. Light bends in a specific way when it passes from one medium to another \u2014 an effect called refraction. Negative refraction describes a situation in which light bends the opposite way. It happens only if the direction in which the peaks and troughs travel along a light wave can be reversed relative to the direction in which the wave itself is travelling. A material with a negative refractive index would focus light perfectly instead of dispersing it. This led John Pendry of Imperial College London to predict that a 'perfect' lens could be made, which would image features smaller than the wavelength of light. Some asserted that refraction could only ever have a positive value. But the debate was settled in 2003 when negative refraction was demonstrated for microwaves 1 , 2  and later for infrared waves. Researchers achieved the effect with 'metamaterials' that had components of roughly the same size as the light's wavelength. More recently, Pendry used a metamaterial to bend light around an object to create an 'invisibility shield', also for microwaves 3 . But achieving similar effects for visible light has seemed well out of reach. Radiation in the microwave and infrared ranges has wavelengths in the order of micrometres or centimetres, so the components of the material used to negatively refract them are also on this scale. But building something equivalent for visible light, with a wavelength of some 500 nanometres, is a huge challenge. Now Jennifer Dionne and Henri Lezec, working in Harry Atwater's group at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, have unveiled a material that they say has a negative refractive index for visible light. Dionne presented the results on 11 January at Nanometa 2007, a conference on nanophotonics and metamaterials held in Seefeld, Austria, and the group has submitted them for publication. Rather than try to create a material with components as small as the wavelength of visible light, theoreticians recently suggested taking advantage of electromagnetic waves called surface plasmons, created when light hits free electrons oscillating on the surface of a metal, to guide the light in the desired direction. This is what Dionne and Lezec have now done. Their device, called a waveguide, consists of the insulator silicon nitride sandwiched between two sheets of silver. Light enters the device through a slit in the upper silver sheet. Once inside, the light wave couples with oscillating electrons in the silver to create a surface plasmon wave that travels along the metal's surface. But embedded in the silicon nitride is a gold-coated prism, with a gap between it and the upper silver sheet that is just 50 nanometres wide (see  graphic ). As the surface plasmon wave crosses this gap, it is refracted. Dionne says that she has detected light with wavelengths of 480\u2013530 nm (blue-green) emerging from the device having undergone negative refraction. The refractive index reached as low as \u22125 (compared with +1.33, for light travelling from air into water). Passing the surface plasmons through the thin gap above the prism confines their movement, so only one mode of surface plasmon wave can get through. At certain wavelengths of light, the frequency of the surface plasmon wave is close to the frequency of the oscillating electrons within the bulk of the metal. In this case the surface plasmon wave and the oscillating electrons interact in such a way that the direction of travel of the wave's peaks and troughs is reversed, giving negative refraction. For Dionne, the goal of \u201cpeeking round the corner\u201d has been achieved. \u201cIt's like alchemy,\u201d she says. \u201cBut it works.\u201d Others in the field are more cautious. Mark Stockman, a theoretician at Georgia State University in Atlanta, is concerned about the system's inefficiency, pointing out that only about 1% of the light gets through. Dionne emphasizes that enough light gets through to be detected directly and says she thinks improvements can be made. And some are unconvinced that it offers true negative refraction. Allan Boardman, a theoretician from the University of Salford, UK, and Vladimir Shalaev from Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana, who are also trying to negatively refract visible light, argue that the experiment simply shows negative refraction of plasmons, rather than of light itself. \u201cIt's not negative refraction per se,\u201d says Boardman. \u201cThey've got to qualify it a lot more.\u201d But others such as Nikolay Zheludev of the University of Southampton, UK, say this doesn't really matter, because the end result is the same. \u201cIf everything is correct, this is a grand claim,\u201d says Zheludev. \u201cYes, they had negative refraction,\u201d agrees metamaterials and plasmonics expert Eli Yablonovitch from the University of California, Los Angeles. \u201cI don't see much controversy there.\u201d Pendry is also convinced, although he says he didn't expect to see the effect demonstrated so soon. \u201cIt is very impressive,\u201d he says. \u201cThey've done it in a most spectacular way.\u201d Whether the approach counts as true negative refraction or not, to do anything useful with it will require turning the two-dimensional system into a three-dimensional device. Atwater envisages stacking a dense array of waveguides on end: \u201cWe have not done this yet, but at least this work illustrates the inherent possibility of doing so.\u201d \n                     Invisibility cloaks are in sight \n                   \n                     Engineers devise invisibility shield \n                   \n                     Metamaterial bends microwaves into beam \n                   \n                     Negative refraction: A lens less ordinary \n                   \n                     Nature Photonics \n                   \n                     Metamaterials web group \n                   \n                     Nanometa 2007 \n                   \n                     Metamorphose network of excellence \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Washington DC There is no scientific basis for current interrogation techniques, a US government-funded study has found. The report has stirred up controversy by calling for more research into the matter, angering many psychiatrists who believe such work is unethical. The 374-page study on \u201ceducing information\u201d was conducted by the Intelligence Science Board, an independent panel that advises the government's intelligence agencies. The report concludes that \u201cvirtually none of the interrogation techniques used by US personnel over the past half-century have been subjected to scientific or systematic enquiry or evaluation\u201d. First published in December, the report became public last week after it was leaked to the Federation of American Scientists, a watchdog group based in Washington DC. Members of the study group declined to comment, citing the sensitive nature of their work. The report provides a comprehensive review of military and law-enforcement interrogation techniques and finds numerous misperceptions, both within and outside professional circles. For example, it concludes that the belief that torture breaks down a subject's resistance is without technical merit, as is the effectiveness of strategies such as sleep deprivation. It also finds that professional interrogators have as many erroneous beliefs as novices about how to use body language to spot liars, and concludes that current lie-detection technology is still highly unreliable. In a controversial final chapter, the report calls for a systematic investigation of interrogation techniques to determine which yield the best information, and suggests reviewing the testimonials of former US prisoners of war to understand whether and how torture worked on them. Finally, it calls for controlled studies on soldiers undergoing survival training and on college students willing to participate in \u201cbenign\u201d research. Such studies might be useful if they are conducted safely and ethically, says Steven Aftergood of the Federation of American Scientists. He points out that regardless of scientists' position on the matter, US soldiers and intelligence officers seem to be engaging in harsh interrogation practices in Iraq, Afghanistan and at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba, so they need to know what works, and what doesn't. \u201cWe have not done very well in the absence of research,\u201d he says. Others disagree. \u201cI doubt very much that any research could be done in a university setting or that any ethical person would do it,\u201d says Alan Stone, a psychiatrist at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Stone points out that interrogation is often designed to induce stress, and that raises a host of \u201cintractable\u201d ethical issues, such as how to gain consent from study subjects. The fields of psychology and psychiatry are split over whether to carry out such work.

Last August, the entire editorial board of the Elsevier journal  Topology  quit in a row over pricing. Now they are setting up a non-profit competitor to be published by the London Mathematical Society. The  Journal of Topology , announced last week, will launch next January and will cost US$570 per year, compared with  Topology 's $1,665. It's not the first such move. Over the past eight years, around a dozen cheap or open-access journals have been created to compete directly with an expensive commercial journal, many by editorial boards that had quit the original publication in protest. So, do the cheaper journals fare better than their rivals? As far as scientific credibility is concerned, the answer is often yes \u2014 many of the challengers have obtained impact factors (a measure of the citations its papers receive) higher than their competitor. For example, the  Journal of Machine Learning Research , set up in 2001 by editors of Springer's  Machine Learning , has a 2005 impact factor of 4.027. \u201cThat's the highest in artificial intelligence, automation and control, and ninth in all of computer science,\u201d says Leslie Pack Kaelbling, a researcher at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge and the journal's editor-in-chief.  Machine Learning  has a 2005 impact factor of just 3.1. One of the first defections was  Evolutionary Ecology Research , set up in 1999 by Michael Rosenzweig, a researcher at the University of Arizona in Tucson. He defected, along with the entire editorial board, from  Evolutionary Ecology , then published by Wolters Kluwer. Rosenzweig had established the journal in 1987, but became disillusioned with price increases. The new journal has survived, with the online version getting up to 80,000 page views a month and a 50% increase in its number of pages, says Rosenzweig. He says the journal pioneered the idea of allowing libraries to subscribe only to an electronic version. Although its impact factor of 1.61 lags behind  Evolutionary Ecology 's 1.77, he dismisses this as unimportant: \u201cImpact factors are toxic for science and the journals that serve it.\u201d Like many of the rebel journals,  Evolutionary Ecology Research  was set up with help from the Scholarly Publishing and Academic Resources Coalition (SPARC), which fosters greater access to the literature. Joan Birman of Columbia University in New York is on the editorial board of  Geometry and Topology , another SPARC-supported journal. She says it \u201chas done better than we could have dreamed\u201d. But despite scholarly success, the journals often get poor support from libraries. \u201cLibraries have not given us anything like the support, via subscriptions, that mathematicians have given us via submissions,\u201d says Birman. \u201cSubscriptions have been an uphill battle.

Bangalore Encompassing most of central and western India, the Deccan Traps is the world's largest continental flood-basalt province outside Siberia. In the 1970s, it was a candidate for storing nuclear waste, but fears of ground-water contamination killed that idea. Now it is being proposed as a site for locking away another global nuisance, carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) \u2014 perhaps enough to make a significant dent in global warming. The Deccan Traps is a thick pile of solidified lava from volcanic eruptions 65 million years ago. Indian and American geologists have launched a joint study to see how well they can trap the CO 2  that has been captured from coal-fired power stations within and below the basalt layers. Inspiration for the project came from research at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) in Richland, Washington, which found that water saturated with CO 2  reacts rapidly with basalt to form stable carbonate minerals (see  Nature 444, 792\u2013793; 2006 ). Many countries have considered capturing CO 2  from power stations and storing it in aquifers or used oil wells, but there is always a risk that the dissolved gas could escape. If the gas could be converted into solid minerals within rock, however, it could be locked away long-term. Pete McGrail of the PNNL reported the findings to a conference on CO 2  capture and storage held in Hyderabad in India on 12\u201313 January. The US Pacific Northwest has similar basalt deposits, which McGrail's group now estimates could hold more than 50 gigatonnes of CO 2 . \u201cWe are lucky to have the Deccan Traps, which is much bigger,\u201d says Ramakrishna Sonde, executive director of the National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) in New Delhi, which builds and runs India's coal-fired power stations. The NTPC is collaborating with the PNNL and the National Geophysical Research Institute (NGRI) in Hyderabad on the pilot study. Sonde says that he tentatively estimates that the Deccan Traps might be able to hold 150 gigatonnes of CO 2  \u2014 as much as the world's power industry might emit in 15 years. The three-way project, to which India has committed US$1.3 million, is one of the 17 initiatives endorsed by the Carbon Sequestration Leadership Forum, a voluntary climate initiative of which India was a founding member. \u201cWe look at coal as a dominant energy source, so CO 2  sequestration is something we cannot ignore,\u201d Malti Goel, a senior official in the Indian science ministry and co-chair of the Hyderabad conference, told  Nature . NGRI scientists admit that basalt isn't very porous, making it hard to disperse CO 2  through the rock, but say that this is compensated by its high reactivity with the gas. The ultimate idea is to pump supercritical CO 2  into porous sedimentary rocks below the basalt layer. The gas would move upwards though the rock and react with the basalt above, forming a 'cap' that would stop any unreacted gas from escaping. Some geologists, however, seem to be sceptical about the whole project. \u201cI will not recommend CO 2  sequestration in volcanic areas,\u201d says Kiran Shankar Misra, deputy director general of the Geological Survey of India. \u201cThese are regions that are hot, and the basalts are highly fractured.\u201d He says that he is worried that the heat in the rock would cause the dissolved CO 2  to become gaseous, and that it could then seep out through the fractures. \u201cThe CO 2  will not stay there.\u201d Hetu Sheth, a geologist at the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay, points out that unlike the Columbia River basalts, which are only 14 million to 17 million years old, the Deccan lavas are highly weathered, meaning that they will already have reacted with CO 2  in the air to a certain extent. \u201cTheir capacity for reacting with newly injected CO 2  may therefore be low, certainly lower than the Columbia River basalts,\u201d says Sheth. Before any CO 2  is injected into the Deccan basalts, an initial phase of the project, scheduled to take 18 months, will characterize the permeability and porosity of the rock. It will also look at the nature of faults within the rock, to determine how CO 2  would flow through the rock once injected. The PNNL is due to start pumping CO 2  into the Columbia River basin basalts later this year, a project that Sonde says India is \u201ckeenly watching\u201d. Reprints and Permissions"},

But energy experts say that it's not that easy. Michael Hopkin reports. On 26 January, the British parliament will vote on whether to turn its back on a cherished piece of the country's heritage: Greenwich Mean Time, long the standard against which the world's clocks were set. Under the proposal, Britons would set their watches forward an hour year-round, putting them on the same time as the rest of Europe, and never on Greenwich time. If adopted, the measure would give Britain an extra hour of daylight in the evening. Backers argue that the proposal could cut automobile accidents, saving more than 100 lives per year, and slash demands on the country's power grid, saving carbon emissions equivalent to those generated by 70,000 people in a year. British clocks would still go forward an hour every spring and back again in autumn, just as they have almost every year since 1916, when the country adopted British Summer Time. Under the new scheme, which would be trialled for a period of three years, clocks would be set an hour ahead of Greenwich in the winter, and two hours ahead in summer \u2014 a regime called 'single-double summer time'. But history shows that such seemingly simple changes are not made easily. A similar experiment in the late 1960s failed, mainly because of parents' complaints about children going to school in the dark and the grumblings of farmers and other outdoor workers. Energy experts say that it's not so easy to calculate the true benefits for the environment. The move comes as US citizens prepare for a longer summer, by pushing their clocks forward on 11 March \u2014 three weeks earlier than usual. US politicians have claimed that the country will save 100,000 barrels of oil per day, but will wait until the scheme is underway to gather detailed data on changes in energy use. Both the British and US policies are extensions of the current scope of daylight-saving time (DST), which is practised in roughly 70 countries, almost all of which are at temperate latitudes. DST artificially shifts the time of dawn and dusk forward by an hour during the long summer days, providing an extra hour of light in the evenings. As the winter days draw near, the clocks are put back again so that mornings don't become unbearably dark. But the DST scheme can be taken further, argues Elizabeth Garnsey, an innovation researcher at the University of Cambridge, UK, who has evaluated the probable effects of the proposed changes to the British system. \u201cCountries are starting to realize that their daylight-saving policies haven't really been saving daylight,\u201d she says. Moving the clocks forward yet another hour would produce a slew of benefits, she says. The reduced need for lighting in the afternoons could save around \u00a3485 million (US$957 million) a year, as well as 170,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide. Preliminary calculations cited by the proposal's backers suggest that domestic lighting bills could dip by 0.8%, whereas commercial spending could be cut by 4% as more working days finish during daylight. And because the late afternoon is also the time of peak power demand, analysts at National Grid, which coordinates Britain's power supply, predict that fewer power plants will be needed at any one time, so less efficient ones will be needed less often. The problem is, however, that the science behind the numbers remains sketchy at best. For her calculations, Garnsey and her colleagues compared the energy consumption only in the weeks directly on either side of a clock change, as the gradual shifting of the day length over the year makes it very difficult to compare annual energy use on regular time versus DST. And so it remains hard to say what the overall year-round effect would be. \u201cI don't think that any really exhaustive work has been done anywhere,\u201d Garnsey admits. \u201cIn terms of carbon emissions, I wouldn't say we really know yet. But in spring and autumn, there is quite substantial waste of electricity.\u201d Another main argument for pushing the clocks forward has been the estimated lives saved from automobile accidents. Lord Sainsbury, the former British science minister, has claimed that the earlier experiment, when the country remained an hour ahead of Greenwich time year-round between1968 and 1971, saved an average of 140 lives a year. That adds up to nearly 5,000 needless deaths over the past quarter-century as a result of adhering to Greenwich time in winter, says Garnsey. \u201cThat should be the deciding factor,\u201d she says. Others point to the increased opportunity for the old and the young to pursue outdoor activities in the evening, and benefits to businesses of aligning themselves with continental Europe. \u201cThe quality of life of nearly everyone will be improved,\u201d says Tim Yeo, the member of parliament who is sponsoring the UK bill. Previous experiments with daylight-saving changes have not exactly borne that out. In Australia in 2000, officials experimented with an early start to DST to save energy. But energy consumption in Sydney, the host city for the Olympic Games that year, did not really fall and the change was not made permanent. And two of the largest developing countries in terms of energy \u2014 India and China \u2014 do not observe DST, even though they cover huge areas; China, in particular, spans four time zones yet has the same time across the country and all year round. In the United States, Congress approved the shift in their DST last year. The clocks will be put forward in March rather than April, then back in November rather than October. The change gains Americans four extra weeks of DST, the first change in the system since 1966. Most of Canada will observe the same change. Meanwhile, the outcome of the British legislation hangs in the balance. Yeo, the measure's most prominent supporter, is a member of the opposition Conservative party, and the Labour government has refused to back the idea. The issue is more about politics for popularity than sound policy, argues energy expert Mayer Hillman, emeritus fellow at the Policy Studies Institute in London. He has been calling for Britain to adopt single-double summer time since 1988. Although lighter evenings led to a drop in the number of road accidents, he notes that a popular myth persists that putting the clock forward is more dangerous, because a small spike was seen in the number of early-morning accidents after DST was introduced. \u201cI can't tell you how maddening it is,\u201d he says. And some might doubt that the precise hours of daylight really make a difference to people's behaviour anyway. A new survey of more than 21,000 Germans (T. Roenneberg, C. J. Kumar & M. Merrow  Curr. Biol.   17 , R44\u2013R45; 2007) suggests that, in rural areas at least, people naturally fall into synch with the different daylight hours as they vary with geographical location, rising and going to bed with the Sun irrespective of the time shown on their watch. If the US and British proposals prove successful, then analysts can finally come closer to answering questions about the true importance of setting the clocks correctly. \u201cIt may be that in the middle of winter there's not really much benefit,\u201d says Garnsey. \u201cBut the reason the experiment is needed is to get the correct data.

Take one prestigious laboratory. Add some pressing grant deadlines and a dash of apprehension about whether the applications will succeed. Throw in an overworked lab head, a gang of competitive postdocs and some shoddy record-keeping. Finally, insert a cynical scientist with a feeling that he or she is owed glory. It sounds hellish, but elements of this workplace will be familiar to many researchers. And that's worrying, as such an environment is, according to sociologists, the most fertile breeding ground for research misconduct. Just a decade ago, such a statement would have been speculation. But sociologists are increasingly confident that they understand why scientists cheat. Studies of disgraced researchers, a series of high-profile misconduct cases, and a stream of government funding have created the discipline of research into research integrity. The results are a better understanding of those who betray science, and of the climate in which they do so. They also suggest how misconduct can be reduced, although there are good reasons to think it will never be eliminated. To tease apart the factors behind acts such as fabricating data or unfairly appropriating ideas, sociologists say we must turn away from the media glare that surrounds extreme cases such as Woo Suk Hwang, the South Korean stem-cell scientist who faked high-profile papers on human cloning 1 . Such cases are to research integrity what serial killers are to crime prevention, says Kenneth Pimple, an ethicist at Indiana University in Bloomington. Hwang and others grab the headlines, but minor acts of misconduct are much more common, and potentially more damaging to scientific progress. That runs against the grain of traditional thinking on misconduct, at least among scientific societies, which have often argued that cheating is due mainly to a few bad apples. But that view now looks much less tenable. When scientists funded by the US National Institutes of Health were asked in 2002 about misconduct, a third said they had committed at least one of ten serious errant acts, such as falsifying data or ignoring important aspects of the regulations regarding human subjects 2 . Young physicists also returned disturbing results when questioned by the American Physical Society in 2003: more than 10% had observed others giving less than truthful descriptions of research techniques or analyses, for example. To understand what is driving these figures, researchers would like to study confirmed cases of misconduct. Information here is sparse, as convicted scientists do not generally rush to tell their stories. What data there are lie mainly in the files of the US Office of Research Integrity (ORI), which oversees biomedical misconduct investigations in the United States. Mark Davis, a criminologist at Kent State University in Ohio, trawled 92 ORI cases from 2000 and earlier and revealed seven factors frequently associated with misconduct 3 . Some involve research climate, such as a lack of support from superiors or competition for promotion. Others, such as a tendency to blame the difficulty of a particular experimental task, point to ways in which individuals justify their own actions. \n               Habit-forming \n             To get a finer-grained image of these factors, sociologists turn to survey data. At the University of Oklahoma in Norman, for example, researchers asked doctoral students how they would react to specific ethical dilemmas, such as if a researcher takes an idea from a colleague and, without letting that colleague know, uses it to apply for funding. Many of the factors seen in Davis's survey cropped up again, but by asking students about their past and present experiences the Oklahoma team, which presented its work at the ORI conference in Tampa, Florida, last year, added new details. In particular, its work suggests that past experience, such as graduate training, can be more important than the current climate in which people work. Day-to-day aspects matter \u2014 interpersonal conflict was associated with unethical decisions, for example \u2014 but former experiences, such as having worked in a lab where the head showed positive leadership, seem to be more important. The need for support extends beyond the level of research groups. Brian Martinson from the HealthPartners Research Foundation in Minneapolis and his colleagues have studied misconduct using the theory of organizational justice, which states that employees are more likely to behave unethically if they believe their managers are treating them unfairly. Sure enough, Martinson's survey respondents were more likely to admit misconduct if they felt that governing structures, such as funding review bodies, had treated them badly 4 . In an as-yet unpublished role-playing exercise, Patricia Keith-Spiegel of Simmons College in Boston, Massachusetts, also found that researchers were more likely to act unethically if a negative decision by a review board was not properly explained. With these results in place, misconduct experts can make tentative statements about how to limit problems. Robust and positive mentoring is top of the list. At the ORI, for example, director Chris Pascal says that a hands-on principal investigator (PI) who talks to junior scientists regularly and stresses the need to run experiments properly, rather than rushing out results, can make a big difference: \u201cGet a PI like that and the risk of misconduct is much lower.\u201d Institutional polices that insist on good record-keeping are also essential, adds Pascal. Both pieces of advice seem straightforward, but neither are followed as much as they should be. A 2003 ORI survey 5  concluded, for example, that one in four lab heads did not take their supervisory roles seriously enough. Many institutions also fail to enforce data-management policies, says Pascal. That is worrying, as poor record-keeping was present in almost 40% of more than 550 misconduct cases studied in a survey published this month 6 . Would these actions address all the causes of misconduct? Almost all scientists have felt pressure at some point in their careers, yet the surveys suggest that the majority do not commit even minor misdeeds. \u201cIt doesn't push everyone over the edge,\u201d says Nicholas Steneck, a historian at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor who has worked on misconduct policies for the ORI and other organizations. \u201cIt comes down to individuals.\u201d Here the research is more controversial. Alongside environmental factors, the Oklahoma group has looked for links between personality traits and ethical decisions. For each of the four areas looked at, from data management to experimental practice, the team found that subjects with high ratings for narcissism returned low scores. A sense of entitlement \u2014 'I'm owed this result because of my hard work' \u2014 also predisposes researchers to misconduct. But so does having a trusting view of others. Such results might improve understanding, but the potential for abuse worries some. Martinson says the situation reminds him of the science-fiction movie  Minority Report , in which premonitions are used to apprehend individuals thought to be future criminals. Universities might, for example, choose to reduce misconduct risk by screening for traits such as narcissism in potential employees. \u201cWhat you can do with this is frightening,\u201d says Martinson. \u201cIt doesn't lead to positive social control. At the extreme it leads to a police state.\u201d That need not be case, argues Stephen Murphy, a PhD student who has worked on several of the Oklahoma studies. Rather than weed out individuals, personality work can inform research-integrity courses. Asked about ethical decisions, for example, most researchers declare themselves more ethical than their colleagues. Illustrating this by giving scientists a questionnaire and then sharing the results with a group is a powerful way of showing researchers that they are more flawed than they think, says Murphy. Those with narcissistic tendencies would not be treated any differently, but they might benefit more from such an exercise. \n               Over the edge \n             Yet even when knowledge of individual and environmental factors has been plugged into integrity training, there remains a bigger question about the way science is run. Many scientists work under enormous pressure, even in an era of relatively generous funding. Career paths in science exacerbate the situation. Unlike many other professions, scientists must constantly prove themselves by publishing papers. Success also depends not just on the view of a few immediate colleagues, but on that of the whole field. \u201cIt's about building a reputation,\u201d says Martinson. \u201cIn science that's the coin of the realm.\u201d The case of obesity expert Eric Poehlman shows how these factors can push people over the edge. During his trial last year, when he was sentenced to a year in jail after admitting falsifying data in papers and grant applications, he said: \u201cThe structure...created pressures which I should have, but was not able to, stand up to. I saw my job and my laboratory as expendable if I were not able to produce.\u201d The similarities between Poehlman's testimony and that of many other fraudsters point to factors that institutions can tackle. The problem is that many of the risk factors for misconduct also seem to be what makes for good science. Most would agree that competition is needed to allocate over-subscribed research funds appropriately, as well as to push individuals to evaluate their ideas. So even with the best research environment and training, fraud is unlikely to disappear. \u201cIt's the dark side of competition,\u201d says Martinson. While the pressure remains, so will some level of misconduct. \n                     Leading by example \n                   \n                     Misconduct?

The 1918 influenza virus, which killed some 50 million people worldwide, has proved fatal to macaques infected in a laboratory. The study follows  Nature 's controversial publication 1  of the virus's sequence in 2005, alongside a paper in  Science  that described the recreation of the virus from a corpse and its potency in mice 2 . Some scientists question the wisdom of reconstructing such a deadly virus. Do the benefits outweigh the risks? Those who carried out the macaque study say yes, as a better understanding of how it acts in a system similar to humans' will help scientists treat future pandemics. The study was carried out in the biohazard level 4 labs of the Public Health Agency of Canada in Winnipeg. Yoshihiro Kawaoka of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and his colleagues infected macaques with the 1918 virus or a contemporary flu strain 3 . Whereas the contemporary virus caused mild symptoms in the lungs, the 1918 flu spread quickly throughout the respiratory system and the monkeys died within days. The damage parallels reports of human patients in 1918. The team reports that the 1918 virus caused the monkeys' immune systems to go into overdrive, causing immune proteins to be expressed at abnormally high levels and attack the body \u2014 what immunologists call a cytokine storm. The research suggests that 1918 flu might work in a similar way to other viruses, such as West Nile, that can also cause a massive auto-immune reaction. This suggests a route towards treatment, says Michael Gale, a virologist at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center. Drugs that target over-zealous immune responses, such as those that control an immune protein called interleukin-6, are being developed for other diseases. Tweaked versions might work for pandemic flu. But despite the promise of treatments, the results echo what had already been found in mice, and Gale feels there is a more important issue to be addressed. \u201cThe pathogenesis is interesting,\u201d he says. \u201cBut the key question is: how was it spread so efficiently?\u201d A team at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine has already started to investigate. Peter Palese is working with Adolfo Garcia-Sastre and Jeffery Taubenberger, who first reconstructed the virus, to find out how it spreads. Working with ferrets, they have found that a change of only one or two amino acids in the flu sequence is enough to stop transmission. They will publish the result in  Science . Identifying which sections of the genome are responsible for transmission \u201chas huge predictive value for whether strains will become pandemic or not\u201d, says Guus Rimmelzwaan at the World Health Organization's National Influenza Centre in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. The next move for Kawaoka's team is along similar lines \u2014 they will be swapping sections in and out of the virus to establish exactly which bits make it so lethal. But the latest results haven't assuaged everyone's concerns. Richard Ebright, a bacteriologist at Rutgers University, New Jersey, believes the virus should never have been recreated. \u201cThe key implication is that the material is now present in at least two locations,\u201d he says. The new study, he argues, increases the risk that the virus could escape and sets \u201ca dangerous precedent\u201d for other labs to follow. Ebright argues that publishing the study in  Nature , when similar research on more mundane pathogens regularly appears in lower-impact journals, could in itself increase the proliferation risk, if it tempts research groups to work on high-risk pathogens simply to get more recognition. Similar views were expressed off the record by other scientists. Ritu Dhand,  Nature 's chief biological sciences editor, defends the decision to publish, arguing that because the 1918 virus is not like other flu viruses, gaining insight into what makes it is so virulent in humans is of scientific interest. Gale agrees that understanding the 1918 flu strain better could have huge public-health benefits. But he says there might be better ways to study this, and admits that some research might be driven as much by historical interest as by the potential health benefits. Jens Kuhn, a virologist at Harvard Medical School who advises on arms control, also feels divided. \u201cEverything I say, I make 'enemies' on one or the other side,\u201d he says. \u201cI am torn sometimes between the two worlds.\u201d \n                     Controlling immune response may cut bird flu death rate \n                   \n                     Deadly flu virus can be sent through the mail \n                   \n                     The 1918 flu virus is resurrected \n                   \n                     Bird flu in focus \n                   \n                     1918 influenza pandemic web focus \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

He admitted creating some 900 fictitious patients in a 2005  Lancet  paper on the effect of certain painkillers on oral cancer risk in smokers, since retracted. An independent commission of inquiry was set up to discern the details of the fraud; last June it reported that the bulk of Sudb\u00f8's 30-plus publications were invalid because of the fabrication and manipulation of data. Sudb\u00f8 resigned the day after the commission released its report and was stripped of his medical and discipline degrees late last year. He is reportedly still in Oslo with his family but not working. Richard Horton, editor of  The Lancet , co-hosted a meeting in Norway last month to establish what could be learnt from the case. He thinks that because Sudb\u00f8 used public funds to pay for fraudulent work, he will probably face criminal proceedings.  Lucy Odling-Smee \n               THEREZA IMANISHI-KARI \n             A 1986 paper in  Cell  on immunity in transgenic mice acquired international fame \u2014 not because of what it reported, but because of the slew of investigations it spurred. Among the paper's authors were Thereza Imanishi-Kari and Nobel laureate David Baltimore, then both at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. A postdoc in Imanishi-Kari's lab accused her of falsifying data in the  Cell  paper. The decade-long saga that followed involved a series of investigations, including one by the Energy and Commerce Congressional committee. Imanishi-Kari was cleared of all charges in 1996. After doing no research for ten years, Imanishi-Kari reorganized a research programme at Tufts University in Medford, Massachusetts. Although pleased with the response of colleagues to her publications, she feels the case still overshadows her grant applications. \u201cBeing a woman in science is one kind of handicap; being wrongly accused is another,\u201d she says. Henry Wortis, one of Imanishi-Kari's collaborators at Tufts, says people should judge her by her current work, published in leading journals such as  Immunity . \u201cThat's the quality of work she's been unable to do for ten years,\u201d he says. \u201cIt's been a considerable loss to research.\u201d  Lucy Odling-Smee \n               JAN HENDRIK SCH\u00d6N \n             The fraud that came to light in the spring of 2002 is by far the most serious to strike physics in recent years. Jan Hendrik Sch\u00f6n was a rising star at Lucent Technologies' prestigious Bell Laboratories in Murray Hill, New Jersey, and author of a string of papers in  Nature  and  Science . His reputation collapsed following a Bell Labs report that found Sch\u00f6n guilty of falsifying data in at least 16 papers on the electronic properties of new materials, such as organic films that might one day replace silicon-based electronics. Sch\u00f6n's whereabouts are now unknown, and he has declined to comment on his research while investigations are continuing (the University of Konstanz in Germany is still assessing the work he did to earn his PhD there in the mid-1990s). But shock waves from the case have hit physicists, mainly in the shape of new research guidelines. Some of Sch\u00f6n's co-authors were criticized for not spotting their colleague's misconduct, prompting the American Physical Society to issue new rules stating that co-authors should be accountable for important data in papers they sign off.  Jim Giles \n               ANDERS PAPE M\u00d8LLER \n             In late 2003, the Danish Committees on Scientific Dishonesty concluded that Anders Pape M\u00f8ller, one of the world's leading experts in behavioural ecology, was guilty of 'scientific dishonesty'. A former colleague, J\u00f8rgen Rab\u00f8l, had accused M\u00f8ller of using flawed data in a paper published in the journal  Oikos . The paper has since been retracted. Unconvinced, the National Council for Scientific Research in Paris, where M\u00f8ller was and is still based, appointed an independent 'committee of wise men' to examine the case. In late 2004, the committee concluded that M\u00f8ller was innocent: although it found that good lab practices hadn't been followed, it could not prove intent to commit scientific fraud. M\u00f8ller did not respond to invitations for interview. An impressive publication list in the past two years suggests that M\u00f8ller's output has not been dimmed. But a collaborator, Timothy Mousseau at the University of South Carolina in Columbia, says that the consequences of the case rumble on. \u201cEven though a complete investigation found no evidence, people get emotionally caught up in these kinds of interactions. There is no easy way to clear your name.\u201d  Lucy Odling-Smee \n               WOO SUK HWANG \n             South Korea's stem-cell researcher Woo Suk Hwang is arguably the highest-profile scientific fraudster ever. In two hugely cited papers in  Science  in 2004 and 2005, Hwang claimed to have derived stem cells from cloned human embryos. But on 10 January 2006, Seoul National University announced after a four-week investigation that all of his claims were fabricated. The legal issues have been harder to clear up than the scientific ones. Prosecutors started an investigation the day that the university report was released, and delivered their own report on 12 May 2006. They charged Hwang with fraud, embezzlement, and violation of the country's bioethics law. But more than half-a-dozen hearings later, the court has still not reached a conclusion. The proceedings have not prevented Hwang from doing research: he is now carrying out animal cloning experiments at his new laboratory in Yongjin, 50 kilometres south of Seoul.  David Cyranoski \n               SHINICHI FUJIMURA \n             In the 1980s and 1990s, amateur archaeologist Shinichi Fujimura was known throughout Japan for his 'divine hands', thanks to his discovering a string of stone artefacts that dated back to 700,000 years ago. Then in 2000, Japanese newspaper  Mainichi Shimbun  published photos of Fujimura digging holes to bury tools that he later announced as major finds, and he confessed to fraud. The Japanese Archaeological Association released the results of its final investigation in 2004. It concluded that all of the 168 sites dug by Fujimura had been faked \u2014 forcing Japanese history textbooks to rewrite their descriptions of the Palaeolithic period. The Tohoku Paleolithic Institute, where Fujimura held the post of deputy director, was also dissolved in 2004. Fujimura, aged 56 years, was hospitalized for mental illness, and then reportedly remarried, changed his name and is now living quietly in a small town near the Pacific coast.  Ichiko Fuyuno \n               LUK VAN PARIJS \n             Once considered an exciting prospect in immunology and RNA interference, Luk Van Parijs was sacked from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Cambridge in October 2005 after admitting that he had altered data in a published paper, unpublished manuscripts and grant applications. The institute inquiry that prompted the confession was sparked by allegations from some of his lab members. Surprisingly, Van Parijs has co-authored a publication since the scandal, on a paper published in  The Prostate  in February 2006. The study's first author \u2014 urologist Qiang Zhang of Northwestern University in Chicago, Illinois \u2014 says that he and his co-authors included Van Parijs as an author because he had provided helpful ideas when giving a seminar in Zhang's department a few years earlier. He and other collaborators contacted by  Nature  have not communicated with Van Parijs since he left MIT.  Lucy Odling-Smee \n               BENG\u00dc SEZEN \n             In March 2006, Dalibor Sames, a chemist at Columbia University in New York, withdrew two papers and part of a third from the  Journal of the American Chemical Society  ( JACS ). Work done by graduate student Beng\u00fc Sezen, he said, couldn't be reproduced. The work was in the field of carbon\u2013hydrogen bond functionalization, which aims to selectively break bonds within a molecule. The case got a lot of coverage on the ever-lively chemistry blogs, and a few press outlets mentioned the issue, including ( Nature   440 , 390\u2013391; doi:10.1038/440390c 2006) . Sames is not commenting further until an inquiry is completed, and Columbia University says that it is against its policy to \u201ccomment on the existence or non-existence of any internal investigation into allegations of research misconduct\u201d. But Sezen has vigorously defended herself in e-mails to the editor of  JACS  and the press.  Emma Marris \n               How much fraud? \n             Statistics relating to the prevalence of scientific fraud and misconduct are sparse. But here are a few. \n               United States \n             Of 3,247 researchers funded by the National Institutes of Health who responded to a survey, 1.4% admitted to plagiarism and 0.3% admitted to falsification of data. 15.5% of responders said that they had changed the design, methodology or results of a study in response to pressure from a funding source (B. C. Martinson  et al .  Nature   435 , 737\u2013738; 2005). In 2005, the Office of Research Integrity received 265 allegations of misconduct. Of 22 cases that it closed in that year, research misconduct was found in eight. Of these eight cases, three were for falsification; two involved falsification and fabrication; two involved fabrication; and one involved plagiarism. \n               United Kingdom \n             Of 13 cases of suspected fraud brought to the Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE) between 1998 and 2003, seven were given up because of lack of documentation or lack of a response from the author or institution. \n               Japan \n             Of 1,323 research institutes that responded to a Science Council of Japan survey in 2006, only 13.4% had guidelines on what behaviours are defined as misconduct and how to act if misconduct is reported. Just 12.4% of institutes had discussed dishonest behaviour with their researchers in the past ten years. \n               Germany \n             The ombudsmen of the German Research Foundation (DFG) were called in 45 cases of misconduct in 2004, and took up 36 of them. Of these 36 cases, misconduct was found in one investigation. \n               Denmark \n             Of 25 investigations that were concluded by the Danish Committees on Scientific Dishonesty between 2003 and 2005, dishonest behaviour was found in two of them. \n                     Leading by example \n                   \n                     Misconduct?

{"file_id": "445240a", "url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/445240a", "year": 2007, "authors": [], "parsed_as_year": "2006_or_before", "body": "The legal quagmire, strain and bad press of misconduct investigations leave many universities tempted to ignore misconduct allegations. But getting an investigation right can reduce the pain and boost an institution's reputation, says Geoff Brumfiel. Rumours were flying at Purdue University nuclear engineering school in West Lafayette, Indiana, late in 2005. A recently hired physicist, Rusi Taleyarkhan, claimed to be pioneering a new form of energy called bubble fusion. But researchers both in and outside Purdue had concerns. Questions ranged from whether the neutron radiation in his experiment was from fusion or another source, to whether a supposedly independent confirmation of his findings was ghostwritten by Taleyarkhan. Lefteri Tsoukalas, then dean of the school, asked the administration to launch a misconduct investigation. What happened next Tsoukalas describes as \u201ca real eye-opener\u201d. For a month, he says, the administration ignored his request. An inquiry began only in March 2006, after  Nature  reported his and others' concerns (see  Nature   440 , 132; doi;10.1038/440132b 2006 ). But even since then, Tsoukalas says, little has been done. In October 2006, he resigned (see  Nature 444, 664; 2006 ), saying that he has \u201clittle faith that Purdue is capable of running a research integrity investigation\u201d. Taleyarkhan has denied all wrong-doing. Purdue declines to comment. The situation benefits no one, but is far from unique. Research ethicists and university misconduct officers say that academia's handling of scientific misconduct is often capricious and incomplete. Reasons are complex, but essentially come down to three issues: investigations are laborious; they require legal and scientific expertise that administrators often don't have; and universities may fear that a guilty verdict will stain their reputation. Countries vary in their approaches, but a look at US universities highlights the problem. Many ethicists told  Nature  the system is riddled with inconsistencies. \u201cI wouldn't even go so far as to glorify the current arrangement as 'a system',\u201d says Arthur Caplan, a bioethicist at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. \n               Little guidance \n             Most US misconduct proceedings follow a similar arc. If an accusation is received, administrators launch a preliminary inquiry. If that finds enough evidence, the university can open a full investigation. But beyond that, there's little guidance. Organizations such as the National Academies and the government's Office of Research Integrity (ORI) provide guidelines on research conduct, but no single document lays out investigative procedures. Trouble can begin before the inquiry, says Kristina Gunsalus, a lawyer at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, who has led many proceedings. It's often unclear where whistleblowers should take their concerns, so young students end up discussing them with senior colleagues. The gossip that follows can damage the accused and prejudice an inquiry. Whistleblowers can also be the target of reprisals. Young people in particular are rarely protected, according to Barbara Redman, dean of nursing at Wayne State University in Detroit, Michigan, who has studied the issue. \u201cPolicies are incomplete,\u201d she says. Many lose their jobs, regardless of the outcome of their allegations. Once an investigation starts, it can quickly enter legal limbo. Misconduct is not a legal charge, so in one sense it comes down to university policy. But if anyone is defamed, the university can find itself with a libel case. So it has a strong incentive to be secretive. Then there's the pressure on investigators, generally scientists at the university, who are expected to serve as judge and jury to their colleagues. This can be awkward. Proceedings are often protracted and complex, with months of hearing testimony and evidence. \u201cEvery committee I have ever worked with comes back with these enormous circles under their eyes,\u201d says Gunsalus. \u201cI cannot overstate the costs of these procedures for the people involved.\u201d In part because the panels are made up of working scientists, they can deliver unexpected results. One recent example is the University of Pittsburgh's investigation into Gerald Schatten, an obstetrics professor. Schatten collaborated heavily with disgraced stem-cell scientist Woo Suk Hwang of Seoul National University (SNU) in South Korea. The SNU's investigation found that Hwang had faked many of his acclaimed cloning results, and a panel at Pittsburgh was charged with determining whether Schatten was also guilty of misconduct. The panel concluded he was not, but found him guilty of 'research misbehaviour' \u2014 a term undefined by university policy and not included in the original charges. \u201cWhat does it mean and what are the consequences?\u201d asks Gunsalus. \u201cI wish they had done better.\u201d It's not surprising that the legal quagmire, strain and bad press leave many universities tempted to ignore allegations. \u201cUniversities have an incentive not to pursue them,\u201d says Redman. \u201cThey don't want to disgrace their faculty,\u201d adds Caplan. \u201cIt hurts morale.\u201d Similar problems exist elsewhere. In Britain, for example, major funding bodies such as the research councils and the Wellcome Trust only award grants to universities that have established systems for dealing with misconduct allegations. But there is no body with the power to oversee investigations when they occur. What can be done? One possible solution is to take investigations out of universities' hands and pass them to an independent body. But this can be controversial, as scientists don't take kindly to investigation by outsiders. The ORI briefly tried to take the lead in the late 1980s, but its heavy-handedness and lack of scientific expertise led to a backlash, according to Caplan: \u201cThe ORI blundered around like a brontosaurus in the research misconduct park.\u201d Today, the ORI takes a lower-key role, providing guidelines and reviewing cases involving federal funds. Despite the failings of universities, most people now agree that in a country such as the United States, with a highly privatized university system, it's best to handle misconduct investigations on campus. \u201cThere are no better alternatives,\u201d says Gunsalus. Scandinavian countries seem to fare better with independent supervision. In Denmark, whistleblowers can turn to a government body called the Danish Committees on Scientific Dishonesty (DCSD) if they think university boards have not investigated a claim properly. Finland and Norway have similar committees. Although some of the DCSD's decisions have been controversial, such as when it criticized climate sceptic Bj\u00f8rn Lomborg for cherry-picking data in his 2001 book  The Skeptical Environmentalist , it is generally seen as a model for small countries in which it is hard to find independent investigators at the local level. However, even DCSD member Vagn Lundsgaard Hansen, a mathematician at the Technical University of Denmark in Lyngby, believes claims should be dealt with by the university concerned where possible. One way to help universities is to establish common systems and guidelines \u2014 although persuading them to comply isn't easy. After Germany's main funding agency, the DFG, asked universities to adopt guidelines in the late 1990s, it finally had to threaten to withdraw eligibility for funding if they didn't comply by mid-2002. The guidelines include establishment of university and DFG ombudsmen to whom whistleblowers can turn with concerns about a lab, and a committee that adjudicates on cases forwarded to it by the ombudsmen. The universities reluctantly adopted the guidelines. But the ombudsmen expressed concern last October that universities are still not taking referred cases seriously. They complained that university presidents and rectors play down cases, particularly concerns brought by young scientists against more senior colleagues. And when investigations do get started they drag on. The ombudsmen pledged to increase pressure on universities to improve \u2014 perhaps by requiring DFG grant application forms to refer to the university's guidelines, thus forcing department heads, who co-sign applications, to explicitly endorse them. The key may be to convince universities that getting it right can bolster their reputation. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Cambridge was widely praised for its investigation of immunologist Luk van Parijs, begun in August 2004. MIT moved fast to determine if an investigation was needed, handled complaints confidentially, found him guilty of fabricating results and fired him in October 2005. Some Asian universities \u2014 once notorious for brushing misconduct claims under the carpet \u2014 are now showing the world how to conduct fast, fair and transparent investigations. \n               Quick justice \n             Last August members of a lab run by veteran biologist Akio Sugino at Osaka University claimed he had faked data in two papers. Two days later the biosciences school to which Sugino belonged formed an investigation committee, and released its conclusion that Sugino had fabricated data the next month. The 40-page report was published on the school's website and in December Sugino was dismissed. That month the University of Tokyo concluded its investigation, begun in April 2005, into RNA researcher Kazunari Taira and his assistant. It reported that they were unable to provide notebooks to back up their results or to reproduce their experiments and, although it stopped short of finding fraud, fired both. And in South Korea, the SNU completed its investigation into Hwang in four weeks, publishing its 50-page report on 10 January 2006. Hisato Kondoh, dean of Osaka University's biosciences school, describes the secret of a successful investigation. \u201cIt's important to judge things based on facts, and make the results open as soon as possible, while protecting the rights of people who both reported allegations and are suspected,\u201d he says. \u201cIf the investigation takes time, everybody gets exhausted. Settling the case at the earliest possible opportunity and bringing the situation back to normal benefits all of us.\u201d \n                 With additional reporting by Alison Abbott, David Cyranoski, Ichiko Fuyuno, Jim Giles and Lucy Odling-Smee.

A sweeping proposal for a common energy policy for Europe, unveiled last week by the European Commission, calls for a radical shift towards a low-carbon economy. Although environmental campaigners have criticized the proposal for not going far enough, other experts say that the plan is much more ambitious and concrete than any suggested before. The commission recommends a combination of regulatory and technological measures to secure the future energy supply of the European Union (EU) and to reduce the risk of dangerous climate change. It says that the package would help to cut the EU's greenhouse-gas emissions by at least 20% (compared with 1990 levels) by 2020. The commission suggests that renewable energy sources in the EU should make up 20% of the overall energy mix by 2020. Energy generated from wind, solar and other renewable sources currently account for less than 7% of total energy consumption. The commission also calls for biofuels to provide at least 10% of the energy used by the transport sector by 2020. Imported fossil fuels are projected to remain the main source of energy, however, and the proposed policy includes a commitment to equip the next generation of coal-fired power plants with the technology to capture and store carbon dioxide, which would enable them to operate with low or zero greenhouse-gas emissions. It is the first time that the use of such technology has been proposed at such a high political level. The report will be discussed by the EU's heads of state at a summit meeting in March. If approved, the recommendations must be translated into national law in all 27 member states. Policy analysts doubt that all the proposed actions and targets will be accepted. But given the vagueness of previous reviews, experts say that they appreciate the concreteness and level of detail of the proposed changes. \u201cWe can improve our prospects for energy security and carbon emissions if these recommendations are followed through, even though it will be difficult to get agreement on all of them,\u201d says John Mitchell, an associate fellow with the energy environment and development programme at London-based Chatham House. And the energy industry, although critical about some of the details, has welcomed the main thrust of the report. \u201cWe do know that our fossil future is limited,\u201d says a spokeswoman for the Germany energy company RWE. The most controversial part of the proposal may be the call for a single energy market within the EU. The report calls for trade barriers to be lifted and for the production of energy to be separated from its distribution, to increase competition and allow citizens to choose to buy 'green' energy if they want to as well as reducing dependence on any one source of energy. In the past, energy companies in Germany and France have blocked such moves, and they are expected to keep up their resistance. The technology does not yet exist to achieve all the targets suggested by the commission. So the report says that investment in research into energy efficiency and clean energy, including nuclear power, should be increased by 50%. The commission plans to detail suggested research goals and spending in a separate plan to be released later this year. But it does say that up to 12 large-scale demonstration projects of different capture and storage technologies should be built by 2015. Champions of carbon sequestration have greeted the plan as a vital step towards setting climate-friendly performance standards for use of fossil fuels. But given the time it will take to develop the necessary technology, they urge policymakers to get cracking. \u201cTime is of the essence,\u201d says Jonathan Gibbins, an energy engineer at Imperial College London. \u201cThe technology must be very strongly proven, which is why you cannot get on top of this too early.\u201d To meet the 2020 goal, he says that spending would need to be authorized within a year from now. Energy and climate issues will be priorities for the EU in the first half of this year. They will also be on the agenda of the G8 meeting in June, and commission president Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso hopes that the firm commitment by the EU to cut greenhouse-gas emissions will provide a nucleus for an international agreement that is at least as ambitious. The Kyoto Protocol, which requires developed countries to cut their 1990-level emissions by an average of 5.5%, runs out in 2012. The commission believes that a renewed agreement should lead to an overall 30% cut in emissions from developed countries, including the United States, by 2020. But given its stagnant population and economy, experts say it might be less painful for the EU to significantly cut emissions than for the more dynamic US market. \u201cWhat the commission wants sounds good for Europe, but you must put yourself in other people's shoes,\u201d says Gibbins. \u201cYou can't go to international negotiations and demand more pain from others than from yourself.\u201d Last week's commission report also contained a section on the costs of climate change, which argued that global warming must be limited to no more than 2 \u00b0C compared with pre-industrial levels if catastrophic consequences of warming are to be avoided. Among the projected consequences of inaction outlined in the report are reduced crop productivity in southern Europe compared with increased productivity in northern Europe, a greater number of heat-related deaths, damage due to flooding and negative impacts on tourism. \n                     How much will it cost to save the world? \n                   \n                     Solar energy: A new day dawning?: Silicon Valley sunrise \n                   \n                     Putting the carbon back: The hundred billion tonne challenge \n                   \n                     Capturing carbon \n                   \n                     Energy for a Cool Planet \n                   \n                     Climate change in focus \n                   \n                     Regional climate change special \n                   \n                     European Commission Climate Change Homepage \n                   \n                     European Commission-Energy for a Changing World \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

In a direct but possibly futile challenge to the only veto of George Bush's presidency, the US Congress is expected to pass a bill for a second time that would dramatically expand researchers' access to human embryonic stem-cell lines. As  Nature  went to press, a vote in the House of Representatives was expected on 11 January, with the Senate likely to act on an identical measure within a few weeks. The bill would allow federal funds to be used for research on stem-cell lines derived from surplus embryos at fertility clinics and otherwise slated for destruction. The embryos would have to be donated with informed consent and without payment or other inducements. The California-based Rand Corporation estimated in 2003 that about 11,000 of the roughly 400,000 embryos stored at US fertility clinics at that time were available for research, from which it should be possible to derive up to 275 cell lines (D. I. Hoffman  et al .  Fertil. Steril .  79,  1063\u20131069; 2003). The study's lead author, David Hoffman of IVF Florida Reproductive Associates in Margate, estimates that there may now be 10\u201315% more embryos in storage. Under current Bush administration policy, only around 20 stem-cell lines, all created before 9 August 2001, are available to federally funded researchers. These ageing lines are contaminated by having been grown on 'feeder' layers of mouse cells, making them impractical for developing human therapies. Bush vetoed an identical bill last summer after both the House and Senate passed it, and the House failed by 51 votes to muster the two-thirds majority needed to override his veto (see  Nature   442 , 335; 2006). Bush is likely to veto the bill again, and even with Democratic election gains in November, it is doubtful whether stem-cell supporters in the House have the votes to override Bush. Just 13 of the House members who voted with Bush last summer were defeated in November. And seven of the newly elected Democrats are anti-abortion. But in the Senate, which passed the bill by 63 to 37 last summer, November's elections ushered in a net gain of three senators who are likely to approve of the measure, bringing supporters within one vote of a veto-proof majority. If the Senate did override a second Bush veto, pressure on House members to do the same could substantially increase. The Democrats, newly in charge of the House and Senate, have made it an early priority to reintroduce the bill, now dubbed the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act of 2007. \u201cThere is growing support for ethical embryonic stem-cell research in Congress, which is caused by a solid public consensus supporting this research,\u201d Representative Diana DeGette (Democrat, Colorado), one of the bill's two House authors, told  Nature  shortly before she introduced the bill on 5 January. Opponents such as Senator Sam Brownback (Republican, Kansas) are not persuaded. \u201cRight now, the private sector can spend all it wants on destructive human embryonic stem-cell research, but such research is producing no human applications. There is simply no need to waste taxpayer dollars on this,\u201d says Becky Ogilvie, a spokeswoman for Brownback. Critics arguing that human embryonic stem-cell research is unnecessary were given ammunition on 7 January when  Nature Biotechnology  published a paper from a group led by Anthony Atala, director of the Institute for Regenerative Medicine at Wake Forest University in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. The researchers reported isolating stem cells from human amniotic fluid that can differentiate  in vitro  into many of the same major cell types as embryonic stem cells (P. De Coppi  et al .  Nature Biotechnol.  doi:10.1038/nbt1274; 2006). The study provides \u201cyet another reason why there is no need to destroy young human embryos in order to obtain their biological parts\u201d, Brownback said in a statement. Supporters of the bill shot back. \u201cThis study...in no way replaces the need for expanding the [US government's] embryonic stem-cell policy,\u201d Representative Michael Castle (Republican, Delaware), the other author of the House bill, said in his own statement. Some supporters hope to amend the bill to make it more politically palatable to hesitant senators and more difficult for Bush to veto \u2014 perhaps by incorporating support for research on stem cells from adult sources. But Bush has adamantly opposed expanded federal funding. DeGette notes that she asked to meet the president in November. Last week, she got a response from Bush's appointments secretary. It read: \u201cThe president would appreciate an opportunity to visit with you. Regrettably it will not be possible for us to arrange such a meeting at this time.\u201d Democratic senator Tom Harkin of Iowa, a leading supporter of the bill, vows to fight a second veto. On 4 January, the day the bill was introduced in the Senate, he said: \u201cWe will use every legislative means at our disposal to ensure that [the bill] is enacted into law.

{"file_id": "445234b", "url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/445234b", "year": 2007, "authors": [{"name": "Michael Hopkin"}], "parsed_as_year": "2006_or_before", "body": "Academics say published fossil finds should be available for study. A controversial new 'amateur' palaeontology journal has angered academic researchers, who fear that the project will give a sheen of scientific legitimacy to the dealings of commercial fossil hunters. The organizers of the  Journal of Paleontological Sciences , launched this month, say that it will publish details of privately held fossils, bringing them in from the \u201cscientific darkness\u201d. But traditional palaeontologists say that the journal undermines the field and could fuel the black market in fossil specimens. The journal is inviting anyone, including commercial fossil hunters and keen amateur collectors, to publish details of their finds. \u201cLurking in many private collections are valuable fossil treasures. This is the first journal that gives an outlet to the amateur and commercial palaeontologist to try their hand at writing a scientific article,\u201d says Ken Carpenter, a member of the journal's publication committee and curator of vertebrate palaeontology at the Denver Museum of Nature and Science in Colorado. But academics are upset that the fossils will not be in the public domain, and will therefore be unavailable for future study. \u201cThis is absolutely imperative in order for our science to exist,\u201d says Mark Goodwin at the University of California Museum of Paleontology in Berkeley. Palaeontologists who publish their results in traditional journals, such as the  Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology , agree to abide by a code of ethics, whereby they catalogue their specimens in a recognized repository, most often a national museum. Goodwin thinks that the new journal is an attempt to circumvent this practice. The fears are fuelled by the fact that many of the fossils that change hands in commercial deals do so on the black market. \u201cPromotion of this online journal will encourage the commercialization of vertebrate palaeontology, which unfortunately results in increased illegal collecting activities on public lands in the United States, and the illegal trade and export of fossils from China, other regions of Asia, and the former Soviet Union,\u201d Goodwin argues. Walter Stein, chair of the journal's publication committee and president of PaleoAdventures in Belle Fourche, South Dakota, disagrees. He thinks that some exposure for the privately held specimens is better for science than none at all, even if the fossils themselves remain behind closed doors. He adds that there will always be \u201cten per cent of academics we will never convince, who think we are only in it for the money\u201d. In an apparent bid to deflect accusations that they are interested mainly in promoting commercialization of the field, the journal's publishers have changed their name from the American Association of Paleontological Suppliers to the Association of Applied Paleontological Sciences. The nine-member publication committee will review submissions before drawing on a 22-member pool of potential peer reviewers. \u201cIf you can prove it, we will publish it,\u201d Stein says. Goodwin says that the palaeontologists who have agreed to review submissions \u201cshould be ashamed of themselves\u201d, adding that their efforts would be better spent encouraging private collectors who hold fossils to consider other means of allowing access and study. Donating fossils to a museum and enlisting the help of an academic researcher would ensure that the fossils can be studied in perpetuity, he argues. \u201cWhen this occurs, science wins over greed.\u201d Commercial fossil trading in the United States has its roots in the 1960s, when private landowners began to realize the potential value of fossils found on their property, causing academic researchers on tight grants to worry that they were being priced out of the field. Typically, the owner of a property can expect to receive up to 25% of the sale value of a specimen, and some US landowners reportedly earn as much as $25,000 a year from the practice. Many collectors also buy fossils as an investment, similar to dealing in artworks or antiques, which fuels the activities of commercial fossil brokers. In a bid to confront these activities, the US government offers a tax deduction on individuals or estates who donate specimens to national museums. Many museums offer to make a high-quality cast in exchange for the genuine article, in a bid to encourage collectors to donate their treasures. \n                     Don't wash those fossils! \n                   \n                     Ethiopian plan for Lucy tour splits museums \n                   \n                     Teenager waits 40 years for recognition \n                   \n                     Dinosaur eggs escape sale as smuggling claims unearthed \n                   \n                     Dinosaurs in focus \n                   \n                     Business news \n                   \n                     Ecology and evolution news \n                   \n                     Policy news \n                   \n                     Journal of Paleontological Sciences \n                   \n                     Society of Vertebrate Paleontology \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Zero is not an option, says Heidi Ledford. Steve Linscombe still isn't quite sure how it happened. The director of the Louisiana State University AgCenter for Rice Research knows that he grew a few lines of transgenic rice in field trials between 2001 and 2003. He also knows that one of those lines, LLRICE601, was grown on less than one acre. What he is not clear on is how the line then wended its way into the food supply. That little mystery is now the subject of an official investigation and a class-action lawsuit. When the escape was announced in August last year, LLRICE601 had not been approved for human consumption. The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) rushed to deregulate the crop, granting permission on 24 November for LLRICE601 to be grown without a permit. By then, Japan had already declared a month-long ban on all imports of US long-grain rice, and the European Union had started to require all US long-grain rice imports to be tested and certified at the expense of the exporters. Meanwhile, Bayer CropScience, the company that created the rice strain, put the blame squarely on farmers and an \u201cact of God\u201d. By that logic, this would not be the first time that a deity has aided and abetted the escape of a genetically engineered crop. On 21 December, Syngenta was fined $1.5 million for allowing its unapproved pest-resistant  Bt 10 corn (maize) to mix into seed distributed for food. The past decade is smattered with examples of unapproved crops sneaking through containment barriers (see ' Some past escapes '). When they make it into the food supply \u2014 as with LLRICE601 and  Bt 10 \u2014 public outcry and financial losses follow. But amid the calls for tighter regulations, experts say one truth is being drowned out: no amount of regulation can guarantee that these crops will not escape and multiply. Meanwhile, the stakes are getting higher. Since 1991, the USDA has approved nearly 400 field tests of crops that produce pharmaceutical and industrial compounds, leaving many concerned that future escapes could have severe consequences for human health. A close call came in 2002, when stalks of corn designed to produce a pig vaccine were found mixed with $2.7-million worth of Nebraska soya beans destined for human consumption. Prodigene, the corn's maker, was fined $250,000 and forced to buy and destroy the soya beans. \n               No guarantees \n             Although the use of transgenic crops is spreading around the globe, production is still concentrated in the United States, which grows more than half of the world's genetically engineered crops. There, they are monitored by three regulatory agencies: the USDA regulates field tests, the Environmental Protection Agency monitors crops genetically engineered to produce pesticides, and the Food and Drug Administration provides a voluntary 'consultation' on the safety of crops for human consumption. That voluntary consultation sets the United States apart from many other countries, including China and many European countries, which require crops to be evaluated for toxicity and allergenicity before being approved. In the 20 years since the USDA started to regulate field tests, it has approved nearly 50,000 field sites. But an internal audit commissioned by the USDA inspector-general and released on 22 December 2005 was severely critical. The report admonished the agency for lacking basic information about test sites, failing to inspect field tests sufficiently, and neglecting the fate of the crops after testing. USDA regulator Rebecca Besch says that a year on, many of the report's recommendations have been enacted. The agency now asks for detailed coordinates of field test sites, she says, and is revising its environmental standards. Jeffrey Wolt, an agronomist at Iowa State University in Ames, commends the USDA for its efforts, but says that tougher regulations are no guarantee of confinement. \u201cThere has been this strong effort by regulators and industry to tighten this stuff up,\u201d he says. \u201cBut no matter how much you ratchet it down, the risk is not going to be absolute zero because that's a scientific impossibility.\u201d Other scientists agree. Transgenic plants have many ways to escape. For plants pollinated by wind and insects, such as canola, pollen transfer is a constant threat. And although seed harvesting and processing equipment is designed to keep different varieties apart, there is no guarantee of success. \u201cJust like anything, it is not 100%,\u201d says Linscombe. \u201cYou could have a seed that gets caught somewhere in a planter and later jars itself loose.\u201d And of course even if only a few seeds make their way into breeding stock, their numbers can then multiply. Meanwhile, says Michelle Marvier, an ecologist at Santa Clara University in California, the focus on designing effective biological containment has kept attention away from an even more slippery culprit: human error. \u201cThe reality is that humans are involved, and we inevitably make mistakes.\u201d She warns that any risk evaluation of a genetically engineered crop should consider that crop likely to escape. Several countries have opted not to take that risk. After the news of LLRICE601 contamination, major exporters in Vietnam announced that they would not be growing any transgenic rice. And even some countries that grow genetically modified crops are cautious about the ones they will accept. Argentina, for example, the world's second largest producer, refuses to grow any genetically engineered crop that has not been approved for consumption in its major export markets, including the European Union. That policy is intended to prevent unintended mixing of crops from hurting Argentina's robust agricultural export sector (although it hasn't protected neighbouring Brazil \u2014 which did not allow genetically engineered crops until last year \u2014 from repeated contamination from Argentina's transgenic stocks). \n               Harsh punishments \n             In the United States, the idea is that escape can be prevented if producers know that they will be punished if unapproved plant material is detected in the food supply. If a company is responsible for contamination, it typically has to remove the unapproved material at its own expense, and as an additional deterrent, deal with the flurry of negative press that undoubtedly follows. \u201cIt is really bad for the reputation of these firms and the technology itself,\u201d says Guillaume Gruere, an agricultural economist at the International Food Policy Research Institute in Washington DC. But he says that the regulatory agencies' zero-tolerance policy clashes with the inevitability of escape. \u201cThe problem is the threshold. If you want zero percent, it's going to be pretty much impossible.\u201d And despite the negative press, US public opinion of genetically modified crops seems to have been changed little by the escapes so far, judging from the results of a survey done by the Pew Initiative on Food and Biotechnology last year. The number of Americans who approve of genetically modified food has hovered unchanged at around 26% for the past five years, whereas the number that explicitly disapproves has shrunk from 58% to 46%. What about crops that produce pharmaceuticals and industrial compounds? In 2003, the USDA issued stricter guidelines for containment of these plants. Isolation distances from food crops were increased, and field test sites were to be inspected more frequently. And so far, no such strains have been deregulated, meaning that they must always be contained no matter how well they are tested. But Margaret Mellon, director of the Union of Concerned Scientists' Food and Environment programme, doubts that those regulations will be enough. Her organization has called for a ban on the outdoor production of pharmaceuticals in food crops, arguing that the amount of regulation needed to guarantee containment would be prohibitively expensive both to the government and to researchers. The union has gone through the USDA regulations and analysed points at which transgenic crops could still escape, such as machine cleaning and seed transport. \u201cRegulations that are sufficiently stringent to plug all of those holes really are not feasible,\u201d says Mellon. \u201cWe see how much trouble the agency is having even with the current ones.\u201d Instead, she argues, production of pharmaceuticals or industrial compounds should take place only in non-food crops such as tobacco. The problem is that such a ban would have a chilling effect on research, because the technology for creating and processing transgenic food crops is well understood and therefore much cheaper. At this stage, a US ban seems unlikely, and no other country has an official ban on pharmaceutical-producing crops. In 2005, the Oregon Department of Agriculture convened a panel to evaluate the risks and potential economic benefits of growing animals and plants that produce pharmaceuticals in the state. The panel concluded last October that the benefits outweigh the risks. Back in Louisiana, Linscombe plans to enact a few new regulations of his own. After his experience with LLRICE601, he says that he will be taking drastic measures to separate any experimental crops from his breeding stock, to at least minimize the chance of contamination. He is considering buying separate processing equipment for genetically modified crops. And he plans to greatly exceed the typical three-metre distance that is required between strains. \u201cWe have two farms that are located five miles apart,\u201d he says. \u201cAny transgenic work in the future is going to be on one farm, and the breeding work on the other.\u201d \n                     Turning plants into protein factories \n                   \n                     Escaped Chinese GM rice reaches Europe \n                   \n                     US launches probe into sales of unapproved transgenic corn \n                   \n                     Syngenta's gaff embarrasses industry and White House \n                   \n                     Humans may spread GM seeds \n                   \n                     APHIS \n                   \n                     Bayer CropScience \n                   \n                     University of California, Riverside, Biotechnology Impacts Center \n                   \n                     Union of Concerned Scientists: Genetically modified food \n                   \n                     Iowa State University's Biosafety Institute for Genetically Modified Agricultural Products \n                   \n                     LSU AgCenter \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Washington DC The new Democrat-led US Congress convened on 4 January, but the changeover in power from a Republican-dominated Congress has thwarted almost anyone looking for government money. A budget impasse has erased the gains expected by several research agencies, and science advocates have launched an all-out lobbying campaign to win back the increases. At stake are large boosts proposed for the National Science Foundation (NSF), the Department of Energy's Office of Science and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). President George W. Bush proposed the increases last February, and Congress was supposed to hammer out the final numbers by 1 October 2006, the start of the 2007 fiscal year. But in December it became clear that the Republican Congress would be unable to complete the budget, leaving Democrats with the unsavoury task of finishing the Republican bills. The new chairs of the committees that dole out the money said last month that they would abandon the budget in favour of a year-long \u201ccontinuing resolution\u201d, which would keep funding for agencies at the previous year's levels. Now budget officials at science agencies are scrambling for options, which include cutting grants, delaying projects and even temporarily laying off staff. \u201cScience is in a very precarious position,\u201d says Joel Widder, a science lobbyist with the firm Lewis-Burke Associates in Washington DC. \u201cI think a lot of hopes and expectations will have to be put off.\u201d Particularly affected would be agencies favoured by President Bush's American Competitiveness Initiative, which aims to bolster US innovation (see  Nature   439 , 644\u2013645; 2006). That includes the energy department's science office, which had been expecting a 15\u201318% boost in its $3.6-billion budget. Meanwhile, Brookhaven National Laboratory in New York may temporarily shut down its Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, which was kept open last year only with the aid of a $13-million private donation. At the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory in Illinois, there are plans to shut down the Tevatron, the world's most powerful accelerator, and to lay off all staff without pay for a month, according to director Pier Oddone. And at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center in California, construction of the Linac Coherent Light Source will be deferred for a year, says Keith Hodgson, the lab's acting director. \u201cYou sound like you're whining, but the fact is that this comes after year after year of flat budgets,\u201d Hodgson notes. The science office hasn't seen a funding increase in roughly a decade. The NSF would also lose up to an expected 7.8% boost in its $5.6-billion budget. The agency was hoping to use the funds to increase the number of grants and launch its participation in the International Polar Year, says Jeff Nesbit, the NSF's director of legislative and public affairs. Under flat funding, he estimates that the agency would eliminate around 600 new grants, 10% of the number it was hoping to grant next year. Polar-year activities would also be jeopardized (see  'Shrunken heavyweight undermines polar year' ), as would the start of a new petascale computing centre. Plans for the new EarthScope programme of geological monitoring might have to be slowed, and travel has been severely curtailed.

Bangalore For several years, criticisms have been aired at India's scientific meetings and in its journals. Now the country's top politician has spoken out about the talent crisis and poor standards affecting Indian science. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh voiced his feelings on 3 January, when he opened the 94th Indian Science Congress (ISC) in Chidambaram in southern India. The annual meeting attracts thousands of scientists from across the country. Traditionally opened by the prime minister, it is generally an occasion to praise Indian science. But this year was different. \u201cWhile our government will do its utmost to invest in science, I call upon the scientific community to also invest its time and intellectual energy in the revitalization of our science institutions,\u201d said Singh. He added that he is \u201cdeeply concerned\u201d about declining enrolment in basic sciences, and said that the decaying university system \u201cneeds upgrading in a massive way\u201d. Singh was most troubled, he said, by \u201cthe decline in the standards of our research work in universities and even in advanced research institutes\u201d. For example, the return on billions of rupees invested in alternative energy sources was inadequate. \u201cBe it [hydropower], thermal or nuclear power, we have to improve the productivity of investments already made.\u201d To raise quality, Singh warned that he may submit India's research labs to international peer review. This is the first time that Singh has publicly criticized Indian science. His comments were apparently provoked by briefings from his science adviser, the distinguished chemist C. N. R. Rao, indicating that India publishes only 2.7% of the world's science papers (compared with China's 6%) and describing the flight of talent from government labs and universities to industry and abroad. \u201cIn the past year our government has launched three new research institutions,\u201d he told his audience, adding that the government is considering creating more. He also vowed to increase annual expenditure on science and technology from less than 1% of gross domestic product to 2% over the next five years. India's president A. P. J. Abdul Kalam welcomed Singh's assurance of extra science funding, but in his own address to the congress on 5 January pointed out that more than 20% of the country's science and technology budget in 2005\u201306 wasn't spent. He called for a plan for how future money will be used. Rao, who heads the Jawaharlal Nehru Centre for Advanced Scientific Research in Bangalore, says attracting and keeping scientists is tough when companies offer up to six times the salary of government labs: \u201cIn two years, I lost eight of my postdocs to the General Electric Company research centre next door.\u201d \n                     Indian lift-off a let-down \n                   \n                     Big Blue in deep \n                   \n                     Biobusiness in the rest of the world \n                   \n                     India outlook \n                   \n                     The Indian Science Congress Association \n                   \n                     Prime Minister Manmohan Singh \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

A genetic tweak has converted mice into endurance runners by enriching a little-known form of muscle fibre. The discovery could help boost sporting abilities, or reveal ways to slow muscle wasting. Human muscles are made of four main types of fibre, including two 'slow-twitch' varieties and one 'fast-twitch' muscle type that are suited to endurance and sprint activities respectively. Little has been known about the fourth type, called IIX fibre, because it is scattered throughout different muscles. Now a Boston team has hit upon a genetic switch that converts almost all mouse muscle fibres into type IIX. The result is startling. \"Damn, they're good athletes,\" says Bruce Spiegelman of Harvard Medical School, who led the team. The mice were able to run on a mouse treadmill for 25% longer than normal before reaching exhaustion. The discovery hints that the elusive type IIX muscle fibres are an underappreciated contributor to athletic ability. It is possible, for example, that world-class athletes are naturally endowed with more of these fibres than the average person \u2014 or that hard training generates more of them. If so, notes study researcher Zoltan Arany, also of Harvard Medical School, future athletes might try to take advantage of the discovery. It is possible, he predicts, that \"someday we'll have drugs that switch on the production of these fibres and they'll be abused by sportsmen\". Previous work has shown that boosting some muscle fibre types can help to slow muscle decay. So Arany notes that further studies into these fibres might one day help people who suffer from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or other conditions that waste away muscles.  \n              Twitchy \n            The different muscle fibre types have qualities that lend themselves to different types of activity. Slow-twitch fibres \u2014 types I and IIA \u2014 are packed with power-generating machines called mitochondria and are called into use mainly for continuous, endurance exercises such as walking that use up lots of oxygen. The soleus muscle in the calf, for example, is full of these fibres. Fast-twitch, or type IIB, fibres contract in shorter, sharper bursts, and tend to operate without oxygen. They are generally called upon for spurts of quick, powerful activity. The quadriceps, vital in sprinting, are rich in these fibres. Type IIX fibres are somewhere in between: they have lots of mitochondria but also contract quickly. One idea is that fibres go through a stage of being IIX during a conversion from fast-twitch to slow-twitch types, and that this might happen during certain forms of training. But their function is not known for certain.  \n              Designed to run \n            Four years ago, Spiegelman's team found that firing up a gene called PGC-1\u03b1 converted muscles that were a mix of fibre types into mainly slow-twitch fibres 1 . Their new work, published in  Cell Metabolism 2 , uses genetic engineering to switch on a sibling gene called PGC-\u03b2 in mice muscles. This transformed muscles that normally contain 15-20% type IIX fibres into ones with nearly 100%. The two genes are thought to help switch on entire cascades of genes that convert one muscle fibre type to another. Such studies allow researchers to examine in more detail how different muscle fibres behave, and how they affect physical ability. Scientists don't know exactly what enables particular people to succeed at marathons or ultra-endurance events such as ultramarathons (see  'Physiology: Freaks of nature?' ). Spiegelman says that he now wants to explore whether such athletes have a different form of PGC- \u03b2 or more IIX muscle fibres. \n             Visit our  \n             \n                 newsblog \n               \n              to read and post comments about this story. \n           \n                   Special: What are the limits? \n                 Reprints and Permissions"},

Last month, the president of fast-food chain Taco Bell appealed to his customers in full-page ads in  The New York Times  and other US newspapers. \u201cYou can be confident our food is safe to eat,\u201d his letter declared. The ads were the fallout from a food-poisoning outbreak traced to the chain's restaurants, which has affected at least 70 people across five states. The culprit was  Escherichia coli  O157:H7 \u2013 the same as in another outbreak this September and October linked to Californian spinach, which infected nearly 200 across the country and killed three. The outbreaks have thrown the spotlight on a bacterium that is difficult to detect and virtually impossible to treat or eradicate. \u201cWe see it more and more and we don't really know what to do about it,\u201d says microbiologist John Fairbrother of the University of Montreal, Canada. There are thousands of different strains of  E. coli , most of which are harmless. But O157 can make a potent toxin and latch onto intestinal cells, giving it the ability to cause kidney failure and even death. The bugs live harmlessly in cows' large intestine and are thought to be ubiquitous in cattle lots. Bacteria shed in faeces contaminate meat in slaughterhouses or find their way onto vegetables grown near animals or irrigated with water contaminated with manure, as is thought to have happened with the tainted spinach. Lettuce is thought to have spread the Taco Bell outbreak. There are now some promising research leads that might help prevent future outbreaks. At a meeting earlier this year on pathogenic  E. coli , veterinary researcher David Smith of the University of Nebraska, Lincoln, and his colleagues reported that a vaccine containing proteins from O157 cut the number of cows shedding bacteria by 60\u201370%. Canadian company Bioniche Life Sciences, based in Belleville, Ontario, has submitted the vaccine for regulatory approval in Canada, and plans to do so in the United States. Other groups are turning to viruses, called bacteriophages, that attack the O157 strain. A group led by microbiologist Todd Callaway of the US Department of Agriculture's Food and Feed Safety Research Unit in College Station, Texas, has found that feeding sheep a mixture of bacteriophages cuts the number of pathogenic bacteria in their guts by over 1,000 times. Cattle farmers may be forced to adopt vaccines or therapies because of pressure from food processors and the threat of lawsuits. But some microbiologists question whether these reductions will protect humans. Just ten cells of O157 are enough to infect a person, compared with hundreds of thousands needed for a  Salmonella  or cholera infection. \u201cIt's a very different standard for foods to meet,\u201d says James Kaper, an  E. coli  expert at the University of Maryland, Baltimore. He notes that irradiation would rid food of the bacteria but that the public, food industry and food-safety regulators have been reluctant to adopt it. So researchers are also working on treatments, for example with antibodies that inactivate the toxin. (Antibiotics aren't recommended for  E. coli  because by the time the infection is diagnosed, the bugs have usually released so much toxin that killing them doesn't help.) But researchers admit that the demand for such drugs is likely to be low. Perhaps an underestimated problem are other pathogenic  E. coli  strains, including O26, O111 and O145. These can also cause serious food poisoning but are more likely to go unnoticed, because lab tests are more difficult or not routine. These strains are more common outside the United States; in Italy, for example, most cases of  E. coli  food poisoning probably go undetected, says Alfredo Caprioli, who directs the  E. coli  reference lab at the Istituto Superiore di Sanit\u00e0 in Rome. There is intense interest in finding the exact combination of genes that make strains harmful to humans and quick ways to test for them. Ultimately researchers must find the critical points in the food supply at which intervention can most reduce contamination, says food scientist Don Schaffner of Rutgers University, New Jersey. \u201cObviously we haven't studied it enough to solve the problem.\u201d \n                     Mystery surrounds French oyster ban \n                   \n                     Bugs dress salad \n                   \n                     Food in focus \n                   \n                     CDC on E. coli outbreak \n                   \n                     PulseNet \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Bulgaria's accession to the European Union (EU) on 1 January will allow it to apply ever-greater international pressure in the political row over the fate of five Bulgarian nurses and a Palestinian doctor condemned to death in Libya last month. The six medical workers were sentenced to death on 19 December by the Benghazi Criminal Court for deliberately infecting more than 400 children with HIV at the Al-Fateh Hospital in Benghazi in 1998. Scientists around the world have argued that medical evidence shows unequivocally that the people were not infected deliberately. They point out that the outbreak was a typical example of what can go wrong when hospital equipment and supplies become contaminated \u2014 as happened in a hospital in Kazakhstan, where more than 80 children were infected with HIV last summer. The team defending the medical workers says that it will appeal the verdict to the Supreme Court in Libya. By law, this must be done within 60 days of the verdict. The Supreme Council for Judicial Authority could also annul the death sentences. The council, which makes judicial appointments, is an interface between Libya's supposedly separated executive and judiciary authorities. Although the strongest criticism of the verdict came from Bulgaria itself, both the EU and Germany, which holds the EU's presidency for the first half of 2007, forcefully condemned the sentences. Bulgaria's new status as an EU member state seems to ensure that this pressure will not slacken. \u201cWe simply cannot accept this verdict,\u201d says Benita Ferrero-Waldner, the European Commission's foreign minister. In a letter to the Libyan foreign ministry she pointed to the \u201crecent publication of a strong body of scientific evidence concerning the origin and timing of the Benghazi infection...I very much regret that this new element was not deemed worth considering in the legal proceedings thus far and hope it will be duly taken into consideration by the Supreme Court.\u201d German Chancellor Angela Merkel condemned the verdict as a \u201cterrible ruling\u201d; Frank-Walter Steinmeier, Germany's foreign minister, said that the EU would \u201ccontinue to exert pressure under the German presidency so that Libya doesn't only take part in a solution but ultimately brings about a solution\u201d. This toughened attitude contrasts sharply with that shown by the United States. President George Bush and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice expressed only \u201cdisappointment\u201d, and have avoided any discussion of a fair trial or the need for scientific evidence to be taken into account. The EU's direct language raises the stakes in the power play that surrounds the case. Until now, the international community's approach has mostly been one of 'silent diplomacy' \u2014 refraining from public criticism of Libya's handling of the case and relying on behind-the-scenes discussions. These interventions have centred on providing humanitarian aid, which might be seen as compensation (and thus a mitigating factor in Islamic law), while trying not to undercut the medical workers' defence with any implication of guilt and atonement. All the affected Libyan children are being treated in European hospitals. The death sentences mark the failure of this approach, says Emmanual Altit, the French human-rights lawyer who heads the international defence team. Altit has long criticized the politicization of the case, arguing that it acts against the interests of the six medical workers by making them a bargaining chip in Libya's relations with the West. Now that the political outcry has become noisier, it has been met with anger from Libya. Said Hafyana, the deputy secretary for external relations and international cooperation in Libya's General People's Committee, told Bulgaria's ambassador to Libya that: \u201cNo party, no country or authority has the right to intervene in the running of the Libyan justice system or to challenge its equity or fairness.\u201d Libyan state-controlled media have also orchestrated a campaign trying to equate the questioning of the guilt of the health workers with indifference to the plight of the children. Some allege that critics are part of a Western conspiracy. \u201cIs the blood of our children mere sewer water?\u201d asked the  El Jamahiriya  newspaper. When the six medical workers were arrested in 1999, the country's leader Colonel Gaddafi stoked up sentiments such as these by alleging that the infection was a plot by the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and Israel's intelligence agency the Mossad to destabilize the country. Since then, Libya's geopolitical position has changed. After it abandoned the pursuit of weapons of mass destruction in 2003, providing the West with intelligence on nuclear proliferation, the once-rogue state came to be seen as a partner in the 'war on terror'. When diplomatic ties with the United States and the EU were subsequently re-established and trade sanctions lifted, business from America and other nations flocked to the country, which has substantial untapped oil reserves. The United States is expected to appoint an ambassador to Libya in the coming months, and a visit by Rice seems likely. Sean McCormack, the official spokesman for the US Department of State, says that the verdict itself would not block such moves, and is only one of many considerations. The United States does not intend to take sides in the case, he adds. Libya's leadership now has greater incentive than ever to avoid diplomatic ructions; but there is substantial resistance to being seen as capitulating to pressure from the West. Gaddafi dug in his heels on 29 December by rejecting calls to release the medical team, and reasserting that intelligence agencies were behind the crime. According to diplomatic sources, the most optimistic outcome for the moment is that the six medical workers will remain condemned, but that a political solution will be found to have them freed. But the situation is increasingly volatile \u2014 and for the moment they remain in grave danger. \n                     Medics sentenced to death in Libya \n                   \n                     Molecular HIV evidence backs accused medics \n                   \n                     'A shocking lack of evidence' \n                   \n                     Forgotten plights \n                   \n                     Libya's travesty \n                   \n                     AIDS medics in focus \n                   \n                     EU relations with Libya \n                   \n                     Web resources on case \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

A few kilometres outside the West Bank city of Ramallah, not far from the rubble-strewn compound where Yasser Arafat lived for many years, lies the campus of Birzeit University. As elsewhere on the West Bank, Birzeit's students and staff have learnt to live with the disruption and casualties caused by the occupying Israeli military and armed Palestinian groups. But now the university says that it faces a non-violent but potentially more dangerous threat to its existence: an Israeli policy that is forcing academics to abandon their jobs. Around a year ago, say Palestinian academics, people with foreign passports started to find that their access to the West Bank and Gaza Strip was either denied or restricted by Israeli border controls. That poses a serious problem for universities. As there is no such thing as a Palestinian passport, researchers will, given the chance, often become naturalized citizens of other nations \u2014 forfeiting their right to Palestinian identification papers. Yet the new policy means that those academics, together with foreign staff, can find that a trip abroad ends in involuntary exile. At Birzeit, officials say that they cannot put an exact figure on the number denied re-entry, but say the policy is one reason that around half of the university's 57 foreign academics had to leave last year. Campaigners say that other universities in the regions have suffered the same consequences, although precise data are not available. \u201cWe don't know why they are doing this, but brain drain will be the end product,\u201d says Sarit Michaeli, communications director for B'Tselem, an Israeli human-rights group based in Jerusalem. The rationale for the move is hard to confirm, as the Israeli government initially said that it was simply enforcing existing rules. Many holders of foreign passports no longer have residence permits for the occupied territories and so have to repeatedly obtain three-month tourist visas to live there. Israeli officials said that the restrictions were designed to end this misuse of tourist visas. A request for clarification of this point received no reply. But in meetings with foreign diplomats last month, Israeli officials seemed to acknowledge the problem, saying that they would start to renew tourist visas and allow access to those whose passports have been stamped \u201clast entry\u201d. Palestinian campaigners say they have since seen written confirmation of this intent, but note that they have seen no sign of a change in policy at the borders and that some foreign-passport holders are still being refused entry. If the restrictions continue, academics from both sides of the border say they will fight them. A small group banded together last October to form the Israeli Committee for the Right of Residency, which is attempting to persuade Israel's academics to take a stand against the restrictions. Jacob Katriel, an emeritus physics professor at Technion, the Israeli Institute of Technology in Haifa, says the call was well received when he presented it last month during a session on human rights at the Statistical Mechanics Conference at Rutgers University, New Jersey. Palestinian universities are also asking foreign academics and scientific organizations to protest against the rules. They say that the loss of academic talent, together with a drop in fees earned from foreign students, could destabilize the fragile education and research infrastructure of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. \n                     Palestinian unease sparks fresh calls for Israeli boycott \n                   \n                     Across the great divide \n                   \n                     Paris university blasted over Israel motion \n                   \n                     Web focus: Israeli-Palestinian conflict \n                   \n                     Statement from the Israel Committee for the Right of Residency \n                   \n                     Campaign for the Right of Entry/Re-Entry to the Occupied Palestinian Territory \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Katharine Sanderson reports. When marvelling at the stars on a clear night, it's hard to imagine that there are up to 400 billion of them in our Galaxy alone. Even harder to comprehend is how many planets may be orbiting these stars \u2014 a number that could run into trillions. Surely somewhere among them there must be a comfortable home for alien life, even if it's not advanced enough to be gazing back at us? This is the question that exoplanet hunters are trying to answer. So far, they have spotted 209 planets beyond our Solar System. These tend to be gas giants in searingly hot orbits close to their parent stars \u2014 unlikely to be habitable. But researchers are edging closer to finding the one type of planet that we know can support life \u2014 a carbon copy of our own Earth. Thanks to improved techniques, mounting data and a new space mission, many believe that 2007 could be the year we find the first truly Earth-like planet. At the very least, we should have a much better idea of how common alien Earths may be. The main obstacle for planet hunters is that planets outside the Solar System are obscured by the light from their stars, so our telescopes can't see them directly. Most researchers make use of the fact that when a planet orbits a star, its gravitational pull causes the star to wobble slightly. As the star wobbles, its speed as seen from Earth (its radial velocity, or RV) changes, and this shows as a change in the wavelength of the star's light. This can be used to estimate a lower limit for the planet's mass. Unfortunately, RV tends to detect big planets that are close to their stars. Heavier planets cause more obvious wobbles. And close planets have shorter orbits, allowing researchers to observe several wobbles over a relatively short time. So far, the method has found 197 exoplanets, the smallest of which is at least 7.4 times the mass of Earth. But improvements in accuracy are allowing researchers to spot ever smaller planets, and as more observations are made, it's possible to detect planets that are farther from their stars. Geoffrey Marcy of the University of California, Berkeley, is responsible for an impressive 121 of the planets found using RV, and says his team is set to announce several exciting discoveries in 2007. He adds that he expects RV to reveal several rocky planets this year, and that within the next few years we may know whether Earth-like planets are common or rare in the Universe. \n               Transit tricks \n             Another limitation of RV is that, on its own, it doesn't reveal what a planet is made of. But coupling its mass with an estimate of the planet's radius \u2014 which can be worked out as it passes in front of (transits) its star \u2014 gives the density, which indicates whether a planet is a diffuse gas giant or a smaller rock. The main problem with this is that to see a transiting planet you need to look at the correct angle at the correct time, and with most exoplanets found we haven't been so lucky. Transits are most common for large planets close to their stars, which again skews our knowledge away from planets like Earth. In 2007, however, a European mission called COROT aims to improve the odds. Launched on 27 December, it will look specifically for transiting planets, which will then be followed up with RV measurements, either from Earth or from NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope. After a couple of months of calibration, COROT will make observations for 150 days, then turn 180\u00b0 and observe for another 150 days. To obtain reliable data, scientists need to watch three or four transits, so the craft's short observing period limits the search to planets close to their stars. This means COROT is unlikely to find a true Earth analogue. But it will tell us a lot about how common large, rocky planets are. \u201cIt's a necessary proof,\u201d says Malcolm Fridlund, project scientist on COROT. Fridlund is proud that Europe is leading the field rather than NASA. \u201cWe're taking the first step for once,\u201d he says. \u201cIf rocky planets are common enough, COROT could find planets that are habitable,\u201d says David Charbonneau, an astronomer at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The first results from COROT should be in and analysed by mid-2007, with ground-based follow-up experiments done by the end of the year. \u201cCOROT will find oodles of short-period planets, both hot Jupiters and hot super-Earths,\u201d says Alan Boss, a theoretician at the Carnegie Institution in Washington DC. But some see COROT simply as a stats-gathering prelude to NASA's more ambitious Kepler mission, which is due to launch late in 2008 and will make observations over four years. \u201cKepler holds even greater promise to detect rocky planets around Sun-like stars,\u201d says Marcy. For 2007, the best chance of spotting an Earth-like planet may come from another ground-based technique: gravitational microlensing. When two stars are closely aligned along our line of sight, the front star acts as a lens and magnifies light from the star behind, sometimes enough for an orbiting planet to be seen directly. Whereas RV is most sensitive to planets close to their stars, microlensing works best for distantly orbiting planets. Four planets have so far been detected in this way, including an icy 'super-Earth' (J.-P. Beaulieu  et al .  Nature   439 , 437\u2013440; 2006). A star undergoes a microlensing event as seen from Earth only once every 100,000 years, so spotting them is \u201cpretty hairy\u201d says Andrew Gould of Ohio State University in Columbus. Gould coordinates a team of astronomers around the globe (the MicroFUN group) who monitor changes in the brightness of around 50 million stars. They post a list of possible microlensing sites online, and Gould alerts astronomers in the appropriate locations where and when to look. The technique has bagged the lowest-mass planet so far, at 5.5 Earth masses. Gould predicts a one in ten chance of spotting an Earth-size planet in 2007 using microlensing, and reckons that in five years' time, he may be able to spot ten per year. If an alien Earth is found, the big question of whether it could support life will require information about its atmosphere. And researchers are set to make big progress here too this year. It's possible to scan a distant planet's atmosphere by taking the spectrum of the light emitted by its star when the planet is completely hidden from view, and subtracting it from the combined spectrum when the planet is in front. The technique was used to investigate the spectra of Pluto and Charon in the 1980s, and in 2001, Charbonneau and his team used the Hubble Space Telescope to detect sodium in the atmosphere of a Jupiter-class planet orbiting the star HD 209458. Last month, Jeremy Richardson of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, and his colleagues reported at the American Geophysical Union meeting in San Francisco that they have now used the Spitzer Space Telescope to make a more detailed study of the infrared spectrum of the same exoplanet. They measured the radiation emitted by the planet at various wavelengths, and are hopeful that they will be able to glean some information about the composition of its atmosphere. The team doesn't want to reveal details ahead of publication early this year. But co-author Sara Seager says that although these first spectral measurements are \u201cpretty crummy\u201d, the work is crucial proof that the technique will \u201cprovide the first-ever spectrum of an exoplanet. This is a big breakthrough in exoplanet science.\u201d This will be a big year for Spitzer, adds Charbonneau. He predicts that the telescope will study ten planets in detail in 2007, making temperature measurements and detecting gases such as methane and carbon monoxide. \n               For the future \n             Looking beyond 2007, \u201cKepler is the big one\u201d, says Charbonneau. Kepler's goal is to find an Earth-like planet. Like COROT, it will seek out transits, but will have more time to spot planets farther out from their stars. After that, prospects for the field are less rosy. NASA recently cut funding for its proposed Space Interferometry Mission (SIM), which is now seriously delayed. SIM would make very precise measurements of stars' wobbles in two planes, which would give an actual mass, rather than the lower limits provided by RV. The decision to cut funding has not gone down well, with Gould citing \u201cstupidity\u201d as one reason for the cut. Boss says the situation is \u201cdepressing\u201d and a backward step for exoplanetary research. He warns that even a slight dip in funding could cause well-trained scientists to leave the field. Two other projects, the European Space Agency's Darwin and NASA's Terrestrial Planet Finder, would take the first images of Earth-like planets. But these are also receiving too little funding to proceed. Should planet hunters be allocated scarce funds ahead of other projects? Scott Gaudi, who works with Gould, argues that the search for other worlds is a societal imperative: the question of whether other Earths exist is one that humans have always asked, he says. Despite the funding problems, he remains upbeat: \u201cThere is a very good chance that in our lifetime we will answer the age-old question: is there life out there?\u201d \n                     Planet hunt ready for lift-off \n                   \n                     News in brief \n                   \n                     Found: one Earth-like planet \n                   \n                     Rocky planet found outside Solar System \n                   \n                     Neptune-sized planets spied around distant stars \n                   \n                     Extrasolar planets \n                   \n                     CNES's COROT site \n                   \n                     ESA's COROT site \n                   \n                     The extrasolar planets encylopaedia \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Most of them can't be grown in the lab: \u201cWe just don't know what's in there.\u201d Proposals are requested for projects to sequence the microbial genes present in the body, which are thought to outnumber our own genes by a factor of 100. Another project earmarked for funding will support the global human variome project, which was launched in Melbourne, Australia, last June. The variome is the set of variations between different people's genomes, which influence the development of disease and drug side-effects. As yet there is no global system for collecting and sharing information on the human variome; FP7 promises to support one. FP7 also provides \u20ac7.5 billion for a new Europe-wide funding agency called the European Research Council (ERC), which launches this month. The council will fund smaller projects that do not meet the industrial or societal goals required by the rest of the framework programme. \n                     EU science fund targets young guns \n                   \n                     Microbiology: Gut reaction \n                   \n                     Science needs the commission, Sturm und Drang and all \n                   \n                     Cordis 7th Research Framework Programme \n                   \n                     Human Variome Project \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

A radical project from the Public Library of Science (PLoS), the most prominent publisher in the open-access movement, is setting out to challenge academia's obsession with journal status and impact factors. The online-only  PLoS One , which launched on 20 December, will publish any paper that is methodologically sound. Supporters say the approach will remove some of the inefficiencies associated with current peer-review systems \u2014 but critics question whether a journal that eschews impact factors will manage to attract papers. Among the 90 or so papers in  PLoS One  at its launch are reports on the meaning of wild gibbon songs and a mathematical model of rabies control. The authors of both papers say they chose  PLoS One  because they support open access, and because they wanted to be part of something new. \u201cI think we're seeing one of the future directions of scientific publishing,\u201d says Colin Russell, a zoologist at the University of Cambridge, UK, and an author of the rabies paper. Every paper submitted to the journal is reviewed by at least one member of  PLoS One 's editorial board of over 200 researchers, but only to check for serious flaws in the way the experiment was conducted and analysed. In contrast to almost all other journals, referees ignore the significance of the result. Notable papers will instead be highlighted by the attention they attract after publication. Visitors to the  PLoS One  website can, for example, attach comments to specific parts of a paper and rate the paper as a whole. Data from those systems, as well as download and citation statistics, will then allow  PLoS One 's editors to identify and promote the papers that researchers are talking about. \u201cWe're trying to make a journal where papers are not the end point, they are the start of a discussion,\u201d says  PLoS One  managing editor Chris Surridge, based in Cambridge, UK. The journal will initially publish 10\u201315 papers a week, but this could reach a few hundred each month, says Surridge. The system makes sense, he says, because a single review process avoids the time wasted when papers are rejected from high-ranking journals and reviewed again elsewhere. Others add that the journal's decision to accept papers from all areas of science could benefit authors of interdisciplinary studies, whose work is often rejected by subject-specific journals. But  PLoS One  faces some significant challenges. Many new journals struggle to attract papers until they are given an impact factor (a measure of the citations its papers receive), but a journal that accepts everything can't usefully be classified in this way. Critics also point out that referees may be reluctant to review potentially trivial papers, and that existing journals have had little luck persuading readers to comment on papers after publication. Yet Surridge is bullish about his journal's chances. He thinks referees will appreciate the approach, as it will cut the number of reviews that scientists as a whole have to make. He adds that existing attempts to encourage comments don't reflect the way scientists actually read papers \u2014 something he aims to remedy by allowing visitors to highlight and annotate different sections of text. Surridge also says that other systems offered little reward to researchers;  PLoS One  will allow comments to be rated by others, letting users establish status accordingly. Rival publishers have suggested that  PLoS One  is an attempt to prop up PLoS's finances (see  Nature   441 , 914; 2006). At present, PLoS relies on annual philanthropic donations of several million dollars to break even. The only similar open-access publishing venture \u2014 the online-only journals run by BioMed Central \u2014 is only now close to breaking even, six years after launch. But Surridge shrugs off the criticism, saying that  PLoS One  is designed to meet PLoS's aim of making scientific literature freely available. \n                     Funding agencies toughen stance on open access \n                   \n                     PS I want all the rights \n                   \n                     Congress pushes plan to make papers free \n                   \n                     Open-access journal hits rocky times \n                   \n                     UK research councils claim success for open-access publishing plan \n                   \n                     Open access debate web focus \n                   \n                     PLoS One \n                   \n                     BioMed Central \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Tension is building on both sides of the Atlantic in the race to find the Higgs boson, the elusive particle predicted by physicists' understanding of mass. Scientists working at the Tevatron particle collider at Fermilab in Batavia, Illinois, welcomed the new year by measuring the mass of another subatomic particle, the W boson. This finding lowers the expected mass of the Higgs, bringing it further into the range in which the Tevatron might be able to find it. Meanwhile, the Tevatron's more powerful competitor, the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), is entering its final stages of construction at CERN, the European particle-physics lab near Geneva in Switzerland. If the Higgs exists, the LHC should find it, but the spark of a chance that the Tevatron might get there first is energizing both teams. \u201cWe are pulling out all the stops,\u201d says Mark Lancaster, one of around 700 scientists working on the Collider Detector at Fermilab (CDF) \u2014 an instrument that collects and analyses debris from proton\u2013antiproton collisions in the Tevatron. Jim Virdee at CERN is the spokesman for one of the LHC's experiments, the Compact Muon Spectrometer. \u201cWe are aware of this competition,\u201d he says. \u201cIt makes us make sure the experiments and the accelerator are ready on time.\u201d The enormous parts of the spectrometer are currently being lowered delicately into place in the LHC's tunnels. The Higgs is thought to be a missing piece of the standard model of particle physics, which lumps together what is known about the fundamental forces and particles. Theories that extend the standard model without the Higgs tend to be more complex than those that include it \u2014 leaving physicists hopeful that it will turn up. Now that estimates of the Higgs' mass have shrunk, the odds have improved that the Tevatron will be able to detect it. In 2004, the upper bound of the boson's mass hovered around 250 gigaelectron volts (GeV), which was beyond the Tevatron's upper limit of about 170 GeV. But estimates of the Higgs' mass are based on the mass of other particles, such as the top quark and W boson, and updates in these measurements have since dragged the upper limit on the Higgs down. Most recently, on 8 January, the CDF measured the mass of the W boson more precisely than ever before, at 80.413 GeV. That figure is consistent with previous results, but towards the upper end of the range, and brings the upper limit for the Higgs down to 153 GeV from 166 GeV. The Large Electron\u2013Positron (LEP) collider, which CERN hosted until it was shut down in 2000, ruled out masses of up to 114.4 GeV \u2014 leaving just a small window still to explore (see Graphic). At the same time, the Tevatron has overcome some of the performance shortfalls that had dampened hopes of finding it at any mass. So researchers there, despite the threat of budget cuts forcing a temporary closure, are allowing themselves some optimism. \u201cWe have got about three years,\u201d says Lancaster. The Tevatron will run until 2009 and, although the LHC is due to switch on for a warm-up run in November, it will not start to collect data seriously until spring 2008. Ironically, the Tevatron's next Higgs announcement might be about not finding it. Just before LEP closed to make way for the LHC, it saw hints of a Higgs at around 115 GeV. The thought that the Higgs had narrowly escaped their grasp has haunted CERN's physicists ever since, but the Tevatron is on the verge of having enough data to rule out a particle of that mass. Unless something emerges in the next few months, the LEP ghost will be laid to rest. \u201cI would say that we would be able to rule out this hint from LEP before the LHC gets going in earnest,\u201d says Lancaster. \n                     Particle physics: From the top... \n                   \n                     Has the Higgs boson been discovered? \n                   \n                     Below-par performance hampers Fermilab quest for Higgs boson \n                   \n                     Physics@nature \n                   \n                     The Collider Detector at Fermilab \n                   \n                     The Large Hadron Collider at CERN \n                   \n                     Wikipedia on the Higgs boson \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Pfizer's Ann Arbor laboratory is the largest private-sector employer in the Michigan college town. It is also the birthplace of Lipitor, a cholesterol treatment whose annual sales of $13 billion make it the biggest-selling drug on the planet. So the lab's 2,100 staff were stunned when Pfizer announced on 22 January that it will close the lab by the end of next year. The closure is part of a move by the world's largest drug company to cut between $1.5 billion and $2 billion from its annual costs, eliminating some 10,000 positions, or about 10% of its workforce. That will include trimming its research and development staff from around 14,000 to 12,500, according to Pfizer's global research chief John LaMattina, and consolidating researchers at four key sites. The changes will make Pfizer's research operation more flexible and cost-effective, says LaMattina. \u201cThe simplification will add a lot to our efficiencies as well as the speed of our decision-making. But Michigan academics were left reeling by the announcement's local impact. \u201cIt takes decades to build something like that but, evidently, only 18 months to dismantle it,\u201d says Stephen Forrest, vice-president for research at the University of Michigan. Pfizer is facing shrinking profits, expiring patents and a pipeline that is looking short of obvious blockbuster drugs. Late last year, it was forced to withdraw torcetrapib \u2014 a cholesterol drug that had been touted as a successor to Lipitor \u2014 from clinical trials (see  Nature 445, 13; 2007 ). LaMattina claims the move is needed because the company has so many drug candidates at the expensive, late stages of development all at once, yet needs to control costs. \u201cWe're a little bit a victim of our own success,\u201d he says. Pfizer will stop some early-stage work, including efforts to find new skin and digestive-tract drugs, and will cut several layers of middle management. Afterwards, LaMattina adds, its laboratories will work at 95% of capacity instead of 65%. Research overhead costs will fall by one-fifth, he says, freeing up hundreds of millions of dollars from bricks and mortar to be spent on science. The four research sites after the reorganization will be at Groton, Connecticut; Sandwich, UK; St Louis, Missouri; and La Jolla, California. Consolidation into disease-specific groups at these sites will result in \u201cfewer frequent-flier miles and more time at the bench doing science\u201d, LaMattina says. The company is planning a new emphasis on bioetherapeutics at St Louis, on cardiovascular work at Groton, and on vaccines at Sandwich and La Jolla. But Alan Saltiel, director of the Life Sciences Institute at the University of Michigan and a former cell biologist at the Ann Arbor laboratory when it belonged to Warner-Lambert, before it was acquired by Pfizer in 2000, thinks the separation by disease area has a downside. \u201cWhat they lose are the opportunities and synergies across therapeutic areas,\u201d he points out. \u201cA lot of drug discovery is serendipity.\u201d As well as closing the Ann Arbor site and two smaller Michigan research groups, the company will shut its research facilities in Nagoya in Japan and Amboise in France. LaMattina says that the company is hoping to transfer, rather than dismiss, up to 70% of workers at targeted facilities. But Tony Butler, a pharmaceuticals analyst with Lehman Brothers in New York, doubts whether as many as that will move. And Peter Rost, a former vice-president of marketing and strident critic of Pfizer's current management \u2014 now in litigation with the company over the circumstances of his departure in 2005 \u2014 predicts that there is worse to come. \u201cThis is just the beginning,\u201d he says. \u201cIt is not the bottom. Two years from now, Pfizer will make another announcement, and cut another $2 billion.

Mention the name Laura Manuelidis to a prion researcher, and you will almost certainly get a strong reaction. For years the Yale University neuropathologist has ruffled feathers by arguing that a virus causes neurological conditions such as Creutzfeldt\u2013Jakob disease in humans and scrapie in animals, rather than an infectious protein, or 'prion', as most researchers believe. That argument is decades old, and the prion hypothesis has been steadily winning converts. But the publication of a paper from Manuelidis in the  Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences  last week served as a reminder that the debate is not over 1 . The paper, which shows pictures of virus-like particles in infected cells in culture, hardly overturns the prion hypothesis, but it does show how hard it can be to pin down the source of a disease. There was a time when the tables were reversed. Stanley Prusiner from the University of California, San Francisco, fought for years to win acceptance for his idea that a misshapen protein was the cause. When he got a Nobel prize in 1997, the fight for public opinion was won but scientific skirmishes continued. Researchers had shown that infecting animals with purified prions could cause disease, but some still questioned whether a virus particle or two could have slipped undetected through the purification process. But in 2004 Prusiner's lab showed that prions synthesized in a test tube \u2014 and so free of virus \u2014 could cause disease in mice 2 . A year later, Claudio Soto, a neurologist at the University of Texas in Galveston, selectively amplified prions from diseased mouse brains. He diluted his solutions until they could not contain any molecule from the brain sample other than prions. The solutions also infected mice 3 . That work silenced much of the debate, says Neil Cashman, scientific director of PrioNet Canada in Vancouver. \u201cI really feel that these viral people are swimming upstream,\u201d he says. \u201cBut some highly regarded people do not think the prion hypothesis has been proven.\u201d Prusiner's work was important but flawed, says Robert Rohwer, a neurovirologist at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Baltimore, Maryland. The amount of synthetic prion needed to infect the mice was a million times higher than would be required using brain isolates. And the mice were engineered to produce high amounts of the prion's natural form, making them prone to developing prion disease spontaneously. If the synthetic prion can be shown to infect normal mice, Rohwer says he will be convinced. \u201cIf it's successful and can be reproduced by others, then it really does close the issue as far as I'm concerned,\u201d he says. Prusiner's results have not yet been verified by other labs, and some researchers have complained that the transgenic mice he used were not made available. Ilia Baskakov, a lead author on Prusiner's paper who is now at the University of Maryland in Baltimore, says they used transgenic mice because these had the strongest response, but he hopes to replicate the work in wild-type animals soon. Baskakov says the synthetic prion probably had low activity because it was not folded into an optimally infectious form. \u201cThis is an extremely complex problem,\u201d he says. \u201cI would not expect that somebody would just generate 100% infectious prions in their first experiment.\u201d Meanwhile, Bruce Chesebro, chief of the Laboratory of Persistent Viral Diseases in Montana, is concerned that the infectivity of Soto's prion solutions didn't increase proportionally with their concentration. Soto says this was unique to the prion strain used for those experiments, and that subsequent, unpublished, work with other prions has shown that virulence does increase with concentration. For some researchers, these are mere details, and they clearly wish that Manuelidis and her arguments would just go away. Two refused to speak to  Nature , because they did not want to play any role in publicizing her work. Charles Weissmann of Scripps Florida in Jupiter says the evidence in favour of prions is incontrovertible. Although Manuelidis claims in her paper that virus-like particles from infected cells can infect other cells in culture, Weissmann says the findings are meaningless until she can purify her particles and show that they can cause disease and that they are free of the prion protein \u2014 something he does not expect to happen. Manuelidis believes that her criticism of prions has made it harder for her to publish in top journals. \u201cIt's not very politically correct if you don't believe in prions,\u201d she says. \u201cIt means that you won't get any grant money. Although many disagree with her, several prion researchers say that Manuelidis's scepticism keeps the field on its toes. \u201cTo me the prion issue is settled, but it's good to have this type of person,\u201d says Soto. \u201cThis issue is so important that you have to be very rigorous.\u201d \n                     Lab-made prions trigger mad cow symptoms \n                   \n                     Prion principle proved \n                   \n                     Distinguishing one prion from another \n                   \n                     Prions In Focus \n                   \n                     Neuroscience Podcast \n                   \n                     Neuroscience gateway \n                   \n                     Neuroscience blog \n                   \n                     Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \n                   \n                     Nobel prize 1997 \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

When archaeologists announced last week that they had uncovered a major settlement at the site of Stonehenge, you could be forgiven for asking why it hadn't been found before. The legendary circle of standing stones, located in densely populated southern England, is a popular tourist attraction and one of the most famous prehistoric monuments in the world. But on 30 January, archaeologists reported evidence that Stonehenge is just half of a bigger ceremonial complex. Excavations at a site called Durrington Walls, about three kilometres from Stonehenge, uncovered a cluster of houses and a vast stone avenue that connects the village to what would have been a circular arrangement of huge timber posts. \u201cThere is a kind of complementarity between the timber circle and the stone circle of Stonehenge,\u201d says Julian Thomas of the University of Manchester, and a director of the Stonehenge Riverside Project, which excavated the site last year. Stone avenues connect both circles to the nearby river Avon, but Stonehenge is oriented to face midsummer sunrise and midwinter sunset, whereas the wooden circle would have faced midwinter sunrise and midsummer sunset. Carbon dating suggests that the structures at Durrington Walls were built around the same time as Stonehenge, in 2600\u20132500  BC , supporting the idea that the villagers helped to build the stone monument. As well as being the \u201crichest site archaeologically speaking, it's also the filthiest we have ever seen\u201d, says project director Mike Parker Pearson of the University of Sheffield, UK. Some 50,000 animal bones found at the site suggest that people went there for \u201cfeast and fun\u201d. He speculates that the stone and wooden monuments played contrasting roles in cult practices \u2014 the wooden one being used to celebrate life, and the stone one to celebrate death. How did archaeologists miss all this material before? \u201cBecause it's a World Heritage Site, there has been a bit of a disincentive for people to go and excavate there,\u201d explains Timothy Darvill, an archaeologist at Bournemouth University, UK, who was not involved in the latest dig. \u201cIn the past, the thrust has been to conserve and protect such areas.\u201d But in recent years, attitudes have been shifting, says Darvill. \u201cPeople have realized that if you do nothing, you find nothing.\u201d That shift in philosophy seems to be paying dividends.

President George W. Bush's vision of America's science priorities, as revealed in his budget request for fiscal year 2008, is pretty much the same as it was last year. But one crucial thing has changed: the Democrats are now in charge of Congress, and they are the ones who get to decide whether his request becomes reality. When it received the president's request on 5 February, Congress was already in the process of ladling out an extra $620 million for biomedical research in the current year, enough for the president's 2008 request to actually represent a cut. Bush has focused instead on increasing funding for the physical sciences under the second year of a 'competitiveness initiative' to stimulate investment in science and engineering. Overshadowing all such requests is the war in Iraq and the global war on terror, for which Bush is requesting $142 billion for 2008. Meanwhile, US researchers continue to deal with the messy leftovers of last year's budget process, of which the biomedical science boost forms a part. The budget process ground to a halt in December when the old, Republican-led Congress left without finalizing budget bills for fiscal year 2007. Soon, though, the current Congress is expected to pass a sort of halfway budget for 2007, which would keep most agencies at their 2006 spending levels but make adjustments for some. The House of Representatives passed this bill on 31 January and the Senate is expected to do so by 15 February. This week, Bush asked Congress to give the National Institutes of Health (NIH) $28.7 billion in 2008 \u2014 $232 million of it new money compared with 2006 levels. But of that, $200 million would have to be transferred to the Global Fund to Fight HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. That means, in effect, that Bush's request would cut the agency budget by roughly half a billion dollars, or 1.7% in 2008. \n               see table \n               \n               Health check \n             Elias Zerhouni, the NIH director, said he was pleased with both the congressional action and Bush's budget request. \u201cI personally feel that there has been a huge turnaround \u2014 that Congress has regained confidence in the NIH,\u201d he said. \u201cThe same thing is true of this administration.\u201d Research advocates weren't so upbeat. David Moore, a lobbyist at the Association of American Medical Colleges, says that his group has been encouraged by Congress approving the extra money for 2007. \u201cWe're equally discouraged with the administration's budget,\u201d he adds, \u201cwhich essentially puts the NIH right back in the hole again.\u201d But Congress may boost the agency's budget further in 2008. The key congressional appropriators in both chambers of Congress are strong NIH advocates. And last month, Bush signed a law laying out broad directions for the NIH's future funding and administration (see  Nature 444, 796\u2013797; 2006 ). The law recommends that Congress fund the agency at $32.8 billion in 2008. That might be pie in the sky, but it's a pie that Congress might at least cast a glance at in the coming months. \n               Getting physical \n             Meanwhile, the push is on to dramatically boost funding in the physical sciences. The president's request for 2008 includes $4.4 billion for the Department of Energy's Office of Science, which funds such fields as high-energy and nuclear physics. That would be a 16% increase over the tentative 2007 funding levels currently under consideration in Congress. The request includes $51 million for construction of the Linac Coherent Light Source at Stanford University in California, and $160 million to begin the US contribution to the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER), the $6-billion international fusion project that is slated to begin construction in Cadarache, France. The competitiveness initiative would also provide a 21% jump in core research funding at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). That would bring NIST's total research budget to $501 million. The budget also calls for just under $94 million in funding for facilities that would go, in part, towards a new laboratory for atomic-scale electronics at the agency's campus in Boulder, Colorado. Overall, NIST's budget would drop 5% owing to the exclusion of several congressionally mandated projects, known as earmarks. The competitiveness initiative also showers cash on the National Science Foundation (NSF), which would receive $6.43 billion \u2014 an increase of more than 15% over its 2006 funding. The money goes to particular directorates within the NSF, including engineering; computer and information science and engineering; and mathematics and physical sciences. This division worries Joel Widder, a lobbyist with the firm Lewis-Burke Associates in Washington DC and a former NSF staffer. \u201cIt is clear that the administration is deciding which directorates are part of the competitiveness initiative,\u201d he says. \u201cI am concerned that this may become a more pronounced difference over time.\u201d He thinks the agency should have more control over how the money is divided up. The competitiveness initiative has some Democratic friends on Capitol Hill, including Bart Gordon (Democrat, Tennessee), who chairs the House Committee on Science and Technology. And a similar programme to boost funding for the agencies was unveiled in 2005 by Nancy Pelosi (Democrat, California), who is now Speaker of the House. But getting the substantial increases for the initiative through Congress may prove difficult. For 2007, congressional supporters were able to add only about half of what the president had requested for the initiative in its first year. That discrepancy may make it even harder to bolster the numbers further for 2008, says Michael Lubell, head of public affairs for the American Physical Society. \u201cClearly, it's a heavy lift,\u201d he says. \n               Space fight \n             Another agency that may see congressional wishes lined up against the president is NASA. Bush's request calls for $17.3 billion for the agency. That's a 6.5% increase over what NASA is likely to get if the 2007 spending bill passes the Senate, but the latest numbers don't offer much cause for optimism. The spending bill that passed the House last week includes a $26-million cut for the agency from its 2006 levels, at a time when NASA is struggling to complete its space shuttle and space station programmes. \u201cWhile the money being proposed for 2008 is back up to where it was planned to be, you can't make up for that year of inadequate funding,\u201d says John Logsdon, director of the Space Policy Institute at George Washington University in Washington DC. NASA administrator Michael Griffin this week admitted that plans to develop the Orion capsule and Ares I rocket to carry astronauts into orbit may take longer than expected. \u201cI am concerned about our ability to bring these new capabilities on-line by 2014,\u201d he said. Within its science priorities, though, NASA has reshuffled funds in order to launch the Global Precipitation Measurement Earth-observing satellite in 2013, which is earlier than had been expected. And a servicing mission to the Hubble Space Telescope is set to go ahead in September 2008. All the winners and losers in this year's budget race make Sam Rankin, director of the American Mathematical Society office in Washington DC, nervous. Take any agency or programme, he says, and \u201cyou do a chart of the differences from one year to the next and it looks like someone with bad teeth. In some ways, we are starting to pit sciences against one another, and I don't think that is helpful. We need something that is consistent and adequate.\u201d See Editorial,  \n                     page 568 \n                   . \n                     Power shift stymies US science budget \n                   \n                     US science meets new paymasters \n                   \n                     Alternative energy plan criticized \n                   \n                     Physics wins the US budget race \n                   \n                     President Bush's budget request for 2008 \n                   \n                     American Competitiveness Initiative \n                   \n                     National Institutes of Health \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Barend Mons's first objective would be ambitious enough for most people: to meld some of the most important biomedical databases into a single information resource. But that's just the beginning. Mons, a bioinformatician at the Erasmus Medical Centre in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, also wants to apply the Wikipedia philosophy. He's inviting the whole research community to help update a vast store of interlinked data. If he and his colleagues can pull it off \u2014 and even the project's advocates are not sure they can \u2014 they could transform the databases that are central to the work of many life scientists. A test version of the project, provisionally dubbed Wiki for Professionals ( http://www.wikiprofessional.info ), is due to launch in the next month. It already contains data from key sources, such as protein information from Swiss-Prot and gene descriptions from Gene Ontology. Over the past year, Mons's team has woven together these and other archives to create what, from a user's point of view, seems to be a single database. The page on the muscular-dystrophy protein dystrophin, for example, contains data from Swiss-Prot together with links to disease information from the US National Library of Medicine, as well as explanatory text. Links to relevant publications in PubMed are also available. Existing databases interlink to an extent, although the new resource is more comprehensive. But the next stage is the really radical bit. Biomedical research produces hundreds of thousands of papers a year, overwhelming database curators. To clear this bottleneck, Mons and his colleagues are allowing anyone to edit the entries, modifying and adding text and links as new work is published. That's an attractive proposition, say database administrators. Michael Ashburner, a geneticist at the University of Cambridge, UK, helps run FlyBase, a collection of gene data on the model organism  Drosophila melanogaster . The database receives around US$4 million a year from the US National Institutes of Health and employs up to five full-time curators, but still can't keep up with the relevant literature, says Ashburner, who is working with Mons on the new project. \u201cWe have a list of around 12 journals that we try to cover. Even that's tough.\u201d Anyone motivated to register can curate Wiki for Professionals. Visitors to the dystrophin entry, for example, can update almost any of the information on the page, such as statements about the role of the protein in disease. Users can also start new pages, and from later this year will be given the option of creating pages for themselves, with links to relevant publications. A final function, and the one that most excites Mons, is the availability of text-mining software. This will allow users to probe links between proteins, genes and disease that may be revealed only by comparing a large number of papers and other data. \u201cMons is a visionary,\u201d says Amos Bairoch at the Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics in Geneva, a collaborator on the project and the creator of Swiss-Prot. \u201cThis will be a revolution.\u201d Yet realizing the vision will be difficult. Top of the list of challenges is persuading the community to get involved. Adding one's own data is likely to be the biggest motivator \u2014 Bairoch and Ashburner say they get several calls a week asking for updates to databases, usually from researchers who want their own papers added. Whether this will be enough to keep the database fresh remains to be seen, given that employers and funders tend not to value updating information highly. Wiki for Professionals will also have to ensure that additions don't just reflect individual researchers' pet theories. Mons hopes scientists will adopt entries relevant to their work and use automated systems to alert them to changes, which they can then amend if necessary. The original data in Swiss-Prot and other databases will also be protected. The resource has been set up by Knewco, a scientific computing company based in Rockville, Maryland, and co-founded by Mons. The firm raised around $2 million in private funding to pay for the initial effort, and says basic access will be free. Revenue will be generated by charging drug firms and other users for premium services, such as the option to run a private version of the system incorporating proprietary data. \n                     The database revolution \n                   \n                     Genetic database to fight disease \n                   \n                     Powerful new database pins down emerging infections \n                   \n                     Databases in peril \n                   \n                     Alliance for cellular signaling: Into unknown territory \n                   \n                     Medical research news channel \n                   \n                     PSIB Swiss-Prot EBI \n                   \n                     PubMed \n                   \n                     FlyBase \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

An inquiry has exonerated nuclear engineer Rusi Taleyarkhan of misconduct with respect to allegations made internally at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana, officials announced last week. But the announcement may raise more questions than it answers: researchers in the field have criticized the university for failing to say whether the inquiry considered their concerns that the work may be fraudulent. Taleyarkhan claims to be able to produce fusion by collapsing bubbles in deuterated liquids. His work promised to improve prospects for developing a clean source of energy, but independent scientists have not been able to replicate the result. The work had been subject to several internal allegations of misconduct, including the fact that Taleyarkhan cited a paper by his student and postdoc as \u201cindependent\u201d confirmation of his findings 1 , 2 . Purdue announced on 7 February that \u201cthe committee determined that the evidence does not support the allegations of research misconduct and that no further investigation of the allegations is warranted\u201d. It has refused to specify the content of the allegations that it considered, except to say that they were \u201cinternal\u201d. Institutional proceedings involving Taleyarkhan began in March 2006, after concerns about his work were reported by  Nature 3 . Purdue's provost, Sally Mason, responded by saying that the university would undertake an objective review. In June 2006, the university said that the review was complete, but declined to make its findings public. Last week's announcement referred to the findings of a second internal inquiry subsequently appointed by Purdue's dean of engineering, Leah Jamieson. Taleyarkhan has told several news outlets that he feels \u201cvindicated\u201d. But critics have questioned the validity of Purdue's proceedings, and in particular, the apparent decision to limit its inquiry to internal allegations, yet possibly ignoring the concerns, including fraud, communicated by external researchers in the field. \u201cThey apparently narrowly focused the charge and avoided the question of whether the research was doctored,\u201d says Ken Suslick, a chemist at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign who has been attempting to replicate Taleyarkhan's claims. Suslick is one of several researchers worried that Taleyarkhan's work may be fraudulent, and he wrote to Purdue about his concerns in June 2006. These include the apparent duplication of data between reports of supposedly independent experiments 4  (first raised by  Nature ), and a report 5  that the spectrum of neutrons that Taleyarkhan claims to have detected from bubble fusion exactly matches that of a standard radioactive source called californium. Taleyarkhan has since replied that when he measures neutrons emitted by californium in his lab, he finds something quite unlike what he sees from his fusion experiments 6 . But a recent preprint points out that Taleyarkhan omitted some of the original spectral data in his reply, and that the full data set still looks like californium 7 . The university never responded to Suslick's concerns. Peter Dunn, Purdue's associate vice-president for research, told  Nature  that he believes the university followed its procedures. He declined to comment on why he never replied to Suslick, or on whether evidence related to Suslick's concerns was forwarded to either inquiry. Purdue hasn't revealed the identities of the members of the second inquiry panel, but Dale Compton, a professor of industrial engineering at Purdue and a member of the first panel, says he has no recollection of being asked to consider the questions about Taleyarkhan's data. Lefteri Tsoukalas, who asked Purdue to investigate Taleyarkhan in February 2006, has called the announcement \u201can outrage\u201d. Tsoukalas was head of Purdue's nuclear-engineering school until he resigned in October 2006 in protest at the way the university was handling the concerns. He notes that the usual procedure for handling allegations of scientific misconduct is to hold a preliminary inquiry, then either proceed with an investigation or close the matter. That did not happen in this case; instead, the university ran a second preliminary inquiry. Apart from Tsoukalas, calls by  Nature  have failed to locate anyone who raised concerns about Taleyarkhan's work who was interviewed during either inquiry. \u201cPurdue's finding is as mysterious as bubble fusion itself,\u201d says Tsoukalas. Taleyarkhan, however, strongly defends the university's process. \u201cPurdue University in my opinion and experience has conducted an extremely thorough review and with my full cooperation,\u201d he told  Nature . \u201cAllegations made in the press have been known to Purdue, and the administration's thoughtful conclusions have been well-articulated in their statements.\u201d Beyond the issue of misconduct, Purdue also makes clear that it endorses the scientific value of Taleyarkhan's work. In last week's press release, vice-president for university relations Joe Bennett stated: \u201cProfessor Taleyarkhan is engaged in very promising, significant research, and we hope he will now be able to give his full attention to this important work.\u201d Seth Putterman of the University of California, Los Angeles, who has also been trying to replicate bubble fusion, thinks that Taleyarkhan's work is invalid. \u201cPurdue's defence of Taleyarkhan's approach to scientific research taints their reputation,\u201d he says. \u201cIf Purdue were interested in maintaining their credibility they should have appointed external members to their panel.\u201d Mason, who is ultimately responsible for academic affairs at Purdue, did not respond to  Nature 's requests for comment. Purdue's announcement appeared on the same day as Suslick, Putterman and others reported their attempt to replicate Taleyarkhan's claims in an experiment built to his specifications 8 . They did not find any evidence that fusion was occurring. Suslick, Putterman and Taleyarkhan had received funding from the US Department of Defense's Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) for a project to test Taleyarkhan's original claims. Taleyarkhan has spent around US$200,000 of this money on his bubble-fusion experiments. A spokeswoman for DARPA, Jan Walker, told  Nature  that although Purdue has not formally notified the agency of the inquiry or its results: \u201cWe are aware that an inquiry has taken place and are currently reviewing what, if any, action is required on our part.\u201d \n                     Purdue attacked over fusion inquiry \n                   \n                     Concerns grow over secrecy of bubble-fusion inquiry \n                   \n                     Bubble fusion: silencing the hype \n                   \n                     Desktop fusion is back on the table \n                   \n                     Physical sciences news channel \n                   \n                     Purdue University College of Science Department of Physics \n                   \n                     UCLA Department of Physics and Astronomy \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Scientists and activists struggling to combat the HIV epidemic were shattered by last month's failure of a candidate microbicide gel in large clinical trials. Microbicides aim to block HIV infection, but the candidate product \u2014 cellulose sulphate \u2014 seemed to increase women's susceptibility. In the wake of this setback, some are now warning that the field must change its approach. Dozens of candidate microbicides are being tested in labs around the world. But advocates of change say the field must make hard choices about which of these should graduate to phase III clinical trials \u2014 extended trials to confirm that a product works \u2014 because these trials are expensive and time-consuming. Such choices have not previously been made: the gels tested so far were the first to be ready, not necessarily the most promising. \u201cHow many more clinical trials are we going to be able to do with dramatic failures like this?\u201d asks Ronald Veazey, chair of the division of comparative pathology at the Tulane National Primate Research Center in Covington, Louisiana. The microbicides tested in phase III trials so far all belong to a 'first generation' of products that aim to make the vagina less hospitable to HIV, but don't target the virus directly. So far, none of these has worked. One, Savvy gel, failed, and two \u2014 cellulose sulphate and the spermicide nonoxynol-9 \u2014 led to higher HIV infection rates. Phase III trials of three other products are ongoing, a redundancy that is now unavoidable as the trials have already begun. Meanwhile, most researchers see more promise in a batch of microbicides at an earlier stage of development. These products contain gel formulations of antiretroviral drugs that target HIV. But for these microbicides, too, there are many similar products in the pipeline. For instance, different groups are testing at least four microbicide candidates belonging to a class of drug known as non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs). Two of these will probably be ready for phase III trials before 2009. The question now is whether all the products should automatically be pushed into such trials. \u201cAre we really going to proceed with two different NNRTIs, or should we be doing a study comparing them head-to-head, to help us determine which move forward?\u201d says Salim Abdool Karim, director of an AIDS research centre at the University of KwaZulu-Natal in Durban, South Africa. Right now, it is difficult to choose the best candidates without doing large human studies because different research groups use different preclinical testing methods, and there is no agreement on which of these tests best predict how a microbicide will act in patients. The failure of cellulose sulphate may actually help solve this problem. CONRAD, the Virginia-based agency that organized trials of cellulose sulphate in five countries, is determined to find out why the compound was harmful. \u201cWe'll probably put together a blinded panel of compounds, including cellulose sulphate, and send it out to various individuals working on different models and see if they can come up with any clues,\u201d says Henry Gabelnick, CONRAD's executive director. Testing the same products across different models could help researchers compare different microbicides in future. But that will leave a bigger obstacle: each research group is investing in its own product, so will be reluctant to step aside for others. The field may need a guiding hand from an impartial body, which doesn't exist at the moment. It has been suggested that a working group on microbicides currently being set up by the US National Institutes of Health's Office of AIDS Research may serve this role. Its composition and role have not been clearly defined, but advocates suggest it could solicit advice from independent experts about which products should proceed to clinical trials. Some, including Gabelnick, say it would be a mistake to jettison products just to avoid redundancy. \u201cWe don't know enough to say these are all the same,\u201d he argues. But others, such as Polly Harrison, director of the Alliance for Microbicide Development based in Silver Spring, Maryland, say someone has to help the field reach a consensus. \u201cPrioritization has to occur, and it has to go all the way along the pipeline,\u201d Harrison says. \u201cWe know we need this.\u201d See Editorial ,  page 1 . \n                     Treat herpes, treat HIV? \n                   \n                     AIDS meeting urged to rethink prevention strategy \n                   \n                     Drug firms donate compounds for anti-HIV gel \n                   \n                     Starting to gel \n                   \n                     Blog: 2006 International AIDS Conference \n                   \n                     2004 AIDS Conference Special \n                   \n                     Information on cellulose sulphate trials \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

He's a young astronomer with dozens of articles in top journals; he has made an important discovery in the field of extrasolar planets; and he is a proponent of intelligent design, the idea that an intelligent force has shaped the Universe. It's that last fact that Guillermo Gonzalez thinks has cost him his tenure at Iowa State University. Gonzalez, who has been at Iowa State in Ames since 2001, was denied tenure on 9 March. He is now appealing the decision on the grounds that his religious belief, not the quality of his science, was the basis for turning down his application. \u201cI'm concerned my views on intelligent design were a factor,\u201d he says. Advocates of intelligent design are rallying behind Gonzalez in the latest example of what they say is blatant academic discrimination. \u201cAcademia seems to be in a rage about anything that points to any purpose,\u201d says Michael Behe, a biochemist and prominent advocate of intelligent design at Lehigh University in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. \u201cThey are penalizing an associate professor who's doing his job because he has views they disagree with.\u201d But other researchers think that the department's decision was entirely justified. \u201cI would have voted to deny him tenure,\u201d says Robert Park, a physicist at the University of Maryland in College Park. \u201cHe has established that he does not understand the scientific process.\u201d Gonzalez's early career was far from controversial. He graduated with a PhD from the University of Washington, Seattle, in 1993 and did a postdoc at the University of Texas in Austin. \u201cHe proved himself very quickly,\u201d says David Lambert, director of the university's MacDonald Observatory. He and Gonzalez co-authored several papers on variable stars, and Lambert says that while there, the young Cuban immigrant was an impressive scientist. \u201cHe is one of the best postdocs I have had,\u201d he says. In 1996, Gonzalez returned to the University of Washington to do his second postdoc, and again distinguished himself \u2014 producing two papers 1 , 2  that linked a star's metal content to the presence of extrasolar planets around it. The papers are still highly cited, and they have encouraged other researchers to search for planets around metal-rich stars. The 43-year-old astronomer is also a deeply religious evangelical Christian, and his faith has shaped his views on science. He considers himself a \u201csceptic\u201d of Darwin, and says that his Christianity helps him to understand Earth's position in the Universe. \u201cOur location in the Galaxy, which is optimized for habitability, is also the best place for doing cosmology and stellar astrophysics in the Galaxy,\u201d he says. In other words: \u201cThe Universe is designed for scientific discovery.\u201d Gonzalez refrained from mentioning his beliefs in his teaching and peer-reviewed works, but in 2004, he co-authored a book entitled  The Privileged Planet , which included many of his pro-design arguments 3 . He has since travelled the country delivering talks that support the thesis of his book. His work did not go unnoticed at Iowa State. In 2005, Gonzalez's rising profile led a group of 131 faculty members to sign a petition disavowing intelligent design. \u201cWe were starting to see Iowa State mentioned as a place where intelligent-design research was happening,\u201d says Hector Avalos, a religious-studies professor who helped lead the signature drive. \u201cWe wanted to make sure that people knew the university does not support intelligent design.\u201d Avalos adds that they did not name Gonzalez directly, and he takes no position on the astronomer's tenure. Nevertheless, proponents of intelligent design point to the signature drive as evidence of a widespread academic hostility to those who support the idea. \u201cThere is a pattern happening to everybody who's pro intelligent design,\u201d says one pro-design biologist, who declined to be named because his own tenure process has just begun. \u201cThe same thing could happen to me,\u201d he says. \u201cI don't want to get into trouble.\u201d But Park says that a researcher's views on intelligent design cannot be divorced from the tenure decision. Anyone who believes that an intelligent force set the Earth's location doesn't understand probability's role in the Universe, Park argues. Such a person is hardly qualified to teach others about the scientific method. \u201cWe're entrusting the minds of our students to this person,\u201d he says. But not all scientists agree. \u201cNothing I have seen in his refereed papers leads me to believe his beliefs are impinging on his science,\u201d says David Lambert. \u201cI would have said he was a serious tenure candidate.\u201d Eli Rosenberg, who chairs Iowa State's physics department, concedes that Gonzalez's belief in intelligent design did come up during the tenure process. \u201cI'd be a fool if I said it was not [discussed],\u201d he says. But, he adds, \u201cintelligent design was not a major or even a big factor in this decision.\u201d Four of twelve tenure candidates have been turned down in the past decade, he says. \u201cWe are a fairly hard-nosed department.\u201d Iowa State's president Gregory Geoffroy is now reviewing Gonzalez's appeal. He has until 6 June to make his final decision. \n                     Day of judgement for intelligent design \n                   \n                     Evolutionist row makes museum ditch donation \n                   \n                     Scientists attack Bush over intelligent design \n                   \n                     Intelligent design: Who has designs on your students' minds? \n                   \n                     Religion and Science \n                   \n                     Iowa State University \n                   \n                     Guillermo Gonzalez's homepage \n                   \n                     The Iowa State Petition \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Is the average US citizen ready to pay $30 to find out whether climate change will put their home at risk of being drowned by sea water, or burned in a wildfire? David Purcell, a former banking executive, is betting that the answer is 'yes'. He has teamed up with climate scientists at the University of Arizona in Tucson and set up a website, called Climate Appraisal, that generates maps, graphs and commentary on environmental risks \u2014 including those related to climate change \u2014 for any location in the United States. But some question whether, at this stage in the science, meaningful predictions on such a small scale can be made. \u201cEver since we knew about global warming, there's been a demand for bringing it down to a level that local people care about,\u201d says Gavin Schmidt, a climate modeller at NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York, who hasn't seen Climate Appraisal's reports. \u201cBut there are some irreducible difficulties in doing so.\u201d Purcell, who is based in Easton, Connecticut, says the website is a way to bring climate science to the public, and adds that his long-term goal is to direct at least 50% of the income it generates to climate research and education. He's built the site with the help of Jonathan Overpeck, a climate scientist at the University of Arizona and a lead author of the latest reports on climate change presented earlier this year by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). \u201cI saw that this could get people to take climate change seriously because they would see their stake in it,\u201d Overpeck says. So far the undisclosed investment in Climate Appraisal has come from Purcell's pocket. Overpeck and two other Earth scientists at the University of Arizona have written articles for the site and advised on what data to present and how to present them for free. But Climate Appraisal has to strike a difficult balance in giving homeowners detailed information while not overstating the scientific certainty. As the effects of global warming begin to be noticed, climate scientists have come under growing pressure to forecast what will happen on local scales of as little as a few kilometres. But most are wary of making statements about such impacts. It was only in its latest round of reports that the IPCC sought to do so \u2014 and it confined itself to producing forecasts for regions 500 kilometres across. To evaluate Climate Appraisal's approach,  Nature  asked six climate scientists to comment on five of the website's reports for a range of US locations. Most said that the site's biggest plus was the way it collates so many types of information. Providing historical data on extreme events such as floods, wildfires, hurricanes and tornadoes, plus lists of toxic-waste sites, data on air quality, and information about certain diseases, is helpful to people who want a broad idea of an area's hazards, they say. But the information that the site presents on climate change is limited, our reviewers said, in large part because Overpeck and his colleagues have been careful not to go beyond what the science tells them. Climate Appraisal's main address-specific data on climate change are projected temperatures for 2050 and 2100 and, for coastal addresses, sea-level changes for the coming century and beyond. For example, users can zoom in on an area just a few kilometres across to see whether it is likely to be submerged if the sea rose by about a metre. Philip Mote, one of the reviewers and a climatologist at the University of Washington in Seattle, says he would like to see more explanation and caveats given for both sea-level and temperature projections. In the case of sea-level rise, he says, although a metre rise is plausible within the next 100 years, complicating factors such as movement of Earth's continental plates make it difficult to predict how different shorelines will be affected. \u201cIf I was doing this I would caveat it to death,\u201d says another reviewer, Linda Mearns, a climate scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colorado, and another lead author on the IPCC reports. Overpeck recognizes that there are some gaps and glitches in the data, and is hoping that sales of the reports will allow him and his colleagues to replace some outmoded information with the latest IPCC forecasts and better models. For now, limited money and time mean using only the data that are \u201cpublished, public and affordable\u201d. He says that the site's advice for users is as comprehensive as it needs to be, without being confusing. \u201cIf we included all the scientific discussion about all the uncertainties, no one would ever read it.\u201d Purcell believes the site will give the public the kind of information that insurance companies are using to decide whether to cover certain risks. That's a live issue for many US homeowners: only last week, insurance company Allstate stopped offering policies to new homeowners in California because of the growing risk of wildfires there. With decades of experience in risk assessment, insurance companies and the consulting firms that they use remain best-placed to evaluate a place's environmental hazards, says Celine Herweijer, principal climate scientist for Risk Management Solutions in London. She adds that although the idea of giving the public risk information is a good one, the information Climate Appraisal is currently selling will be of limited use to the homeowner. In the case of floods, for example, homeowners would benefit most from estimates of the probability of a flood of a certain depth, Herweijer says, rather than from a national map of flood events, or a list of past floods in their area. By linking climate change to someone's home address, Climate Appraisal is entering new and fairly treacherous waters. All in all, however, Herweijer and other climate scientists say the idea of making local risk information more widely available is valuable. In attempting to work out what to present and how to present it, most agree that the venture should be admired for its ambition. \u201cYou have to applaud it for what it is trying to do,\u201d says Schmidt. \n                     Climate Change 2007: How to survive a warming world \n                   \n                     Insurers' disaster files suggest climate is culprit \n                   \n                     Meteorology: Bad weather ahead \n                   \n                     Warming seas cause stronger hurricanes \n                   \n                     Natural disasters: The chaos to come \n                   \n                     Climate Appraisal \n                   \n                     Risk Management Solutions \n                   \n                     Climate Choices \n                   \n                     Stardex \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Genome researchers are questioning the plans of some of their number to stage high-profile releases of their very own genome sequences. Tension over the issue surfaced this month at the annual genomics meeting at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in New York. There, some researchers expressed concerns that sequencing prominent scientists first will make personal genomics look like a tool for the rich and privileged. At the meeting, Michael Egholm, a vice-president at 454 Life Sciences, a sequencing technology company in Branford, Connecticut, stood by a poster describing his company's effort to sequence the genome of genetics pioneer James Watson. The company claims this is the first sequence of an individual human genome, and that it took three months and cost about $1 million. \u201cSo, is this the next space tourism?\u201d joked a scientist inspecting the poster. Egholm winced at the implication that his company's plan is a vanity project for the wealthy. \u201cWhat really matters is the  next  100 genomes,\u201d he responded, carefully. The exchange reflects tension between geneticists over whether sequencing scientists and celebrities is the best way to begin the long-promised era of personalized medicine. Watson and a handful of other famous people will be the first to see their complete genome sequences \u2014 and some scientists are uncomfortable with that. \u201cIf all the sequences obtained over the next year or two are done on scientists with strong financial positions, that will send a message quite contrary to what the genome project aimed to achieve,\u201d says Francis Collins, head of the US National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) in Bethesda, Maryland. The sequencing of individual human genomes has long been a central goal of genomics. In 2001, the Human Genome Project produced a reference genome from the DNA of many different individuals. As with that project, attempts to sequence individual genomes are culminating in a race to finish first. On 31 May, 454 is expected to join scientists at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, Texas, to present Watson with a copy of his genome. But genomics pioneer Craig Venter claims he has already sequenced and assembled his own genome and submitted it to the publicly funded database GenBank. He says an analysis of his genome will be described in an upcoming paper in the journal  PLoS Biology . Next up will probably be sequencing guru George Church of Harvard University, who is one of the first ten volunteers for his privately funded Personal Genome Project. Then there is the Archon X Prize in Genomics \u2014 a $10-million cash award for the first team to sequence 100 genomes in 10 days \u2014 for which Venter is co-chair of the scientific advisory board. The prizewinner can claim a $1-million bonus by sequencing a list of 100 individuals, including people nominated by disease advocacy groups, and celebrities such as television journalist Larry King, cosmologist Stephen Hawking, Google co-founder Larry Page, Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen and former junk-bond trader Michael Milken. The scramble has some researchers wondering whether the public will see personal genomics as an activity for the benefit of humanity. \u201cI'd hate the availability of single-genome sequencing to be based purely on money and fame,\u201d says Michael Ashburner, a geneticist at the University of Cambridge, UK. \u201cJust doing famous or very rich people is bloody tacky, actually.\u201d \u201cThis is almost like recreational genomics, or the molecular equivalent of a whole-body scan, for those who have boundless curiosity and cash,\u201d says Kathy Hudson, director of Johns Hopkins University's Genetics and Public Policy Centre in Washington DC. \u201cIt will be sort of a sad statement if that's what we end up getting out of the Human Genome Project.\u201d Scientists such as Venter counter that sequencing themselves first will defuse public anxiety about the possible misuse of genomic data by insurers, employers and others. The institutional review board that approved Church's project, for instance, said that only people with a master's degree in genetics, or the equivalent, should be allowed to volunteer, to ensure that they understand the implications. Venter says he is creating a database where sequenced individuals can put genetic and personal information, such as medical records. He says he will deposit his own clinical information, possibly when his book  A Life Decoded: My Genome, My Life  is published in October. \u201cI think it would be wrong to take ten 'average' people and try to convince them it's all right for them to have their genetic code and life histories exposed on the Internet if people in a leadership position are not willing to do that,\u201d Venter says. But it's not clear that all of the genome pioneers are acting altruistically. Watson said at the Cold Spring Harbor meeting on 10 May that he has not asked either of his grown sons for permission to publish his genome sequence, which 454 has said will be publicly posted in some form. That has raised questions about the responsibility of sequenced individuals to family members who share their DNA. \u201cThis will be a challenging question, because if you're planning to put this information in a truly open database, there are issues of risk not just to you, but to your relatives,\u201d Collins says. \u201cJim clearly felt those risks were not such as to cause him to take action on them.\u201d Watson knows that he and other individuals will not learn much of use from their own genomes \u2014 at least, not yet. Scientists are still learning to interpret genomic data, and have yet to unravel the genetic signatures of most diseases. There are some exceptions \u2014 Watson has asked 454 not to reveal the status of his gene for apolipoprotein E, because it is associated with Alzheimer's disease. But for the most part, personal genomes will not become useful until hundreds or thousands of individual genomes have been analysed. The NHGRI is now planning to sequence about 100 individual genomes at its three publicly funded sequencing centres over the next couple of years. Collins says the institute will ask for scientific advice on who should be sequenced first. One question is what pool of sequenced individuals will yield the most useful information. For instance, it might be possible to discover the basis of a rare genetic disease by sequencing many families affected by it. Scientists could also learn much from cancer patients or people who have already been studied in the International HapMap Project, a publicly funded effort to look at human genetic variation. \u201cWe would want these to be chosen in such a way that you could get maximum information out of them, and there are various opinions about what that would mean,\u201d Collins says. \n                     Kudos, not cash, is the real X-factor \n                   \n                     Genome sequencing X Prize announced \n                   \n                     Sequencers step up to the speed challenge \n                   \n                     Fast sequencing comes to light \n                   \n                     NPG Omics gateway \n                   \n                     The X Prize \n                   \n                     NHGRI \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Isolation is a major factor weakening Japanese science, says neuroscientist Takao Hensch, who last year moved to Harvard University after ten years at the RIKEN Brain Science Institute in Wako, north of Tokyo. \u201cTo be competitive there must be constant communication ensuring that Japanese scientists are respected participants in their fields,\u201d Hensch says. Japanese policy-makers, including officials at the science ministry, accept that the country's science is isolated as a result of its culture, geography and language. They also suspect that Japanese science is underperforming as a result. The new institutes, which will be selected in September by an international review panel, are expected to serve as 'globally visible' research centres and to attract top-level researchers from around the world. To prevent the centres from merely paying lip-service to these goals, the application stipulates that 30% of the roughly 200 researchers expected at each centre and 10\u201320% of the 10\u201320 principal investigators must be foreigners. Lack of progress towards these goals could lead to closure. Such attempts to make Japanese research more international are not new. The Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology, for example, which officially opened this year, had said that it would hire half of its research staff from abroad and looks set to meet that target. At the RIKEN Center for Developmental Biology (CDB) in Kobe, which opened in 2002, 10% of the staff and principal investigators are foreigners. And 20% of the staff at the RIKEN Brain Science Institute, which was set up in 1997, are also from overseas. But these institutes have remained exceptions in a conservative Japanese system that is generally not regarded as being welcoming to non-Japanese scientists. Some of the problems lie outside the institutes themselves. Douglas Sipp, who heads the CDB's international-relations office, says that although all research material is available bilingually, the ministries tend to send documents such as grant-programme notices in Japanese, with English versions sometimes arriving too late to be of use. Sipp also says that the difficulty foreign researchers have in paying for international schools for their children or finding posts for their spouses makes recruitment hard. Hensch says the situation in the universities remains a major stumbling-block. \u201cAlthough it is fine to provide great resources, autonomy and accountability for talented young researchers, without similar openings in the traditional hierarchical university system there can be no culture of mobility and turnover.\u201d Tasuku Honjo, an immunologist at Kyoto University, agrees that the universities must change. Honjo is a member of the country's highest scientific decision-making body, the Council for Science and Technology Policy, which introduced the latest initiative. Reform of the universities in 2004 (see  Nature   419 , 875\u2013876; 2002) was meant to give them the freedom to compete both with each other and internationally for top talent. \u201cIn actuality, nothing has changed,\u201d Honjo says. The problem, Honjo adds, is that Japanese institutions continue to place fairness above excellence. \u201cThe important thing is being equal,\u201d he says. \u201cIt's hard to change these things with compulsory rules.\u201d But the new centres are intended to become models for how freedom should be exercised. Officials hope the centres will play a major role in boosting Japan's scientific productivity. Figures released by Thomson Scientific on 15 May ranked Japan second in the world for the number of scientific publications between 1996 and 2006. But Germany, which over that period invested half the funds in science compared with Japan, had only 6% fewer papers. And for the number of high-impact papers, Japan ranked only fifth. The interpretation of such data is, of course, open to debate. Some observers point out, for example, that Japan's research investment may be bearing more fruit through its highly successful and innovative industrial corporations than through its number of publications. \n                     Japan's university shake-up wins faint praise after first year \n                   \n                     Winds of change blow away the cobwebs on campus \n                   \n                     Japanese universities: Independence days \n                   \n                     Japan plans web of English journals \n                   \n                     Winning universities set out to fulfil Japan's plans for excellence \n                   \n                     World Premier International Research Center \n                   \n                     World Premier International Research Center \n                   \n                     RIKEN Brain Science Institute \n                   \n                     RIKEN Center for Developmental Biology \n                   \n                     Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology \n                   Reprints and Permissions"}
