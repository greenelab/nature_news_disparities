It commemorated the 500th anniversary of the death of the Zen Buddhist monk and painter Sesshu Toyo, whose delicate  suibokuga  ink paintings have been designated 'National Treasures' by the Japanese government. So that visitors could appreciate Sesshu's scrolls as closely as possible to the way original admirers did \u2014 under candlelight or torchlight \u2014 some of the paintings were illuminated by a specially designed light-emitting diode (LED) system. Tsunemasa Taguchi and Michitaka Kono now provide the technical details of that system (T. Taguchi and M. Kono  J. Light Visual Environ.   31,  149\u2013151; 2007). LEDs are solid-state light emitters known for their energy efficiency, flexibility of design and robustness. For a long time, they were made to emit light only in a particular part of the visible-wavelength spectrum. But in the mid-1990s a new generation emerged, based on blue LEDs covered with a yellow phosphorescent layer, which emitted bright, white light. Taguchi and Kono's lighting system used special LEDs that contained three different phosphors, each emitting at different frequencies. This meant that the white light emitted had a particularly high colour quality, as quantified on a scale known as the colour-rendering index. To optimize viewers' appreciation, the authors tailored the LEDs to render the earthy red colours characteristic of the antique scrolls especially well. The individual lights were positioned so as to distribute light evenly on the artwork (first two paintings pictured), rather than scattering it around them as fluorescent lamps would do (paintings in background). The output of the LEDs was stable and did not cause heating, thus assisting preservation of the precious scripts. White LEDs are becoming ever brighter, more efficient and less expensive. As a result, traditional light bulbs are increasingly on the way out. Large-scale applications, such as car lights, traffic signals and Christmas decorations, are where the economic benefits of LED use are being felt. But the illumination of antique Japanese art must surely rank as one of the diodes' most aesthetically pleasing applications. Reprints and Permissions"},

Now Brian Haley and colleagues report in  Nature Geoscience  that the ridge furnishes evidence of Russia's past influence on the region \u2014 at least, on its ocean circulation (B. A. Haley  et al .  Nature Geosci.  doi:10.1038/ngeo.2007.5; 2007 ). They study neodymium (Nd) isotopic ratios in marine sediments in a core of sediments drilled from the Lomonosov ridge near the North Pole, at a sea depth of 1,250 metres.  The core represents a historical sketch of Arctic oceanography over the past 65 million years. The authors' big news is that the ratio  143 Nd/ 144 Nd of deep Arctic water that is preserved in the sediments was consistently far higher in the Neogene period between 15 million and 2 million years ago than it is now, indicating the influence of young, mantle-derived rock. In the past 2 million years, similarly high ratios are found only during short ice ages. Haley  et al . argue that the only credible source for such a signal is material from the Putorana basalts of the Central Siberian Plateau. But how did a surface-water signal from the Siberian coastal shelf sink to the great depths of the Lomonosov ridge? The authors see the answer in the wider global climate, and the opening up of the Fram Strait 17.5 million years ago. This strait is the only deep passage for water to and from the Arctic, and runs roughly along the Greenwich meridian between Greenland and the Norwegian island of Spitsbergen. Its breaching allowed warm, saline waters to flow into the Arctic from the Atlantic. As these waters entered colder climes, evaporation increased, causing more precipitation and the growth of extensive floating ice shelves at northerly latitudes \u2014 including along the Siberian coast. As sea water freezes, it rejects salt. Haley  et al . propose that the resulting denser, briny water that sank beneath the developing ice sheet carried Russian sediment to the Lomosonov ridge during the Neogene, as it similarly does off Antarctica today. Waters from the North Atlantic drift have low neodymium ratios. The authors estimate that, to maintain the ratios of the Neogene core record after the initial influx following the Fram breach, the flow of warm water from the Atlantic into the Arctic could have been no more than half of that today. They suggest that the Atlantic conveyor belt must at that time have stopped at a more southerly point than it does today. This is a well-established prediction for recent ice ages, which indeed also produce high neodymium ratios in the Arctic cores. But how it would have been maintained as an equilibrium state during the entire Neogene is unclear. The model of an Arctic circulation dominated by seawater subduction off the Russian coast contrasts with today's picture, in which the Arctic is under a steady North Atlantic influence. In sketching the Arctic's sensitivity to past climate change, Haley  et al . underscore its vulnerability to further change today. Reprints and Permissions"},

A century ago, matrices and the techniques for their manipulation \u2014 linear algebra \u2014 were a backwater of mathematics. Today, they are the foundation not just of the mathematical field of numerical analysis, but also of computational science and engineering, and have become indispensable for anyone who wants to get numerical results from a computer. The pre-eminent figure in matrix computations over the past 50 years, Gene Golub, died on 16 November. Golub was born in Chicago on 29 February 1932, to Jewish parents from Latvia and the Ukraine. His childhood was not affluent, but he was a good student. After two years at a junior college, he transferred to the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, achieving his doctorate there in 1959. At the time, Illinois, with the first of its 'ILLIAC' supercomputers, was a great centre of computing, and Golub showed his affection for his Alma Mater by endowing a chair there 50 years later. Rumour has it that the funds for the gift came from Google stock acquired in exchange for some advice on linear algebra. Google's PageRank search technology starts from a matrix computation \u2014 an eigenvalue problem with dimensions in the billions. Hardly surprising, Golub would have said: everything is linear algebra. He came to believe that in his twenties, as he realized that new methods of orthogonal-matrix factorization introduced by Wallace Givens and Alston Householder offered the right mathematical recipe for solving all kinds of problems. In particular, Golub focused on the idea known as singular value decomposition, SVD, which systematically isolates the dominant components of a linear process. Together with William Kahan and Christian Reinsch, he invented the now-standard SVD algorithms, and showed scientists, engineers and statisticians how these algorithms could be used in areas such as the least-squares method to find the best fit to a curve; in optimization problems and control theory; and for the determination of crucial matrix parameters such as their norms, ranks and condition numbers. In later years he drove a car with the licence plate 'PROF SVD'. Golub found his way to Stanford University in 1962, eventually becoming the senior professor in its formidable computer science department. In 45 productive years there, he advanced matrix computations in areas as diverse as geodesy, data mining and quantum chromodynamics. The dimension of what was considered a 'big' matrix grew from 100 to 1,000,000 in the same period, and Golub was among the first to develop the iterative algorithms that make problems involving such huge matrices tractable. As the new methods came in, older ideas such as gaussian elimination (essentially, the way one is taught to solve a system of simultaneous equations in school, by eliminating the variables one by one) became a smaller part of a new and greater enterprise. Along with the new algorithms came a new world of software for solving mathematical problems, such as EISPACK, LAPACK and MATLAB. Golub's book  Matrix Computations , co-authored with Charles Van Loan of Cornell University, became a bestseller and the definitive textbook of the field. Honours flowed in, including membership of the US National Academies. As a servant of the wider scientific community, Golub did as much as anybody to make the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM) the organization it is today. He served it in various capacities, among them as president (1985\u201387). He also founded and edited two of the society's journals, the  SIAM Journal on Scientific and Statistical Computing  and  SIAM Journal on Matrix Analysis and Applications . It was his proposal that led to the quadrennial International Congresses on Industrial and Applied Mathematics. But this impressive list of achievements misses the truly extraordinary aspect of this complex man: the scale of his devotion to people. Golub was a bachelor for most of his life, and his colleagues were his family. No family ever had a more loving, attentive or exasperating father. As he liked to say, \u201cEvery numerical analyst has a second home at Stanford\u201d. Countless colleagues enjoyed a glass of wine at his home there, and hundreds of them stayed over for a night or even a month at his invitation. How did he remember all our birthdays and reading tastes and children's names? Golub could not spend a day without other people. He would eat dinner with them, talk matrices with them, organize conferences with them, write papers and books with them, argue academic politics with them \u2014 an endless dance of interactions, plans and projects. Anywhere in the world, a numerical analyst knows who is meant by 'Gene'. About 250 of them were his co-authors. They knew that it would fall to them to do most of the writing; but Golub saw the connections, knew the literature, and made the paper happen. He seemed almost to have invented e-mail. As early as 1981, his office computer was set up to beep the moment a message arrived. His personal address list evolved into the worldwide database of numerical analysts, and his notes to friends became the Numerical Analysis Digest. This newsletter, one of the first e-bulletins, is now sent to some 8,000 recipients weekly. He could not sit still. As he left us in Oxford last September after an extended sabbatical visit, having spent much of the preceding months talking with the graduate students in the common room \u2014 to which he had donated $1,000 for a biscuit fund \u2014 he mentioned that he had three trips to China planned for the upcoming year. Gene Golub was restless and never entirely happy. He was a demanding friend; behind his back, we all had Gene stories to tell. It was a huge back: Gene was big, dominating any room he was in, and grew more impressive and imposing with the years. Graduate students around the world admired and loved him, and he bought them all dinner when he got the chance. His unexpected death, in Stanford in between speaking at a conference in Hong Kong and flying to Zurich for his eleventh honorary degree, has left the world of numerical analysis orphaned and reverberating.

McFadden"}], "parsed_as_year": "2006_or_before", "body": "Our knowledge of the inner workings of malaria parasites comes largely from lab-based studies. But parasites growing in humans may have greater metabolic flexibility than those growing in Petri dishes. Malaria parasites kill more than a million people every year. These minuscule organisms, belonging to the genus  Plasmodium , ensconce themselves inside our red blood cells. They eat our oxygen-carrying haemoglobin protein, and sup on the rich supply of glucose in our blood plasma. Hidden from our immune system within our own cells, they multiply exponentially, inducing anaemia, acidity of the blood, low blood sugar, fluid build-up in the lungs, seizures and blockage of brain capillaries \u2014 complications that can kill a person within ten days of being infected by a malaria-carrying mosquito. Until now, we believed that malaria parasites burned the glucose they stole from our plasma using a simple and relatively inefficient process known as glycolysis. After all, why would a parasite bother to extract maximum energy from glucose when abundant free glucose is at hand? On  page 1091  of this issue, however, Daily and colleagues 1  show that, in some infections, the parasites behave as if they are starving, cranking up genes involved in energy-harvesting pathways to wring out the maximum burn from the proceeds of their parasitism. Switching on these genes could enable parasites to engage the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, the cellular motor that burns the leftover fuel from glycolysis to allow energy production to shift into top gear (see Fig. 4 of the paper 1  on page 1093). Intriguingly, the different parasite behaviours might correlate with different disease profiles, potentially explaining why different patients experience radically different symptoms during severe malaria infections. Without a straightforward, easily accessible animal model for the deadliest malaria species,  Plasmodium falciparum , lab work on the disease has been a difficult proposition. In 1976, a seminal paper 2  described a method of growing  P. falciparum  in Petri dishes of glucose-rich human blood with reduced oxygen levels. This method, essentially unchanged, is used in all modern malaria labs; it underpins all quests for a cure, whether they involve drug screens, genetic studies, genome sequencing, immunology, biochemistry or cell biology. Post-genomic studies have painstakingly mapped the expression levels of every gene and the quantities of each encoded protein across the orderly 48-hour part of the life cycle that the parasite executes in red blood cells 3 , 4 , 5 . These studies reinforced the view that genes encoding the proteins required for glycolysis are abundantly expressed during this part of the life cycle. The parasites were all perceived to be marching to a rigid, yet energy-profligate rhythm, apparently oblivious to the world around them \u2014 us. Studying pandas in a zoo is not the same as studying them in the wild. Likewise, these lab-based  in vitro  culture studies might not accurately reflect how the parasites behave in their natural environment. Hence the approach adopted by Daily  et al . 1 , who took blood from patients infected with  P. falciparum  in Senegal, and used microarray DNA chip technology to generate a parasite gene-expression profile for each patient. In many patients, parasite profiles were the same as those observed in lab-cultured parasites \u2014 the parasites seemed to be running on energy derived from glycolysis. But parasites from two other groups of patients exhibited very different, and hitherto unseen, gene-expression profiles. In one group, the parasites had upregulated stress-response genes, probably to cope with host immune pressure. In the other group, they had downregulated the glycolysis genes normally switched on in lab-cultured parasites, but up-regulated genes involved in alternative means of energy generation, a trait seen, for instance, in yeast cells starved of glucose. These results imply that there are physiological differences in the growth of parasite populations in different individuals. In other words, malaria parasites do not always grow in humans as they do in Petri dishes. The changes in gene expression seen in 'starved' parasites are particularly curious. Two subcellular compartments (organelles) in the malaria parasite, the apicoplast and the mitochondrion, may hold the key to the apparent metabolic switching seen here. The apicoplast is a chloroplast-like organelle thought to have been originally photosynthetic but now retained for the biosynthesis of lipid building-blocks known as fatty acids 6 . Mitochondria harbour the enzymes of the TCA cycle as well as an energy-generating electron-transport chain that together finish the incineration of glucose and other substrates to increase energy yields. Both apicoplast fatty-acid synthesis and mitochondrial energy-production genes are dramatically upregulated in the 'starved' parasites 1 . What drives these differences in gene expression? Although apicoplast fatty-acid biosynthesis is essential for successful infection 7 , its exact role is unclear because malaria parasites can scavenge fatty acids from their host. Upregulation of the apicoplast pathway for fatty-acid synthesis may suggest an increased need for fatty acids or a short supply of them from hosts. Similarly, upregulation of pathways involved in efficient mitochondrial energy generation implies either an increased need for energy or a reduced supply of glucose for glycolysis. A recent study 8  on laboratory-grown parasites concluded that mitochondria are not required for energy generation. But Daily and colleagues' discovery of the upregulation of genes involved in these mitochondrial energy-synthesizing pathways suggests that this may not always be the case. The findings presented here raise various questions. What causes the different parasite gene-expression profiles? Do these profiles reflect distinct temporal stages of  in vivo  parasite development, or are they discrete snapshots of an intense battle between parasite and host? Are parasites initiating these differences, or are they merely reacting to cues from the host? Patient factors such as blood glucose levels, the amount of haemoglobin and the number of parasites in the blood do not seem to be linked to the starvation response. If there is an environmental cue, it is a subtle one. One caveat in interpreting Daily and colleagues' results 1  is that gene upregulation doesn't always translate to metabolic upregulation; biochemical validation of actual metabolic switching is needed, and this will probably require elicitation of the starvation response in laboratory-grown parasites. At a more practical level, it will be important to understand whether different parasite gene-expression profiles are linked to the spectrum of disease experienced by patients with malaria, which, in turn, may point to more effective treatments. For example, drugs targeting fatty-acid biosynthesis and the mitochondrial electron-transport chain 8 , 9  should be especially effective against parasites in starvation mode. We have come a long way in understanding malaria and its causes. But the findings presented by Daily  et al . 1  show that we are just beginning to comprehend the complexity of the metabolic engine that drives these parasites. Reprints and Permissions"},

Baker"}], "parsed_as_year": "2006_or_before", "body": "Passionate biochemist with a love for enzymes. Arthur Kornberg was one of the greatest biochemists of the twentieth century. His career spanned more than 60 years, and such has been the impact of his work on modern biomedical science that his influence will endure for decades. Kornberg was born in Brooklyn, New York, to a family of modest means. He had no exposure to science as a child; the young Arthur collected matchbook covers, the dominant flora of the Brooklyn streets, rather than the insects usually associated with a scientifically inclined youngster. He nonetheless opted to study chemistry and biology, and received his bachelor's degree from the City College of New York, one of three students from the class of 1937 destined to receive the Nobel prize (Herbert Hauptman and Jerome Karle were the others). He went on to earn an MD from the University of Rochester, New York, where he wrote his first research paper on a mild form of jaundice he discovered in himself and classmates. For a short period he was a (self-described) attentive physician, first in New York, and then in the US Navy. But it was a transfer to the Public Health Service in 1942, which landed him at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), that was the turning point of his career. At the NIH, and during research with Severo Ochoa at the New York University School of Medicine, and with Carl and Gerty Cori at Washington University School of Medicine, Kornberg turned to the study of enzymes, which he loved and considered the vital force in biology. He initially analysed enzymes involved in the synthesis of nucleotides and related small molecules. Nucleotides are the building-blocks of the molecule of heredity, DNA. Kornberg soon turned to the search for an enzyme that could synthesize this polynucleotide chain. His inspiration was not the 1953 Watson\u2013Crick structure of DNA, but rather the Coris' work on the enzymatic synthesis of other biological macromolecules. Kornberg had taken on a daunting task. A guiding principle of his research, however, was that a persistent biochemist could reconstitute any cellular event in a test tube. Moreover, he felt that the biochemist had the advantage of being able to optimize the reaction without the burden of working under the constraints imposed by cells. Kornberg set up a reaction containing DNA, radioactive thymidine (a nucleoside) and protein fractions obtained by breaking open  Escherichia coli , an intestinal bacterium. Initially, only a tiny fraction of the labelled thymidine was converted into a form that seemed to be a DNA-like molecule. But, with this glimmer of activity (and many controls demonstrating reaction specificity) Kornberg persevered, and eventually found the proper form of the building-blocks needed for efficient synthesis.  Late in 1957, Kornberg's manuscripts describing the test-tube synthesis of DNA from precursor molecules by an enzyme \u2014 DNA polymerase \u2014 were rejected by  The Journal of Biological Chemistry . Reviewers thought it premature to call the product 'DNA'. In the spring of 1958, however, a new editor stepped in and accepted the papers. Less than two years later, Kornberg's discovery, and the independent work on the synthesis of RNA polymers by Ochoa, were recognized by the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. The enzymology of DNA replication remained Kornberg's passion for the next 30 years. His approach was to build up increasingly complex biochemical reactions that recapitulated cellular DNA replication processes. In 1967, he successfully replicated the DNA of a small virus, a feat that received much attention as it was (incorrectly) reported that he had created \u201clife in a test tube\u201d. This was nonetheless a seminal achievement that defined many of the principles governing DNA replication of all genomes. For example, the concept that special enzymes are needed to start DNA chains, which DNA polymerase then elongates rapidly and with exquisite fidelity, arose from this work. Likewise, Kornberg's work provided insight into the function of origins of replication, the sequences on a chromosome that direct the start of a cycle of DNA replication. In the 1980s, after ten years of effort, Kornberg's group reconstituted the replication of a DNA molecule initiated using a true origin 'cloned' from a cellular chromosome. The resulting model of the steps required for initiation of DNA replication at a chromosomal origin remains the paradigm for investigating replication in more complex organisms today. From 1990, Kornberg's lab focused on the enzymes involved in polyphosphate metabolism. He continued this work until a week before his death on 26 October. Kornberg's impact on modern biology has been enormous. He spearheaded the purification and characterization of many of the enzymes that have become essential tools of genetic engineering. He was also a visionary leader, who had an immense influence on the education of scientists. In 1959, he founded the biochemistry department at Stanford University. There, he forged a remarkable community, in which faculty limited the size of their research groups, pooled grants, and shared space and equipment. He also successfully integrated his work and family life, bringing his children Roger, Tom and Ken, and then his grandchildren, to the lab and to conferences. His first wife, Sylvy (pictured here with him), was a gifted biochemist and worked alongside him for years. To Arthur's great pride and joy, Roger became a colleague at Stanford and, in 2006, received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry. Then there is Arthur's extended scientific family. As a mentor he was passionate about both his science and his people, and held us to the same exacting standards as he held himself. Although fundamentally impatient, he was never too busy or too famous to discuss our data, edit our manuscripts (again, and again, and again), or to critique our presentations. He drove us crazy with his (not so gentle) homilies. \u201cKeep your lab notebook with more accuracy than your cheque-book.\u201d \u201cOnly four lines per graph.\u201d \u201cDon't go home until you find your enzyme activity.\u201d \u201cTime is your most important resource.\u201d But we learned, treasure the memories, and now torture our own students with 'Kornbergisms'. I think Arthur would be pleased. Reprints and Permissions"},

Stewart"}], "parsed_as_year": "2006_or_before", "body": "The p53 protein is widely studied for its function as a tumour suppressor, preventing cancer. It emerges that this protein also has an essential physiological role in regulating embryo implantation in mice. The p53 protein, which has been given the accolade 'guardian of the genome', is a celebrity among cellular proteins. If you search the PubMed database for p53, you'll get more than 44,000 hits, the vast majority of which discuss the role of this protein in protecting cells from the consequences of stress-induced DNA damage. Given the essential role of p53 in preventing tumour formation, the finding that most p53-deficient mice develop normally, and only succumb to tumorigenesis later in life, was surprising 1 . But, on  page 721  of this issue, Hu  et al . 2  show that this familiar transcription factor has an unanticipated \u2014 albeit essential \u2014 role in regulating fertility in female mice. Implantation \u2014 during which the early embryo, or blastocyst, comes into physical contact with the mother's uterus in a highly coordinated way \u2014 is an essential step in the reproduction of most mammals. It leads to the formation of the placenta, which supports the growth and development of the fetus until its birth. Before implantation, the uterus undergoes extensive rounds of cell proliferation and differentiation that make it receptive to a potential blastocyst. These events are primarily regulated by the direct effect of the ovarian steroid hormones oestrogen E2 and progesterone P4 (ref.  3 ), and are further augmented by the induction by these hormones of many locally produced growth factors and immune-mediator proteins (cytokines) 4 Among these is the cytokine LIF, which was first implicated in mammalian development because of its essential function in sustaining mouse embryonic stem cells. LIF is one of many proteins that are produced and secreted by the endometrial glands of the uterus. In many different mammalian species, LIF is most highly expressed at the onset of implantation 5 . In fact, implantation cannot occur unless epithelial cells lining the uterus are exposed to LIF (ref.  6 ) ( Fig. 1 ). Moreover, LIF-deficient female mice, in which blastocysts develop normally, are infertile; but a single injection of LIF into these animals, on the day in which implantation would normally occur (in mice, day 4 of pregnancy), is sufficient to initiate implantation and subsequent normal embryonic development to birth 7 . Hu  et al . 2  now show that p53 plays a significant part in regulating LIF expression in the uterus, and so in female fecundity. These authors were intrigued by the low fertility of p53-deficient female, but not male, mice. They noticed that, although in p53-deficient female mice only low numbers of embryos could implant, the number of healthy embryos produced was not affected. The authors find that p53 regulates the transcription of the mouse  Lif  gene, and that in p53-deficient female mice, expression levels of uterine LIF are reduced about fourfold. The clincher was that the injection of mated p53-deficient females with LIF significantly increased the number of implanted embryos that successfully developed to term. In the uterus, LIF is primarily regulated by E2. Because uterine levels of p53 seem to be constant during the pre-implantation period, and the levels of E2 in p53-deficient female mice are normal, the authors suggest that p53 probably forms a complex with the E2 receptor. They propose that this putative complex is necessary for maximal expression of LIF at day 4 of pregnancy in mice. The function of p53 in regulating fertility is unexpected, as it is not clear why p53, which is usually activated by stress, should regulate  Lif  transcription in the uterus. At implantation, the uterine vascular system undergoes extensive re-plumbing to support the considerable increase in both uterine-cell proliferation (decidualization) and the growth of the embryo itself, and to prevent hypoxia (oxygen shortage). As hypoxia is one of the main stressors that regulate p53 activity 8 , it is possible that with the evolution of the reproductive system of mammalian females, activation of p53 in response to hypoxia was hijacked to help coordinate implantation-associated changes in vascularization. What are the implications of Hu and colleagues' findings for human fecundity? Studies on p53 and its regulators, such as Mdm2, have identified polymorphisms in amino-acid residue 72 of p53, as well as a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP309) in the transcriptional regulatory region of  Mdm2  (ref.  9 ). Both of these polymorphisms are thought to affect the transcriptional activity and the levels of p53 (ref.  10 ). So, in light of Hu and colleagues' data, it is intriguing that the presence of a particular polymorphism (proline substituting for arginine) at residue 72 of p53 strongly correlates with women having recurrent implantation failure 11 . Genetic-variation-associated alterations in the levels of p53 may also influence the levels of this protein in the uterus, which may, in turn, affect LIF levels; reduced levels of LIF are also associated with a decrease in implantation rates in humans 12 . It would therefore be interesting to see whether the SNP309 polymorphism in  Mdm2  is linked to cases of unexplained human infertility. Extensive efforts are under way to identify small-molecule regulators of p53, in order to suppress tumour growth. Such molecules might also be useful in enhancing implantation rates as part of fertility treatments, or even for inhibiting implantation as a means of contraception. Reprints and Permissions"},

Joyce"}], "parsed_as_year": "2006_or_before", "body": "Chemist, molecular biologist and pioneer in the study of the origins of life.  Leslie Orgel was a brilliant man who excelled in two very different scientific areas. So disparate were these fields that most would think his accomplishments were those of two different individuals. Chemists know of his classic work on devising 'ligand-field theory', which provides an understanding of the structural and physical properties of transition-metal complexes. 'Orgel diagrams' have become a standard way to depict the various energy states of these complexes, and Orgel was recognized for his achievements in this area by his election as a fellow of the Royal Society at the unusually young age of 35. But a broader group of people know that Orgel set the agenda for the experimental study of the origins of life. He pursued that agenda with vigour and intellectual clarity right up until his death on 27 October. Born in London, Orgel began his career as a chemist at the University of Oxford. But it wasn't long before his second love for biology became apparent. Orgel was one of the small circle of scientists who were present at the birth of molecular biology. Between 1954 and 1955 he worked at the California Institute of Technology with Linus Pauling, purportedly engaged in theoretical chemistry. But Orgel spent most of his time that year talking with the founding fathers of molecular biology \u2014 such as Alex Rich and James Watson \u2014 and learning from the likes of George Beadle and Max Delbr\u00fcck, who later won Nobel prizes for their work on genetics. From 1955 to 1963, Orgel was a faculty member in theoretical chemistry at the University of Cambridge, where he wrote his seminal book on ligand-field theory. It was here that his enthusiasm for biology grew through extensive conversations with Sydney Brenner and Francis Crick. Orgel was a member of the RNA Tie Club, an informal association of academics who aimed to solve the DNA coding problem \u2014 the relationship between the sequence of a gene and that of its corresponding protein. Each member was assigned a different amino acid (Orgel was threonine) or nucleotide base, and given a woollen tie decorated with a stylized double helix. Club members exchanged ideas freely, and played a large part in getting Orgel hooked on molecular biology. By 1964, when he moved to the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, his second scientific career had begun. The seeds of Orgel's arguably greatest contributions to science were planted in 1953, when Stanley Miller performed an influential experiment in what would become the field of prebiotic chemistry. Miller demonstrated the abiotic synthesis of amino acids in a mixture of gases that was thought to simulate the atmosphere of the prebiotic Earth. This experiment was highly significant to Orgel, and when he went to La Jolla he sought to address the problems of life's origins by integrating prebiotic chemistry and molecular biology. Accordingly, his focus was not on the machinery of contemporary metabolism (amino acids that form proteins), but on the machinery of a primitive genetic system (nucleotides that form RNA). Orgel addressed many aspects of the origins of life on Earth, including the prebiotic synthesis of the building-blocks of nucleic acids, the joining together of nucleotides to form polynucleotides, and the non-enzymatic copying of RNA. He was the first to demonstrate that information can be transferred from a preformed RNA template to a newly synthesized RNA molecule in a purely chemical system. The concept of information transfer was critical for Orgel because his ultimate goal was to demonstrate a chemical system that is capable of undergoing darwinian evolution. \u201cAfter that,\u201d he would say, \u201cthe rest is just history.\u201d The origin of life, in his view, is defined as the origin of evolutionary history. In the late 1960s, Orgel \u2014 along with Crick and the microbiologist Carl Woese \u2014 proposed that early life on Earth was based on RNA genes and RNA enzymes, rather than DNA genes and protein enzymes as it is today. Fifteen years later, following the Nobel-prizewinning discovery by Thomas Cech and Sidney Altman of RNA enzymes in contemporary biology, Orgel's proposal came to be known as the 'RNA world' hypothesis. I was a graduate student in the Orgel laboratory when word came that Cech had discovered self-splicing RNA enzymes. No work was done at the bench that day; everyone was at the blackboard, as Orgel led a rapid-fire discussion of how an RNA enzyme might bring about the replication of RNA, and of how such an enzyme might arise. At afternoon tea \u2014 a tradition in the Orgel laboratory \u2014 Crick joined the conversation and the pace quickened. There was no crowing from Orgel that he had predicted catalytic RNA, and no complaining that he had overlooked the possibility that RNA enzymes might still exist today \u2014 only the joy of fresh scientific ideas triggered by new experimental facts. Although Orgel was a theoretician, he always demanded that theory be subject to rigorous experimental validation. This, he felt, was especially true in the field of the origins of life, where \u201ctheories are a dime a dozen and facts are in short supply\u201d. He took great pleasure in a positive result, to the point of rooting for the pen on a graph-plotter during chromatography experiments. But he also delighted in negative results, because they pushed him to devise new hypotheses. This, of course, is the way scientists are supposed to behave, but Orgel was one of the few who actually did so. Following the discovery of catalytic RNA, Orgel continued to pursue the RNA-world hypothesis as both a strong proponent and a tough critic. He pointed out that the notion of an RNA world hardly solves the problem of the origins of life, and suggested that RNA was preceded by some other genetic material, just as DNA and protein were preceded by RNA. Many of his later publications concerned experimental studies of possible pre-RNA-world molecules. His theories brought him into conflict with creationists, who sometimes quoted Orgel out of context, pointing to his admitted uncertainty about life's origins as if this were a failing of the scientific approach. It was, of course, typical of Orgel and of the best practice of science. He had no time for proponents of 'intelligent design', and avoided those prone to magical thinking. When engaged in scientific discourse, Orgel was intellectually demanding, but never unkind. As his student \u2014 and over the decades since then \u2014 if I were to advance a dunderheaded hypothesis, he would frown slightly and begin his corrective response with the words: \u201cWith respect\u2026\u201d. Like all those who knew him, I had the deepest respect for Leslie as a scientist, colleague and dear friend. Reprints and Permissions"},

Why should we care? Because sequences that have resisted the selective forces of evolution from fly to human must have functional significance. Geneticists and molecular biologists have always had a soft spot for the fruitfly  Drosophila melanogaster , for this innocuous organism is continually providing insights into the biology of multicellular organisms. But in the 1990s, when the nematode worm  Caenorhabditis elegans  became the life and soul of the genomics party, and we humans were always the guests of honour, flies were in danger of being left off the guest list. This started to change when Celera Genomics 1  sequenced the genome of  D. melanogaster  as a trial, before tackling the genomes of larger species. Now, in the era of evolutionary genomics, the sequencing of 10, and comparative analysis of 12, fly species \u2014 reported in this issue 2 , 3  and elsewhere in more than 40 companion papers \u2014 means that flies have overtaken other species to become a favourite organism of genomicists too. Every aspect of an organism emerges and persists through evolution. Consequently, researchers have always used evolutionary analysis to understand genomes, in particular to identify protein-coding genes that are conserved between organisms. But evolutionary processes can be studied far more effectively than by merely cataloguing the gene content of a genome. Specifically, researchers can investigate two complementary evolutionary aspects: negative selection and positive selection. Stark  et al . 2  ( page 219 ) study negative selection, or the presence of functional genomic elements that, despite having undergone many random mutational events, have not changed in function ( Fig. 1a ). By contrast, the  Drosophila  12 Genomes Consortium (Clark and colleagues,  page 203 ) 3  investigate positive selection, or the acquisition of new functions in different species ( Fig. 1b ). The remarkable diversity of fruitfly species makes them ideal organisms for such comparative analysis. Consequently, the authors studied closely related species such as  D. simulans  (pictured) and  D. sechellia  (which have a genetic distance equivalent to that between humans and closely related primates), as well as more distant drosophilids such as  D. grimshawi . This is one of the many exotic Hawaiian species, and is physically 100 times bigger than its normal laboratory cousins, with a genetic distance between them equivalent to that between humans and lizards.  To discover functional elements and to refine our understanding of elements already known, Stark  et al . 2  draw on most of our current knowledge of these elements, and use nature's own repertoire of mutations and selection. They consider all known classes of functional element \u2014 from the well-understood protein-coding genes to the more elusive motifs that regulate gene expression. These analyses allowed the authors to identify incorrect biological information ascribed to specific genomic sequences of  D. melanogaster . Stark and colleagues identify several evolutionarily conserved elements embedded in continuous sequences of coding DNA. These include stop codons (three-nucleotide sequences that signal termination of a protein sequence) and frameshift mutations, which throw the coding sequence out of step. It is hard to imagine that such gene structures \u2014 in which, for example, stop codons transcribed into messenger RNAs are ignored by the protein-translation machinery \u2014 are compatible with the normal rules of translation. So these findings strongly indicate the existence of additional, as yet unknown, mechanisms for the pre-translational processing of mRNAs, or alternative modes of translation. MicroRNAs are short sequences of naturally occurring, single-stranded RNA that regulate gene expression. The authors next investigated genes for non-coding RNA sequences, such as microRNAs, and identify new microRNA sequences, thereby expanding the list of these regulatory sequences in  D. melanogaster  from 74 to 101. Regulatory motifs are another type of functional element Stark  et al . studied. The authors provide both an extensive 'dictionary' of such motifs and, for the first time in a genome-wide manner for an organism, a set of instances in which such motifs are putatively functional. Using genomics to identify cases of regulatory-motif activity is, indeed, an exciting new approach, and uses what the authors call 'branch length score'. This method takes into account the alignment and sequencing errors that are common in real data, and it can be applied to the whole of a phylogenetic tree. Stark  et al . carefully assess different statistical aspects of their method, providing a goldmine of functional elements that can be confidently used by molecular biologists studying flies and by laboratories interested in gene regulation. Compared with the work of Stark  et al ., Clark and colleagues' findings 3  on aspects of positive selection are of less direct use to molecular biologists working on  D. melanogaster . Instead, their results provide for the first time a comprehensive set of genome-wide insights into how organisms arise during evolution. Statistically, the authors' analysis is not as powerful as that of Stark and colleagues. But this is not surprising, because their aim was to understand positive selection, which occurs in a non-continuous manner across the different  Drosophila  lineages, whereas the negative selection studied by Stark  et al . is relatively constant and can easily be aggregated across the entire data set ( Fig. 1 ). Nevertheless, Clark and colleagues provide valuable insights into the evolution of  Drosophila  species. For example, by comparing the genomes of 12 drosophilid species, 10 of which they have sequenced and present in this issue, they show that, on both large and small scales, genomic rearrangements are extremely common in these genomes. They also find that about a third of the genes have undergone positive selection through mutations that affect the position of at least one amino acid. This suggests that positive selection occurs across many genes in a genome. Codon-usage bias is the selective use by an organism of certain codons from a pool of codons that all specify a given amino acid, and it varies between different organisms. Clark and colleagues discover that, compared with other drosophilids, one species,  D. willistoni , shows substantially reduced codon-usage bias. The authors also show that genes encoding proteins involved in olfaction and immunity \u2014 the usual suspects for positive selection among protein-coding genes \u2014 have evolved faster than the rest of the genome. Rapid evolution was also seen in genes that regulate specific aspects of  Drosophila  physiology, such as insecticide resistance. During its long association with humans,  Drosophila  has endured radical changes to its environment, ranging from the introduction of insecticides to the transfer of species through human migration. We can therefore probably expect many interesting studies attempting to correlate genomic changes with such events in the fly's evolutionary history. What are the broader implications of the findings of these two studies 2 , 3 , particularly for further study of the human genome? In the case of negative selection, the evolutionary-genomics approach taken by Stark  et al . clearly provides impressive insights into functional elements that are conserved across a clade (a group of related organisms). The proposed Mammalian Genome Project 4 , which is well under way, is likely to have roughly the same statistical power as Stark and colleagues' data set. This would mean that we have a collection of powerful exploratory methods that can be applied to large-scale genomic analysis in mammals, and that are complementary to experimental techniques. In theory, there should be no qualitative difference in generating results for the  Drosophila  and mammalian clades using these methods. Nonetheless, the larger size of mammalian genomes, and the fact that there are potentially more fluctuations in the rate of neutral evolution, both across the genome of one species and between genomes of different species, may pose some interesting problems to be overcome. Researchers are concerned that data obtained using methods based on evolutionary-genomic analysis do not entirely overlap with those obtained through experimental discovery methods, such as ChIP-chip and ChIP-seq, which generate comprehensive  in vivo  maps of transcription-factor binding sites and other functional DNA elements. In particular, these experimental techniques often define a set of elements that are not identified as conserved by the sensitive criteria of evolutionary-genomic analysis. As discussed previously 5  and by Stark  et al ., this mismatch seems to be consistent across species and analyses performed by different laboratories. So it probably reflects our lack of understanding of how seemingly neutral evolutionary processes give rise to new, biochemically active elements before selection kicks in, rather than the existence of a large portion of lineage-specific elements, or defects in the methods used. The analysis of positive selection by Clark and colleagues 3  is undoubtedly the broadest and most detailed investigation performed in any clade of multicellular organisms. Their study emphasizes the fact that, to understand differences between species, and thus how evolution leads to adaptive changes, we must improve the methods we use, and look at larger data sets and a broader range of species. This argument favours both sequencing the genomes of more species \u2014 now a realistic prospect given the advent of radically cheaper sequencing technologies \u2014 and determined efforts to carry out experimental studies on other members of each clade. Such studies are essential to any attempts to correlate sequence changes with changes in functional elements, and so test any new methods developed. For the drosophilids, the next phase should entail sequencing the genomes of yet more fruitflies and other members of the order Diptera, thereby adding to the sequenced genomes of the drosophilids discussed here and their distant cousins, mosquitoes 6 , 7 . Moreover, more sequences should be generated at the population level \u2014 that is, we should sequence several individuals of the same species to gather the raw material for classical population-genetic analysis, which can be used for comparison with evolutionary data. Attempts to generate such resources are well under way for some drosophilid species. Finally, concerted efforts to obtain new experimental results in other species, beyond the experimental workhorse  D. melanogaster , are needed for comparison with data obtained through evolutionary analysis. Clark and colleagues' findings suggest that, to understand the fascinating adaptive changes among primates, including those unique to humans, we probably need to sequence the genome of every extant primate (and, where possible, any extinct primates with recoverable DNA), using optimal sequencing strategies to obtain both population-level data and accurate genome sequences. Basic molecular-biological studies on cell lines from selected primate species will also be needed to correlate sequence changes with changes in functional elements. Returning to the present, the data presented and analysed by Stark  et al . 2  and Clark and colleagues 3  provide the first significant example of the power of evolutionary genomics, which will be a central research theme for the next decade. It also means that genomicists can finally join their geneticist and molecular-biologist colleagues in the fruitfly fan club. Reprints and Permissions"},

Wolfgang Panofsky \u2014 'Pief' to his friends and colleagues \u2014 died of a heart attack on 24 September at his home in Los Altos, California. He was admired worldwide as a great physicist and the founding director of the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center. But beyond that, he earned universal respect for his humanity and integrity, and for the perseverance with which he fought to achieve the goals that he greatly valued. Panofsky was born in Berlin in 1919, and was raised in Hamburg until 1934, when his father, the eminent art historian Erwin Panofsky, was dismissed from his professorship at the university because he was Jewish. Realizing that their lives were at risk as well as their careers, the Panofsky family sailed to the United States, settling in Princeton, New Jersey. The young Panofsky entered Princeton University at the age of 15, graduating in 1938 with a major in physics, and moved on to the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena for his graduate studies. He received his PhD in 1942 after completing his dissertation based on research in the laboratory of Jesse W. DuMond, whose daughter, Adele, he married the same year. Although officially an enemy alien, Panofsky was granted clearance to work on the atom bomb and other military projects during the Second World War. In 1945 he was recruited by Luis Alvarez to the Radiation Laboratory at the University of California, Berkeley, where he remained for the next six years. These were fruitful years of research in elementary particle physics for Panofsky. Working with several colleagues at the accelerators at the Radiation Lab, he made important measurements of the properties of  \u03c0  mesons (pions, mediators of the strong nuclear force). Most notably, in collaboration with Jack Steinberger, he confirmed the existence of the elusive neutral pion and discovered its decay into two \u03b3-rays. The early 1950s were a time of security witch-hunts and congressional investigations into communist subversion in the United States. Panofsky objected on principle when a loyalty oath was imposed on the faculty at the University of California. Although willing to sign this oath, which was later invalidated by the courts and thrown out, he felt that it made the situation there intolerable and moved to Stanford University in 1951 as a professor of physics. He also assumed directorship of Stanford's High Energy Physics Laboratory, which had an electron linear accelerator that he developed into a powerful research tool. The outstanding productivity of that facility stimulated a proposal to build a two-mile linear accelerator. The result was the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC), with Panofsky serving as director from its authorization in 1961 until 1984. A measure of his leadership and SLAC's success are the three Nobel prizes for discoveries that were made there \u2014 the quark structure of protons and neutrons; the  J / \u03c8  meson whose constituents are the charmed quarks; and the heavy  \u03c4  lepton. Panofsky also supported major advances in accelerator technology, including the development and exploitation of electron\u2013positron storage rings and colliders. As a teacher, Panofsky was renowned for his excellent lectures, his patience and his accessibility. He created the same open, collegial relationship with students that he nurtured at SLAC for the entire staff, top to bottom. On the wider stage, he was committed to supporting international collaboration in science, and to advancing the cause of arms control and peace in a world in which nuclear weapons of enormously devastating potential were proliferating. He pursued those efforts with great vigour, whether at Pugwash disarmament meetings, participating in official government or National Academy of Sciences conferences and working panels, or through his wide network of personal contacts. He fostered bonds of cooperation in the belief that they were of great importance even beyond their value to science. He saw improving the mutual understanding and trust between otherwise estranged communities in countries with confrontational relationships, particularly in the Soviet Union and China, as steps towards reducing the misunderstandings that could trigger a nuclear holocaust. Panofsky's commitment to international cooperation in high-energy physics started as far back as the 1950s, including serving on the high-energy physics subcommittee of the International Union of Pure and Applied Physics. It continued to the end of his life, with his work as an adviser for the scientific programme at China's Institute of High Energy Physics in Beijing. He took special interest in the Beijing Electron/Positron Collider, which SLAC strongly supported. As a White House science adviser during the administrations of presidents Dwight D. Eisenhower and John F. Kennedy, Panofsky's technical contributions were instrumental in the negotiation between the United States and the Soviet Union that led, in 1963, to the Limited Test Ban Treaty that prohibited all except underground nuclear explosive tests. Throughout his life, he fought for a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, and against the decision to deploy ballistic-missile defences, on the grounds of their technical limitations and ineffectiveness against massive attacks. In 1977, his prominence in arms control drew the attention of  Playboy  magazine. The article pointed out that \u201cHe is 5-feet, 2-inches tall, weighs 150 pounds, neither smokes nor drinks, and is manifestly, painfully indifferent to clothes\u201d \u2014 but that, as a \u201ckey figure in the Strangelove business\u201d, he had helped the US government avoid pitfalls it might otherwise have stumbled into. Panofsky received just about every honour that science, academia and a national government can bestow. His awards included the National Medal of Science and the Enrico Fermi Award from the US government. His many contributions to scientific collaborations were recognized by his election as an honorary member of the leading scientific societies in the United Kingdom, France, Russia and China. Pief spent the last day of his life in his office at SLAC, writing and arguing for arms control, and looking forward to the publication of his informal autobiography,  Panofsky on Physics, Politics, and Peace: Pief Remembers , which appeared the following week. He is survived by his wife Adele DuMond Panofsky, 5 children and 11 grandchildren. Reprints and Permissions"},

Dobson"}], "parsed_as_year": "2006_or_before", "body": "Protein aggregation causes problems for biotechnology and leads to many fatal human diseases. But a grasp of the physical principles involved enables 'superproteins' to be designed that have exceptional solubilities. Proteins evolved under the stringent conditions imposed by the cellular environment. This means that, out of the vast number of possible amino-acid sequences in proteins, only a tiny fraction actually occur in nature. The advent of protein engineering 1  provides an opportunity to create proteins that have sequences that have never been found in living organisms, and that could have properties unparalleled in their natural counterparts. Reporting in the  Journal of the American Chemical Society , Liu and colleagues 2  show that it is possible to design functional proteins with very high electrostatic charge that turn out to be far more soluble in water than their naturally occurring analogues. Although a detailed knowledge of the biological factors that influence the behaviour of proteins is crucial to an in-depth understanding of their fundamental nature, considerable insights can also be gained by examining their physical and chemical properties. This idea has been reinforced by the discovery 3  that such properties are closely linked to the tendency of proteins to aggregate into non-functional polymeric structures, often known as amyloid assemblies. These structures are best known as the basis for the plaques that form in Alzheimer's disease, and they, or their precursors, can be highly toxic 3 . The need to avoid aggregation has limited amino-acid sequences to those that yield proteins with a relatively narrow range of specific physical attributes \u2014 such as hydrophobicity and net electrostatic charge. Yet natural proteins have overcome many of these limitations to exhibit a wide range of solubilities. Such versatility enables them to work in diverse environments \u2014 from nonpolar lipid membranes to the acid-bath of the stomach \u2014 and suggests that altering their solubility even more radically could result in artificial, 'high-performance' proteins. Moreover, if enzymes can be made to function in inorganic solvents other than water 4 , and in organic solvents other than the lipids that make up biological membranes 5 , new catalytic roles might emerge. This type of research has great potential for the chemical industry, and already allows carefully engineered proteins to be self-assembled into technologically valuable materials in the laboratory 6 . It follows, too, that a promising therapeutic strategy 7  to combat protein-deposition disorders such as Alzheimer's disease is to produce slightly more soluble versions of the proteins whose aggregation is the root cause of the problem. Such modified proteins will reduce the tendency of their natural counterparts to aggregate, while remaining compatible with their cellular environment 8 . This strategy might be aided by the actions of molecular 'chaperones' that protect the mutated proteins and promote their safe interactions with their environment 9 . With all of this in mind, Liu and colleagues 2  set out to increase the solubility of proteins dramatically. They began by modifying green fluorescent protein (GFP), which is widely used as an optical reporter for monitoring cellular processes. Using protein engineering, the authors produced GFP variants with a net charge ranging from \u221230 to +46; for comparison, the net charge of most natural proteins is in the range of \u221210 to +10. By clever design, these supercharged versions of GFP not only maintained their structural stability  in vitro , but also remained soluble when exposed to conditions that normally cause proteins to aggregate \u2014 such as heating to high temperatures, or treatment with a chemical additive that causes the protein to denature. Liu and colleagues 2  then went on to modify other proteins, and found that the process of supercharging can be achieved without altering the proteins' normal functions. The authors' results 2  are impressive. It will be fascinating to explore the extent to which such radically altered proteins can avoid unfavourable interactions  in vivo  with other cellular components, interactions that could result in toxicity. Even if such events occur, an armoury of additional design tools is available to modify the proteins further to provide therapeutic compounds. More generally, the evidence from this study 2  suggests that the ability to use protein engineering and design techniques in new ways to sample largely unexplored amino-acid sequences holds great promise for applications in medicine, biotechnology and even materials science. These opportunities arise from the recognition that it may be possible to overcome the stringent limitations that evolution has imposed on the physical and chemical properties of naturally occurring proteins.

The sequence was published online on 26 August and now appears in print (The French\u2013Italian Public Consortium for Grapevine Genome Characterization  Nature   449 , 463\u2013467; 2007). The grape variety concerned is Pinot Noir, the classic red grape of Burgundy. But the vine sequenced does not produce exactly the same grape as that grown in the vineyards. The consortium chose to sequence a variety called PN40024, which has been bred by successive self-crossings to reduce the high degree of sequence variation that is characteristic of all grapevine varieties. The inbred strain allows efficient assembly of a high-quality sequence from whole-genome shotgun sequence data. In the shotgun technique the DNA is broken into many small fragments for sequencing and then reassembled from overlapping sequences. The resulting genome sequence carries the imprint of millennia of selective breeding. For example, there are 116 genes and pseudogenes for terpene synthases, almost three times the number in the other three plant genomes so far sequenced. These enzymes synthesize the terpenoids that contribute to the aroma and flavour of wines, and pathways associated with tannins are similarly amplified. Less obviously a target of selectivity are the genes that control the synthesis of resveratrol, the antioxidant credited with the health benefits claimed for moderate consumption of red wine. Yet there is a modest expansion, compared with the other sequenced plants, of the stilbene synthase genes associated with resveratrol synthesis. So can we look forward to genetically engineered 'designer' wines? Probably not. There is a market for new grapes, as exemplified by Cabernet Sauvignon clone 337, which is gaining ground in California's Napa Valley. But the flavour and aroma of wine depend on many other factors, such as growth conditions and production methods. And when it comes to producing wines with greater health-giving properties, the prospect sounds too good to be true. So it probably is. However, grapevines are notoriously susceptible to pathogens and stresses, such as drought, that other  Vinus  species can resist. The availability of this genome sequence should speed up progress on introducing the appropriate resistance into economically important varieties of  V. vinifera . With one grapevine genome sequenced, the way is clear for comparative oenogenomics. Yet when it comes to taste, perhaps the differences between a Pinot Noir with earthy and berry notes and a spicy or blowsy Gew\u00fcrztraminer are best left to the realms of individual taste and a good thesaurus.

George Perry and colleagues conclude that such differences in the amount of dietary starch have moulded the human genome over time (G. H. Perry  et al .  Nature Genet . doi:10.1038/ng2123; 2007). Dietary shifts \u2014 whether driven by the development of stone tools, by controlling fire or by domesticating plants and animals \u2014 have had a major role in human evolution. Perry and colleagues specifically looked at the effect of dietary starch on the number of copies of  AMY1 , the gene that encodes the salivary amylase enzyme, which breaks down starch. AMY1  is one of the few genes in the human genome that show extensive copy-number variation between individuals. So the authors first looked at whether additional  AMY1  copies are functional. They found that extra  AMY1  copies do indeed endow the individuals carrying them with the capacity to produce more salivary amylase. The question then was whether the starch content of past diets dictates the present levels of amylase and, thus,  AMY1  copy number. Perry  et al . studied two groups: one consisted of four populations with a low-starch diet and the other of three populations from agricultural societies and hunter\u2013gatherers in arid environments, who traditionally eat high-starch food. Strikingly, twice as many members of the high-starch-diet group had at least six copies of  AMY1 . This difference could not be explained by geographical factors because both groups contained people of Asian and African origin. Instead, the authors propose that variations in  AMY1  copy number are more likely to have been influenced by positive natural selection. So what is the advantage of having more salivary amylase? Significant digestion of starch occurs during chewing. This is crucial, and probably vital, in people likely to suffer from diarrhoeal diseases. Moreover, after being swallowed, salivary amylase is carried to the stomach and intestines, where it aids other digestive enzymes. Of the three copies of the  AMY1  gene registered in the reference sequence of the human genome, variations in nucleotide sequences are small. This suggests that the duplication of these genes may have occurred relatively recently, possibly even since the evolution of modern humans about 200,000 years ago. So Perry and colleagues' results, and elucidation of copy-number variations in other human genes, could provide insight into our ecological and evolutionary history. Reprints and Permissions"},

Much scientific effort has since focused on the possibility of further calamitous events in the Bay of Bengal, and especially on understanding the southern stretch of the fault that was responsible for the earthquake, and which lies to the west of the island of Sumatra. But the fault's northernmost limit, which extends along the coast of Myanmar (Burma) to Chittagong in Bangladesh and faces the densely populated Ganges delta (pictured), has received relatively little attention. Phil Cummins' conclusion that an active zone still exists off Myanmar, as he reports on  page 75  of this issue, thus makes for disquieting reading (P. R. Cummins  Nature   449 , 75\u201378; 2007). The Sumatra\u2013Andaman earthquake was triggered when the Indian tectonic plate was thrust violently under the southeast Asian plate off the northwestern coast of Sumatra. Although this subduction zone was known to extend farther north through the Andaman Islands, its location and nature in the Myanmar region were less clear. It had been thought that subduction was no longer active in this area, and that the plate boundary extended, not under the sea, but on the land through Myanmar. Cummins bases his alternative hypothesis on previous geological studies and recent geodetic measurements, as well as on historical accounts detailing the effects of past earthquakes. He couples these observations with the fact that the floor of the Bay of Bengal has a thick layer of sediments, up to 20 kilometres deep, fanning out from the mouths of the Ganges and Brahmaputra rivers. This 'Bengal fan' insulates the underlying rock, creating thermal conditions more suited to generating earthquakes. Taken together, the implication is that a long, submarine subduction zone stretches for some 900 kilometres from the northern Andamans to the west of Chittagong. The existence of such a fault requires a thorough re-evaluation of the potential for deadly tsunamis in the northern Bay of Bengal. Cummins' simulation of a large earthquake off the coast of Myanmar and the resultant tsunami shows the devastating effect it could have, and underscores the need for further study and monitoring of rock deformation in this region.

Herrmann"}], "parsed_as_year": "2006_or_before", "body": "Organometallic chemist, and cosmopolitan Bavarian patriot. Ernst Otto Fischer belonged to the generation robbed of its youth by the Nazi regime. His bitter experiences on the Russian front in the Second World War had a powerful influence on the liberal and cosmopolitan sentiments of a scientist who dedicated his career to fundamental research. He died aged 88 on 23 July in Munich, where he had lived and worked all his life. Following his return from war, Fischer studied the chemistry of organometallic complexes under Walter Hieber at Munich's Technische Universit\u00e4t. He and his fellow students had initially to rebuild the badly bombed institute with their own hands. Fischer earned his doctorate there in 1952, with an experimental thesis on a simple synthesis process for the versatile reagent tetracarbonylnickel. But the spur to become a research chemist came from his father, a physics professor, who drew his attention to a 1951 article in  Nature  on a new type of organo-iron compound known as ferrocene (or 'dicyclopentadienyliron'). Fischer was sceptical of the bivalency of iron proposed in the paper to explain the compound's structure. Together with Wolfgang Pfab, he used X-ray diffraction to determine its true structure, in which two five-sided carbon rings sandwich a core of a single iron atom. This forms an especially stable compound, with an electronic structure similar to that of a noble gas. The British chemist Geoffrey Wilkinson had independently come across the same sandwich-compound structure for ferrocene. These were moments of glory that heralded a renaissance of inorganic chemistry. There has been a steady stream of compounds combining metals and organic ligands ever since, with novel structures, reactivities and applications in catalysis. Fischer followed his initial achievement soon afterwards (in 1955) with the discovery of a similar structure, dibenzenechromium, that comprised two six-sided carbon rings sandwiching a chromium atom. This discovery was based purely on theoretical considerations and was made together with his extraordinarily gifted student Walter Hafner. In the face of strong and not always harmonious competition from Wilkinson (who was initially based at Harvard University, and then at Imperial College in London), Fischer's Munich laboratories produced a host of new organometallic compounds in the years that followed. These included the first compounds with metal\u2013carbon double bonds ('carbenes', discovered together with Alfred Maasb\u00f6l in 1964) and metal\u2013carbon triple bonds ('carbynes', with Gerhard Kreis in 1973). Whereas Wilkinson became interested at an early stage in the catalytic effects of these organometallic materials (such as the use of rhodium complexes to catalyse hydrogenation and oxosynthesis reactions), Fischer focused exclusively on investigating the rich structures and reactivities of the new world of organometallic chemistry. The two shared the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1973. The long-term influence of Fischer's extensive experimental work is impressive, and has opened up new horizons, also extending to practical applications. The best example is the technique of 'olefin metathesis', in which bonds between organic building-blocks are redistributed to produce new products useful in medicine and industry. The catalysis cycle of this process involves the formation of a metal\u2013carbene intermediate. Without Fischer's original research, this advance \u2014 which culminated in the Nobel prize awarded to Yves Chauvin, Robert Grubbs and Richard Schrock in 2005 \u2014 would not have been possible. Throughout his life, Ernst Otto Fischer remained deeply attached to his native Bavaria and his home city of Munich. Following his first, brilliant individual research results on ferrocene and similar organometallic complexes, he moved in 1957 to the city's Ludwig-Maximilians-Universit\u00e4t. In 1964, he returned to take the chair of his own mentor, Walter Hieber, at the Technische Universit\u00e4t, a position he held for 20 fruitful years. Fischer's special talent was to radiate delight in all things new, a trait that served to motivate and inspire his charges. A bachelor throughout his life, he regarded the members of his research group as his family. Once he had established their competence \u2014 and he had an unerring instinct for young talent \u2014 he granted them unlimited scope to unleash their creativity. In this way, all the researchers who clustered around him in Munich, more than 200 in total, felt a personal responsibility for the common cause. Shaped in this way, Fischer's students became role models in their turn, shouldering responsibility for the community, passing on knowledge and creating new levels of accountability among an ever-expanding group of researchers. More than a dozen of his postdoctoral students were awarded chair professorships at German universities, and many of his alumni later rose to the higher echelons of the chemical industry. The contributions of Fischer's prot\u00e9g\u00e9s to basic and industrial research has been just as significant. A particularly fitting example is the Wacker process to produce acetaldehyde. This uses an ingeniously simple catalytic conversion technique based on ethylene, oxygen and water, and was devised by Walter Hafner together with another of Fischer's former students, Reinhard Jira. Beyond the realm of chemistry, Ernst Otto Fischer was a highly erudite man who captivated his international colleagues with his profound knowledge of literature and music. He could be both impulsive and contemplative, emollient and combative, and coupled a love of his country with a cosmopolitan outlook \u2014 seemingly contradictory traits that found their human symbiosis in him. For colleagues such as myself, he was the epitome of the contentious, relentless fighter for the freedom of science, who fiercely rejected any manipulative outside influences. He was the grand old man of fundamental research, who would settle for nothing less than creativity and scientific curiosity. With his death, his Bavarian homeland has lost one of its most illustrious sons. He found his final resting place in the Old Cemetery in Munich-Solln on 26 July 2007. Reprints and Permissions"},

This is a tectonically complex and dynamic region, and on 9 July,  AD  551, a catastrophic earthquake and subsequent tsunami hit cities along some 180 km of coast running from Tripoli in the north to Tyre in the south. Contemporary accounts and archaeological evidence attest to the extent of the devastation. Ata Elias and colleagues, based at IPG-Paris and Ifremer, have been exploring the geological context of the  AD  551 earthquake and tsunami, and that of similar events in the same area. As they describe in  Geology  (A. Elias  et al .  Geology   35,  755\u2013758; 2007), they have come up with a fresh line of evidence for the seismic particulars involved. The cause, they conclude, was a sudden rupture of the 'Mount Lebanon thrust', a previously unidentified offshore fault about 150 km in length, which runs close to the Lebanese coast. This satellite image shows the region concerned. The new data come from a geophysical survey involving a towed acoustic system that allowed the deep-sea floor to be imaged. The resulting pictures reveal dramatic submarine scarps and ruptures on the sea floor, akin to those resulting from large-scale seismic activity on land, that have broken through the thick blanket of sediment. The continental shelf is unusually narrow in this region, and the fault comes as close as 8 km to the coastline. Over geological time, movement on this fault has been responsible for elevation of the Mount Lebanon range. Evidence for recurrent seismic activity along this coast comes in particular from sets of raised 'surf-cut benches'. These structures form at sea level; they are marked by the presence of characteristic, reef-like biological constructions that can be dated with carbon isotopes. The lowermost of these benches was violently lifted 80 cm out of the water sometime in the sixth century  AD , and probably marks a simultaneous consequence of the  AD  551 event that devastated the Phoenician cities. From similar features, Elias  et al . estimate that the Mount Lebanon thrust ruptures with a periodicity of some 1,500\u20131,750 years. That might mean an earthquake is overdue, but seismic activity is notoriously unpredictable. Reprints and Permissions"},

In a research career that lasted more than 60 years from 1945 until his death on 23 July, Dan Koshland used his skills as a chemist and highly creative thinker to advance our understanding of proteins and cells. An energetic and caring man, passionate about all aspects of science, his persuasive and insightful leadership greatly strengthened every institution of which he was part. Koshland decided to pursue science after reading, as a young teenager, Paul de Kruif's collection of biographical essays,  Microbe Hunters , and  Arrowsmith , Sinclair Lewis's novel of an idealistic scientist and doctor. After receiving a bachelor's degree in chemistry from the University of California, Berkeley, in 1941, Koshland was recruited to the Manhattan Project, and became a group leader under Glenn Seaborg in the team at the University of Chicago that successfully purified plutonium. When the war ended, he entered graduate school in Chicago under another giant of chemistry, Frank Westheimer, then a young assistant professor. Koshland attributed much of his success to the mentoring and inspiration of these two men. After a brief stint at Harvard, Koshland moved in 1951 to Brookhaven National Laboratory on Long Island, New York, where he focused on understanding through physical organic chemistry how enzymes catalyse biological reactions. He became fascinated by the puzzle of enzyme specificity: how does an enzyme select only one of many closely related molecules as its substrate? At the time, the experts believed that Emil Fischer's 'key\u2013lock' or 'template' theory, proposed in the late nineteenth century, had solved the problem. But Koshland realized that this model of a rigid enzyme could not explain why an enzyme catalyst is much less effective when a distant part of the substrate molecule is removed. The correct answer, published by Koshland in 1958 only after numerous rejections, is that enzymes are activated by changing their shape when they bind their substrates, and that process is influenced by the distant part of the substrate. This principle, called 'induced fit', was eventually confirmed fully through detailed structures of enzyme\u2013substrate complexes produced by X-ray crystallography. Induced shape change has proved to be a ubiquitous phenomenon, applying not only to substrate recognition, but also to much of the regulation of enzyme activity in biological systems. In 1965, Koshland moved back to Berkeley, to the Department of Biochemistry. A year later, he published a classic paper, 'Comparison of experimental binding data and theoretical models in proteins containing subunits', now recognized to provide the most general model for cooperative (and anti-cooperative) responses in proteins. In the 1970s, he and his lab shifted to focus on understanding how cells receive and interpret signals, wisely selecting bacterial chemotaxis \u2014 the movement of bacteria in response to changes in the concentrations of certain chemicals \u2014 as a system that could be explored in exquisite detail. By rapidly changing the concentrations of the molecules that bacteria detect, Koshland demonstrated that bacterial cells have a 'memory' of their environment. In later years, members of his lab worked out much of the biochemistry of the receptor-protein methylation that underlies this process. In 1976, Koshland showed that differences between bacterial daughter cells can be caused by stochastic fluctuations inherent in systems driven by small numbers of molecules. How biology deals with such fluctuations is now a focus of research in many laboratories. In 1984, together with Albert Goldbeter, Koshland introduced the concept of 'ultrasensitivity', revealing how large differences can originate from a cascade of enzymatic reactions downstream from an initial signalling event. All this work has changed the way we think about biology; Koshland's mentorship has spawned many leaders in these fields. While maintaining an active research laboratory, Koshland became chair of the Berkeley biochemistry department in 1973 and began a series of institution-building activities across the university. In the 1980s, he drove a revolutionary reorganization of Berkeley's 200-strong biology faculty from more than ten different small departments into three large ones. This was a seemingly impossible task to those versed in university politics, but its beneficial effect on the quality of both faculty and student recruitments was immediately apparent. The recent development of biology-focused interdisciplinary science and engineering efforts at Berkeley also owes much to Koshland. In 1985, Koshland became editor-in-chief of  Science , a pivotal position for world science that he occupied, as a half-time post, for ten years. He transformed the journal, not only vastly improving the scientific research it published by appointing a cadre of talented full-time editors with PhD degrees, but also greatly increasing the quality and quantity of the sections dealing with science news and science policy. He wrote more than 200 editorials, many in the form of dialogues with 'Dr Noitall' that were testaments to both his originality and his remarkable wit. These duties did not dent his formidable scientific productivity: during his editorship, he authored more than 100 scientific articles stemming from work at his beloved Berkeley laboratory. Dan Koshland was both a model scientist and a model human being. He exemplified all the values that the idealists among us associate with science. He was completely open and honest, with a generous, happy spirit that made him a pleasure to be around. He derived great pleasure from being helpful to everyone, and he went out of his way to support young scientists. I was amazed to discover late in his life that he, a modest man who always flew in economy class and drove a dented car, was very wealthy, heir to part of the Levi Strauss fortune. In fact, Dan was a great philanthropist for science, helping to finance new buildings at Berkeley and at Haverford College in Pennsylvania, and both designing and endowing a new science museum at the National Academy of Sciences in Washington DC. I had the privilege of working closely with him in designing that museum. It is named after his first wife, Marian (Bunny) Koshland, an outstanding scientist in her own right, to whom he was married for 52 years until her death in 1997. Dan is survived by five children from that first marriage, and by his second wife, Yvonne, a former college friend whom he married in 2000. Family, friends and colleagues will come together to celebrate the breadth of his contributions to science in a memorial service and symposium at Berkeley on 16 September. Reprints and Permissions"},

Shute \u2014 The theme of \u201cOn the Beach\u201d is the extinction of the human race resulting from an atomic war. Everybody dies. Just that. When the novel opens in Melbourne, 1962, nobody is alive in the northern hemisphere. Movements of the atmosphere are steadily carrying lethal particles southwards. Mr Shute has deployed his remarkable imagination as engineer, naval officer and storyteller... On his immense popular following this book can only inflict a haunting distress: one takes off one's hat to him. Mr Shute has limited his canvas: he has taken only five main characters\u2014five very ordinary people at that; and he has pitched the emotional and dramatic tone invariably low. Until the moment when the radiation sickness comes on, everybody sticks to the tamest of domestic preoccupations; and then quietly takes a suicide pill. The effect is hypnotic and also odd. Mr Shute's world ends not, as the epigraph warns, with a whimper, but with a stoical silence, movingly impressive...The moral in so far as Mr Shute states it explicitly, comes via his characters thus: \u201cMaybe we've been too silly to deserve a world like this\u201d...

The  Challenger  was in communication with the flagship by means of wireless telegraphy the whole of her voyage.

The simplest way to show this is to charge up different pieces of insulating plastic by rubbing them on your shirt and watching what they do when brought up close to one another. Amit Mehrotra and colleagues use a similar idea to separate a mixture of red and blue sand grains falling into a hollow acrylic cylinder, purely through the different amount of charge each is carrying (A. Mehrotra  et al .  Phys. Rev. Lett.   99,  058001; 2007) . The red and blue grains were all of the same size and positively charged, with the charge density of the blue grains being about six times that of the red. The authors also made the cylinder positively charged by rubbing it lightly with nitrile gloves. The grains were mixed up on a vibratory feeder, and then discharged into the cylinder from a metal chute. On entering the cylinder, the charged grains separated spontaneously into red and blue components (pictured). Oddly, however, it was the more positively charged blue grains that moved towards the positively charged cylinder walls \u2014 rather than being more strongly repelled, as basic electrostatics would seem to demand. The authors show through simulations that the sand particles are not, in fact, going against the grain. The effect is caused by negative charges induced on the underside of the metal chute, whose concentrated attraction causes a 'beard' of falling sand grains to grow on the lip of the chute. This beard is sufficiently repulsive that the more highly charged blue grains levitate more strongly off the end of the chute, resulting in two falling streams separated according to colour. Pretty as it is, the experiment also has a practical aspect. The ability to separate grains by how much charge they carry, rather than by charge sign, could have applications in technologies that exploit electrostatic charging \u2014 aerosol drug delivery, xerography and filtration, for example.

Donald Michie was a man of many parts, irrepressible energy and great personal charisma. His first significant scientific contribution came in the field of genetics. With his second wife Anne McLaren, tragically killed in the same car accident in which he died, he published research in the 1950s that helped lay the groundwork for modern reproductive technology, and later earned him a Pioneer Award, with McLaren, from the International Embryo Transfer Society. But even while developing those ideas, he became inspired by a very different scientific passion: intelligent machines. He had first encountered this revolutionary idea in the company of Alan Turing at Britain's code-breaking centre, Bletchley Park, during the Second World War. The two did not cooperate closely, for whereas Turing was busy breaking the Enigma codes, Michie focused on using the Colossus computer to crack messages generated by the Germans' 'Tunny' teleprinter machines. They became friends nonetheless, and regularly played chess. They often discussed the possibility of intelligent machines that could play in their stead \u2014 and do mathematics, use language, interpret photographic input, learn, and even (Turing suggested) wander around the countryside unaided. This shared vision of artificial intelligence (AI) became Michie's guiding principle, and by 1948 he was writing a paper-and-pencil chess program in his spare time. As he said years later, recalling how Turing's speculations had gripped him, \u201cI resolved to make artificial intelligence my life as soon as it became feasible\u201d. He himself helped to do that, not only intellectually, but also commercially, writing the first marketable 'expert-system shell' for logic programming in the 1960s. In Britain, he founded AI virtually single-handed. His first task was to overcome what he later called \u201cthe national computer-blindness\u201d. Even Britain's science minister in the early 1960s knew nothing of the wartime code-busting efforts, and thought that 'computing' meant desk calculators. During his relentless lobbying, Michie persuaded the Royal Society to provide \u201ca few hundred pounds\u201d to enable him, with Bernard Meltzer, to set up a small AI research group at the University of Edinburgh in 1963. Its existence was made official as the Experimental Programming Unit in 1965, and in 1967 it became the Department of Machine Intelligence and Perception. Right from the start, the department received frequent visits from AI pioneers in the United States based at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Carnegie Mellon University and Stanford University. Its successor is still a leading centre in the field. Those early years were not free of problems. The initial offer of a deconsecrated church as lab space was withdrawn when Michie's intention to build an intelligent robot became known. But he remained indefatigable, and in the ensuing years fought lustily for the infant discipline, confronting academia, research councils and industry. He also did much to raise the profile of AI with the general public, holding popular lectures and penning one-off articles for the press, as well as a regular column for the trade magazine  Computer Weekly . Sometimes his optimism and enthusiasm, for instance in describing the achievements and potential of the Edinburgh robot, went too far, and prompted a backlash from sceptics and rivals. One result was the UK Science Research Council's notorious Lighthill report of 1973, which in effect pronounced research in AI to be a waste of time and money. Its criticisms were so fierce as to cause a scandal. It was the only 'internal' research-council report to be published, together with extensive rebuttals \u2014 including nine pages from Michie. The Lighthill report stalled AI research in Britain for a decade. Morale and funding reached a low ebb, with several prominent researchers fleeing to the United States. Michie was also sidelined at Edinburgh: a new Department of Artificial Intelligence was formed and inherited most of its predecessor's resources, whereas Michie was put in charge of an independent Machine Intelligence Research Unit, and forbidden to work on robotics. Research in AI was officially rehabilitated ten years later, when in 1982 Japan launched its 'Fifth Generation project', a huge financial and industrial commitment to base its future economy on AI, predicting world supremacy as a result. The response, in Britain as in the United States, was an injection of government funds into both military and civilian AI research. Michie's urbane comment was that the Lighthill incident had been a \u201cmishap of scientific politics\u201d due to all-too-human frailties \u2014 specifically, \u201cnothing but ignorance at the top\u201d. Michie's contributions to the theory of AI began in the 1960s, when a colleague had insisted that learning machines were impossible, and had challenged Michie to prove him wrong. Edinburgh still lacked a digital computer, and so Michie built \u201ca contraption of matchboxes and glass beads\u201d to master the art of noughts and crosses (tic-tac-toe). He called it the Matchbox Educable Noughts And Crosses Engine, or MENACE. He followed that in 1968 with the first reinforcement-learning program, the 'pole balancer', involving a pole balancing on a cart. This was no simulation, but controlled a real pole balanced on a real cart. In the 1970s, he capped this with research into chess endgames. Michie's pioneering Graph Traverser of the 1960s provided ideas that are now standard in heuristic search algorithms, and live on in widely used AI planning techniques. His last important contribution was his StatLog project of the early 1990s, a highly insightful comparison of various models for learning algorithms, from statistical approaches through symbolic tree-building to dynamical systems. From his long career, Donald Michie has left a generous academic legacy: the establishment of AI in Britain. That was a product of his mercurial intelligence, but those who knew him personally will also remember his wide learning, his wit and his charm. Reprints and Permissions"},

During the second half of the twentieth century, great strides were made in revealing the molecular details of oxygen-generating photosynthesis, the basis of almost all life on Earth. Horst Witt was one of the prime movers behind this revolution in understanding. Witt was born in 1922 in Bremen, Germany. From his youth he was interested in physics, and while at school he won a prestigious prize for his high-risk, and literally explosive, experiments on supersonic airfoils. On the outbreak of the Second World War, he entered the Luftwaffe, but his scientific aptitude led to his early (and lucky) release to take up research at the University of G\u00f6ttingen. He received his PhD in solid-state physics in 1950, and then moved to the Max Planck Institute of Physical Chemistry where \u2014 like several other brilliant young scientists, including Manfred Eigen \u2014 he began to explore the largely hidden beauties of the molecular life sciences. Witt chose oxygenic photosynthesis as his lifelong research topic. Inspired by the methods pioneered by George Porter and Ronald Norrish, he embarked on work with the technique of flash spectrophotometry. Using algae, in 1955 he discovered reactions of chlorophylls, carotenoids and cytochromes that occurred in microseconds. By 1961, his work, along with the independent discoveries of Lou Duysens and of Bessel Kok, led to a scheme with two photochemical reaction centres in series. At photosystem II, electrons are removed from water, generating a strong oxidant, oxygen. At photosystem I, the electrons are used to produce a strong reductant, NADPH (and thence sugars). The energy difference between the strong oxidant and the strong reductant powers all oxygen-based life. At that time the two Nobel laureates in the field, biochemist Otto Warburg and spectroscopist James Frank, were fighting their famous battles from ensconced positions. When confronted with Witt's detailed reaction scheme in 1962, Warburg mused: \u201cCould you tell us how the chemical mechanism of photosynthesis can be described on the basis of your spectroscopic observations?\u201d Witt countered with a well-aimed jibe at his eminent critic, the pioneer of oxygen detection, by observing that \u201cit would be difficult to deduce the mechanism of a combustion engine based only on sniffing the exhaust\u201d. In 1962, Witt moved to the Technical University of Berlin, where he moulded the Max-Volmer-Institute for Physical Chemistry into an internationally renowned laboratory for biophysical studies of photosynthesis. The scope of research ranged from light absorption and energy transfer to the production of redox equivalents and the synthesis of ATP, the general-purpose fuel of life. His daring ideas, and above all his extraordinary perseverance, attracted a stream of ambitious and able young scientists to work under him. During the ensuing years, this team of investigators marked off milestones in photosynthesis research. They found that excess light energy is disposed of harmlessly as heat through protective carotenoids. They discovered that the reactive pigment of photosystem II is chlorophyll  a : its cationic form extracts electrons from the active site of water oxidation, with kinetics that depends on the electrostatics of charge accumulation. And they identified plastoquinone as an electron acceptor in photosystem II, where it functions as a one-to-two electron gate and as a mobile carrier between the two photosystems. A further success was the use of electrochromic absorption transients from intrinsic photosynthetic pigments. These behave as ultra-rapid 'molecular voltmeters' to show that the primary electron-transfer reactions in both photosystems generate transmembrane voltage, and are thus directed across the photosynthetic coupling membrane. These vectorial reactions, together with associated proton uptake and release at opposite sides of the membrane, as hypothesized earlier by Peter Mitchell, were shown to generate the proton-motive force required for the synthesis of ATP. But it was the mechanism of water oxidation that remained Witt's career-long preoccupation, his  spr\u00f6de Geliebte  (prudish beloved). The manganese cluster in photosystem II is charged up with four oxidizing equivalents before it reacts with two water molecules, releasing dioxygen. Witt and his co-workers contributed valuable information on many aspects of the mechanism, including the valence changes of manganese, associated electrostatic changes and effects of extrinsic reductants. Despite these and other contributions from many laboratories around the world, understanding the detailed mechanism has remained a major challenge. Witt's early attempts to crystallize photosystem II were fruitless, and it seemed that the game would be lost to others. However, crystals of photosystem I proved to be an initial consolation. With colleagues, including his wife Ingrid, Witt fine-tuned the crystallization procedure, and in 1993 produced crystals of photosystem I diffracting to 6 \u00c5. The resolution was gradually improved to 2.5 \u00c5, revealing a beautiful trimeric structure with multiple subunits, diverse electron-transfer cofactors, about 100 chlorophyll molecules and many carotenoids, all in three-dimensional glory. In 2001, together with a team led by Wolfram Saenger, also working in Berlin, Witt and his colleagues finally succeeded in crystallizing and analysing photosystem II, with a resolution of 3.8 \u00c5. This structure was followed by the first refined model from James Barber's group, and then by the Berlin groups' further model based on slightly higher resolution. A full understanding of how photosystem II works remains one of the greatest challenges in biology. Witt received numerous awards and honours, and more than 200 publications carry his name. His co-workers and former students, many of whom remained hooked on photosynthesis research, were fascinated by his seemingly permanent youth. Indeed, instead of growing into a father to his scientific offspring, he remained the ambitious elder brother \u2014 with its mix of fraught fraternal relations from time to time, but with spark, fun and high productivity when it came to science. To those outside the inner circle, Horst Witt was a legendary figure from the early days of photosynthesis research. He had a tendency to divide members of the field into those of whom he approved (with whom he was open and charming, and relished robust argument) and those he did not: he could be intimidating. He was nevertheless universally respected for his sharp intellect and single-minded drive. Witt, who died on 14 May, leaves an unmatched legacy for those many scientists grappling with the intricacies of photosynthesis. Reprints and Permissions"},

Tony Dahlen, probably the most important theoretical geophysicist of his generation, died on 3 June 2007, in Princeton, New Jersey. His seminal research on topics as far apart as seismology, Earth's rotation and the growth of mountains exerted a lasting influence on modern geophysics. Dahlen was born in 1942 in American Falls, Idaho, while his father was serving in the US Navy in the Second World War, and moved with his reunited family to Winslow, Arizona, at the end of the war. There, in the shadow of the Barringer crater, he grew up searching for fossils and meteor fragments. Although it was a combined passion for geology, mathematics and physics, not American football, that earned him a Sloan Scholarship to the California Institute of Technology, he was nonetheless one of five members of the college football team who later became distinguished professors of geoscience. His PhD research began in 1964, working with George Backus and Freeman Gilbert at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography of the University of California, San Diego. In the wake of the wartime boom in marine geophysical research, Scripps had become one of the principal US geoscience laboratories. It was a heady time, particularly for global seismology: two huge earthquakes, in Chile in 1960 and Alaska in 1964, had excited Earth's lowest 'eigenvibrations' \u2014 modes of oscillation in which the whole planet rings like a bell, with frequencies of a few cycles per hour. Two observed oscillations, with periods of 54 and 36 minutes, showed a splitting, akin to the Zeeman effect, in which an atom's energy levels split in a magnetic field. In this instance, it is the Coriolis force \u2014 an effect of Earth's rotation \u2014 together with Earth's slightly elliptical shape, that breaks symmetry and splits the spectral line into several closely separated oscillations. Dahlen's thesis tracked the problem of the coupling of these modes. A fast worker, he could have graduated early in 1968, but decided to satisfy his broad interests by spending a further year sampling courses in other areas. In addition, in his first year at Scripps, he had caught the attention of a beautiful freshman one afternoon on the beach. She noticed he was reading a physics textbook, and asked if he would tutor her. Tony and Elisabeth Dahlen remained together until his death. In 1970, Dahlen joined the faculty at Princeton University. His early work on eigenfrequencies provided a starting point for the idea that modes of oscillation split because of anomalous structures in Earth's interior, an idea that culminated in 1979 in a celebrated paper written with John Woodhouse. This work allowed seismologists to use eigenfrequencies for seismic 'tomography', to image small variations in Earth's elastic properties that are mostly caused by temperature variations. In the same period, Dahlen made important contributions to dislocation theory, which models the deformation due to earthquakes.This work led to a seminal paper on the energy balance of earthquakes. Together with Martin Smith, Dahlen developed a linearized perturbation theory to describe the direction dependence of seismic-wave velocities in the interior of Earth. Today, this is the most practical means of visualizing the directions of the flow in Earth's mantle that is generated by convective processes. The two also determined the mantle's viscous response to stresses using the damping of a phenomenon known as the Chandler wobble, a 14-month precession of Earth's rotation. This followed on from earlier work in which Dahlen had developed a complete description of the effects of the oceans on variations in Earth's rotation. In the 1980s, Dahlen moved on to work on the mechanics of the fold-and-thrust mountain belts and accretionary wedges that form at the margins of tectonic plates as they collide with each other. Collaborating with geologists Dan Davis and John Suppe, he showed how the formation of mountains in such regions can be explained in terms of a critical taper, mechanically analogous to the wedge of soil that forms in front of a bulldozer. Calculating the energy balance of such a system in western Taiwan, he showed that internal deformation contributes comparatively little energy to rock-transformation processes. Since then, submarine wedges such as those found off the Niger delta have been shown to act similarly. He also modelled the role of erosion of mountains and showed how this dominates the thermal evolution of mountain belts \u2014 a subject of much current interest. The influential textbook  Theoretical Global Seismology  (1998), written with his former student Jeroen Tromp, marked the culmination of three decades of research by Dahlen and others into low-frequency seismic waves. By the time the book came out, however, Dahlen had shifted his attention to the higher-frequency 'body waves'. These seismic waves reveal more detailed information about features deep within Earth if sampled sufficiently densely, although the theory underlying their propagation had barely evolved since the early twentieth century. Dahlen rejected the paradigm that seismic waves propagate as narrow rays, as they do in classical optics, and he formulated an efficient computational strategy to take into account the diffraction of seismic waves. The advance allowed seismic-wave travel times to be interpreted more exactly as tomographic images. A first application by Raffaella Montelli led in 2003 to the serendipitous imaging of convecting plumes in the lower mantle \u2014 the first visual confirmation of a 30-year-old hypothesis that such plumes are the origin of ocean islands such as Tahiti and Hawaii. Dahlen was an erudite and courteous scientist, unassuming and generous towards students and colleagues alike. Seismology is evolving into a science driven by huge quantities of data, with projects such as the USArray, funded by the National Science Foundation, providing hundreds of sensors to permit the sampling of a whole wavefield, rather than arrival times of individual rays. The scale of these endeavours demands the kind of theoretical advances that Dahlen provided, and the influence of his work is likely to be felt for years to come. Although he received many honours, it is certainly the continuing relevance of his discoveries, and those of his students, that would have pleased Tony Dahlen most. Throughout his life he was driven by his love for science; his greatest pleasure was that his son Alex also decided to pursue a career in science. Reprints and Permissions"},

Delving into its complexities allows the construction of elaborate and useful structures from simple, flat templates. Saving space is an imperative in commerce, engineering and the structure of living creatures. Furniture and garden equipment come in flat-packs to save storage space in the warehouse and the delivery van \u2014 and, it must be said, to make the purchaser do all that time-consuming work of assembly. The solar panels that provide satellites with electrical power have to be folded so that they fit into the bay of a space shuttle. And who could fail to be entranced by the emergence of a butterfly from a pupa, as pulsing blood inflates bedraggled, folded tissue into glorious, gaudy wings? Over the past two decades, a dedicated band of mathematicians, engineers and computer scientists has been developing a new branch of mathematics to understand the science of folding objects flat. In a contribution 1  to a recent conference 2  that exemplifies these efforts, Taketoshi Nojima details the derivation of a surprising range of geometrical forms from a flat sheet of material, including \u201ctubes, conical shells, circular membranes, movable/shape-changeable models and highly rigid 3-D cores\u201d. Researchers' inspiration in this area derives from two quite different sources: 'biomimetics', the technological mimicry of biological processes and structures, and the ancient Japanese art of origami. The results have been intriguing and ingenious, and have already found applications in maps, food packaging, folding drinks containers, car airbags and spacecraft antennas. Among future applications could be foldable plastic bottles, lightweight skeletons for aerospace structures and compact light-sails for interplanetary travel. The mathematics developed along the way could also feed back into a better understanding of nature's own origami: the growth and development of leaves, buds and insect wings. Origami's potential as a source of mathematical problems has been recognized for some time. Its patterns of folds can construct geometric forms beyond those possible with Euclid's traditional rule and compass, such as regular seven-sided and nine-sided polygons. The basic problem of origami is the flat-folding problem: given a diagram of fold lines on a flat sheet of paper, can the paper be folded into a flat shape without introducing any further creases? In 1996, two computer scientists, Barry Hayes of Placeware, Inc. and Marshall Bern at Xerox's Palo Alto Research Center, proved that this question is mathematically equivalent to a famous problem in logic, the 3-SAT problem 3 . This is the 'satisfiability problem', and is an example of an NP-hard problem, meaning that the running time required for any algorithm to solve the problem grows rapidly as the problem becomes more complex, so that the calculation takes too long to be feasible. The satisfiability problem asks the question whether there is some assignment of values for boolean expressions \u2014 combinations of true-or-false logical statements \u2014 built from simple three-component formulas such that the entire expression returns the value 'true'. Mathematically, therefore, origami is deeper than it looks. The same is true biologically, and this is where Nojima's research comes in. By studying natural folding patterns, especially those associated with the growth of plants, he has devised methods for folding remarkable three-dimensional shapes from flat sheets of lightweight material. For example, one class of structures derives from the well-known occurrence of Fibonacci numbers (the sequence of numbers in which each is the sum of the two preceding numbers: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55 and so on) in various cylindrical or helical plants, such as pine cones and pineapples. The scales of a pine cone, for instance, form two families of helices, one twisting clockwise and the other anticlockwise. The numbers of helices in these families are two adjacent Fibonacci numbers, such as 8 and 13. Folding patterns with a similar form can be used to create rigid helical structures from flat sheets, which are rolled into a cylinder and then folded. If the sheet is first formed into a cone, collapsible conical structures can also be made ( Fig. 1 ). This idea is only the beginning. Far more elaborate shapes can also be constructed by origami methods. Often these resemble biological forms \u2014 flowers, horns, shells. Some of Nojima's patterns are inspired by the buds of the morning glory and the folds in an earwig's wings. Another source of inspiration is purely mathematical: tiling patterns, or 'tessellations', in the plane. Clever folding processes based on tessellations lead to rigid, lightweight materials of a 'honeycomb' type ( Fig. 2 ). Some of these can be stamped out from sheet metal, folded and then welded so that they retain the folded shape, providing a simple and reliable way to manufacture apparently complicated materials. The work 1  analyses the precise geometric conditions required for these constructions, putting them on a solid mathematical basis. It also pays attention to practical issues, such as the thickness of the sheet being folded. The potential of these simple but ingenious ideas is huge. Complex three-dimensional forms could arise from flat, stamped sheets of 'shape memory' materials merely by heating them. They could also be made from flat sheets of rubber and inflated, a usefully reversible construction technique. Honeycomb cores are common in the aerospace industry for their rigidity and lightness, and any new, simple manufacturing process is likely to prove valuable. Origami structures, being lightweight and compact, are 'green': they can easily be recycled, and even if they're not, the amount of rubbish they create is reduced. Nojima ends with a look to the future. He envisages the creation of a new discipline, which I am tempted to name 'origamics'. This would be a combination of engineering, mathematics and biology, and could lead to significant progress in a variety of fields. Nojima himself cites \u201cplastic buckling, biomimetic robotic modelings, movable origami modeling for education or edutainment...[and] new interpretations of bionic mechanics.\u201d He could well be right.

Study of this relationship can outline the limits to photosynthesis. Water is essential for life 'as we know it', and the search for life 'as we don't know it' elsewhere in the Universe centres on the search for evidence of water 1 . But the properties of water that make it essential for organisms and their environments can also restrict organisms' activities. An example that has now been re-investigated by Kiang  et al . 2 , 3  and by Stomp  et al . 4  is the wavelength dependence of the absorption of electromagnetic radiation by water, and also by permanent atmospheric gases. Such studies can inform our understanding of the distribution and pigmentation of photosynthetic organisms on Earth 2 , 3 , 4 , and on any life-supporting Earth-like planets in other solar systems. This biological dark side of water \u2014 its absorption of solar electromagnetic radiation \u2014 creates habitats that restrict or eliminate the roles of solar radiation in supplying energy for photosynthesis and information to sensory systems. The effective absence of solar radiation deep in large bodies of water such as lakes and oceans has long been recognized, and limits photosynthesis with this energy source to at most the top few hundred metres of water bodies, and to the land surface. The significance of water's wavelength-dependent attenuation of solar radiation for photosynthesis by aquatic organisms has been recognized since the late nineteenth century. Engelmann 5 , with his theory of complementary chromatic adaptation, suggested in 1883 that the depth at which seaweeds with different pigments grow might be related to the spectrum of incident radiation they receive. Later work showed that Engelmann had underestimated the role of dissolved and suspended material in modifying the radiation attenuation due to water alone, and that, even when this was taken into account, the quantitative significance of complementary chromatic adaptation of seaweeds in nature was small 6 . But Engelmann's perception was a great stimulus to study of the photosynthetic pigmentation and the radiation environment of organisms in relation to the absorption of radiation by water. That work has extended to anoxygenic organisms (photosynthetic bacteria) 2 , 3 , 4  \u2014 that is, those whose photosynthesis does not generate oxygen \u2014 as well as being carried out on the oxygenic organisms considered by Engelmann, and also to other planets that might support life 4 . On Earth, the advent of anoxygenic organisms preceded that of oxygenic ones. Kiang  et al . 2  surveyed the diversity of photosynthetic organisms, and propose constraints on the evolution of the pigments that harvest and transform radiation. One is the wavelength of the peak photon flux in the environment. Another is the longest wavelength that has sufficient energy per photon to bring about the appropriate photochemical reaction (in which photon energy is converted into chemical energy). Organisms that produce oxygen from water, a very energy-intensive reaction, are constrained to using shorter wavelengths than are those that do not produce oxygen. This is the case despite the oxygen producers using two photochemical reactions in series, rather than a single reaction, as seen in anoxygenic organisms. The sorts of photochemistry that can occur, and the pigmentation of the organisms, are greatly influenced by the absorption of solar radiation by water (and oxygen) in the atmosphere and, for aquatic organisms, in the water body in which they live 2 . Independent work by Stomp  et al . 4  emphasizes the photon-absorbing properties of bulk water. Their analysis concentrates on photosynthetic microorganisms living in various bodies of water whose photon-attenuation properties differ because of dissolved and suspended material. Stomp  et al . also examined the details of the photon absorption of water in the visible and infrared parts of the spectrum, concentrating on the harmonics of the molecular vibrations resulting in the main absorption features. A major outcome of this work is in defining spectral niches for photosynthetic organisms in different aquatic habitats. Such conclusions for photosynthetic microorganisms do not necessarily conflict with those of Dring 6  for seaweeds. Dring showed that the differences in pigmentation among seaweeds are less quantitatively significant for photosynthetic performance in their natural habitats than many had previously believed. Kiang and colleagues' analyses 2  of constraints on pigmentation of photosynthetic organisms on Earth provide the basis for their discussion 3  of astrobiological aspects of photosynthesis. Putative planets associated with stars of the M spectral type are commonly taken to be locations where life might occur, given the abundance of these stars and their longevity. Photosynthetic organisms on an Earth-like planet orbiting an M star would experience stellar radiation with maximum photon fluxes at wavelengths in the infrared spectrum. The 'average' photon would have a lower energy content, and there would also be a much greater absorption by water, than for solar radiation on Earth 2 , 3 , 4 , 7 . Significant photosynthesis could nonetheless occur on such a planet 4 , 7 . But there would be energetic problems in using the relatively low-energy photons to reduce carbon dioxide with electrons from water, with production of oxygen. The mechanism on Earth relies on two photochemical reactions in series; on planets orbiting an M star more than two reactions in series would be required 2 , 7 . On any such planet, the longer wavelengths at which photosynthetic pigments would absorb would have implications for the remote sensing of pigments by reflectance spectroscopy as an indicator (with appropriate caveats) of photosynthesis, and hence life. Kiang  et al . 2 , 3  and Stomp  et al . 4  use physics and chemistry to set limits on the mechanisms of photosynthesis that are possible in different habitats on Earth and on any Earth-like planets orbiting other stars. The authors' analyses outline the sorts of photosynthetic mechanism that are possible in a given radiation environment, without defining the chemical nature of the pigments or other components of the photosynthetic system. Although the evolution of oxygen-producing photosynthesis is a likely outcome of the biogeochemical changes that accompany photosynthesis not involving oxygen production on a planet, this cannot be taken for granted. Accordingly, in the search for life outside our Solar System, an astrobiological niche presents itself. This is the spectroscopic remote-sensing not only of photosynthetically produced oxygen and its derivative ozone 8 , but also of a diversity of photosynthetic pigments 3 , 7 , on any Earth-like planets that may be detected.

A simulation suggests that several familiar processes, among them gas turbulence and self-gravitation, might work together to get the job done. Making planets is tricky, and probably takes several stages. First, tiny interstellar grains must accrete into mountain-sized objects massive enough to decouple from their cocoon of nebula gas. These objects probably then combine in collisions, growing ever larger, past asteroid-sized planetesimals and lunar-sized embryos, to full-blown planets. How the first stage of this process, primary accretion, works is a fundamental unsolved problem of planetary science. On  page 1022  of this issue, Johansen  et al . 1  show how a combination of previously studied processes, acting together, might be the answer. Our understanding of how protoplanetary nebulae evolve is generally based on observations of regions where stars are forming today. But the domain near the midplane of a nebula, where large objects grow, is shrouded from observations at visual and infrared wavelengths by opaque dust at higher altitudes in the nebula. And for longer-wavelength studies, insufficient spatial resolution is a problem. Fortunately, our Solar System provides us with actual samples of primary planetesimals, in the form of primitive meteorites from asteroids and, recently, a milligram of cometary material returned by NASA's Stardust mission 2 . These planetesimals consist mainly of millimetre-sized particles \u2014 silicate 'chondrules' and higher-temperature oxides \u2014 often individually melted by intense thermal pulses in the nebula 3 . The ages of these sand-sized grains, assessed from a growing body of radioisotope data, indicate that primary accretion was an inefficient process that took between 1 million and 3 million years 4 . Over such a long period, according to models, the density, temperature and composition of the nebula would have changed profoundly 5 . Centimetre-to-metre-sized particles would also have migrated long distances, redistributing the nebula's solid component relative to its gas 6 . The mineral composition of the particles changed with their environment, and the result was the pot-pourri of meteorite classes with differing ages, structures, chemistry and isotopic content that we see today. Working backwards from today's evidence to infer the environment and physics of the primary accretion process is a fascinating challenge. Take turbulence, for instance. Tiny dust grains routinely seen floating far above the midplane of million-year-old protoplanetary disks beyond our Solar System, and crystalline silicate grains seen in abundance in cometary nuclei 2 , can be explained if nebula turbulence transports them around. But just what process can provide the energy needed to maintain turbulent gas motions, which would be quickly damped by the viscosity of the gas, remains controversial. One popular mechanism is magnetorotational instability, in which low-density, ionized nebula gas couples to ambient magnetic fields strongly enough that tiny velocity fluctuations are amplified 7 . It is unclear whether this type of turbulence can exist in the dense, neutral gas found in the inner regions of protoplanetary nebulae, but other types of instability might occur even if the nebula gas is not ionized (ref.  8  and references therein). Once a turbulent regime forms, its details are only weakly dependent on the driving process, much as was suggested by the Soviet mathematician Andrei Kolmogorov more than 60 years ago 9 . Johansen  et al . 1  construct a computational model of a nebula in which magnetorotational instability (for example) drives realistic three-dimensional turbulence. They then follow the evolution of metre-sized boulders in the model. The turbulence induces relative velocities between particles, and leads to local fluctuations in gas pressure, often on fairly large scales. These pressure fluctuations affect the local gas velocity, and determine whether particles experience a head wind (and drift inwards towards the central star) or a tail wind (and drift outwards). Particles thus accumulate in radial pressure maxima, which come and go with the evolution of large, turbulent eddies. Metre-sized particles tend to accumulate the most, as their drift rate under pressure fluctuations is the fastest. Some of these zones live long enough that the rapidly drifting, metre-sized particles can become dense enough to exceed the gas density. In this case, the particles accelerate the surrounding gas to their preferred (keplerian) orbital velocity. These dense clumps sweep up other particles, and so become ever more massive. Ultimately, some clumps become bound together by their own gravity and, presumably, remain so as the components of the clump migrate slowly towards their mutual centre of gravity and become dense rubble piles. In only a few orbit periods, the model sees large bound clumps emerging, some as massive as the largest body in the asteroid belt, the 900-kilometre-diameter Ceres. Johansen  et al . 1  are appropriately cautious about some remaining uncertainties, particularly several poorly understood 'geological' issues related to the mechanics of solids. Physical sticking is needed to create metre-sized particles initially, and inelastic collisions (in which kinetic energy is converted into other forms of energy) are needed to damp their random velocities. Sticking seems likely for small particles because they collide at very low velocities 10 . But collisional velocities in turbulence may reach tens of metres per second for metre-sized particles 11 , 12 , a value more likely to destroy the particles than to bind them together. Frequent disruption at this crucial stage would weaken the drift-concentration effect that provides the catalyst for growth in this model. Because of limited numerical resolution and uncertainties in the physical properties of realistic nebula particles, the results of this paper are preliminary in this regard, as the authors describe in their extensive online supplementary information. Both improved numerical models of the coupled dynamics of gas and particles and a better understanding of the mechanical properties of aggregates 13  are needed. The processes described by Johansen  et al . emphasize concentration of metre-sized boulders, which themselves grew merely by the sticking of smaller grains 10 . Thus, one of the longest-known aspects of primitive meteorites, their dominance by millimetre-scale particles that are highly sorted according to size 3 , is left unexplained. A different kind of concentration process has been proposed to explain how millimetre-sized particles can be concentrated into dense zones in the nebula 12 , but so far only qualitative ideas of how planetesimals might grow out of these zones have been advanced. The answer could be that some combination of processes, each selecting a different particle size, acts simultaneously or sequentially, possibly in turbulent conditions. (Of course, the mechanism by which turbulence is maintained remains uncertain.) Whatever the final answer turns out to be, the results of Johansen and colleagues 1  indicate that future efforts devoted to developing more complex models of the interactions between particles and gas in the protoplanetary nebula will be a good investment.

In the three years since then, the spacecraft has provided snapshots of the strange and fascinating worlds that inhabit the Saturn system: the eerily Earth-like Titan, for instance, the rain on whose plains is mainly methane; or Enceladus, from near whose 'tiger-striped' southern pole an icy plume spouts into space. No moon, however, seems quite as odd as the body that hove into Cassini's close view on 25 September 2005. Irregularly shaped and chaotically rotating, Hyperion, the eighth-largest saturnian moon, looks for all the world like a bathroom sponge. Two papers in this issue take a detailed look at this odd character. In the first of these, Thomas  et al . (P. C. Thomas  et al .  Nature   448 , 50\u201353; 2007) conclude that Hyperion's sponge-like appearance (Fig. 1 on  page 51 ) comes from an unusually high density of well-preserved craters between 2 and 10 kilometres across. According to the authors' theory, these discrete craters survived, rather than having been eroded away or filled in by material ejected in the impacts that formed them, because Hyperion's interior is indeed porous. A meteorite hitting a significantly porous body will compress its surface rather than excavate it, and produce much less ejected material. The authors arrive at this explanation by first calculating Hyperion's mean radius \u2014 no mean feat, as its irregular shape and random spinning make imaging it in one shot impossible. They were also able to compute the moon's mass through a dynamical model requiring that Hyperion maintain a stable orbit in the complex gravitational environment of the Saturn system. This mass was only just over half that expected for a body of Hyperion's 135-km calculated mean radius, if it were made of water ice \u2014 and considerably less if higher-density materials are present. In other words, there is far less within Hyperion than had been expected. In the second of the papers, Cruikshank  et al . (D. P. Cruikshank  et al .  Nature   448 , 54\u201356; 2007) delve more deeply into Hyperion's make-up. Using data from ultraviolet and infrared spectrometers onboard Cassini, they divide the moon's surface into distinct areas of high reflectivity, seemingly dominated by water ice, and low reflectivity, concentrated at the craters' bases. These latter areas have a considerably diminished water-ice signature, but a prominent absorption band best explained by the presence of solid carbon dioxide in complex with a further, unknown material. Hyperion's spectra, like those of other saturnian satellites such as Phoebe and Iapetus, also provide evidence for irregularly scattered, nitrogen-rich, organic molecules. The image shown here of three surveys overlaid on the moon's surface topography (blue, H 2 O; red, CO 2 ; green, carbon nitrides, CN) gives an idea of the complexity of the picture. Cyan indicates areas with strong H 2 O and CN signals, but little CO 2 ; yellow areas are dominated by CO 2  and CN, with little H 2 O; and magenta equates to CO 2  and H 2 O, but little organic material. What these discoveries tell us of Hyperion's origin and the wider history of the Saturn system is as yet unclear. But as the pictures from Cassini continue to roll in, the varied worlds they depict do not cease to surprise. Reprints and Permissions"},

A personal example: Picasso painting white lines on glass using large strokes, filmed behind the glass by Clouzot. Everything that I tried painting laboriously later was born from such glimpses.\u201d (Pierre-Gilles de Gennes, from  L'\u00e9merveillement  by Thibaut de Wurstemberger, Saint-Augustin, 1998.) With his strikingly simple yet pioneering ideas, Pierre-Gilles de Gennes drew 'white lines in large strokes' that defined the physics of soft matter \u2014 liquid crystals, polymers, colloids and surfactants. He died on 18 May. Educated at the \u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure in Paris during 1951\u201355, de Gennes learned theoretical physics from the greatest masters of his time. He obtained his PhD in 1957 while at the French Atomic Energy Commission, specializing in magnetism and neutron scattering. During a stay at the University of California, Berkeley, in 1959 he studied with the solid-state physicist Charles Kittel, who taught him how to communicate ideas in physics using plain language, so avoiding the use of daunting equations. After two years in the French navy, de Gennes founded a research group at the University of Paris, Orsay, in 1961. Working on superconductivity, he became a self-proclaimed \u201ctheoretician of the tangible\u201d \u2014 a theoretical physicist who works closely with experimentalists. But it was in 1967 that he started on work in the area that made him famous, creating the Orsay Liquid Crystals Group. Assembling a group of specialists from the fields of optics, crystallography and magnetism, along with theoreticians, he formed a truly multidisciplinary team. De Gennes fostered a collective research effort that is scarcely imaginable today. Papers were signed not with the names of individuals, but with the name of the group. Theoreticians would spend half their time contemplating liquid crystals under the microscope and discussing practical experiments. Researchers would often arrive in the morning to find a note from de Gennes that would launch them in yet another ground-breaking direction. Calling on his vast knowledge of physics, de Gennes drew analogies between different fields. For example, he realized that laws developed to describe superconductivity phenomena could be used to understand phase transitions in liquid crystals. His nomination to the prestigious Coll\u00e8ge de France in 1971 coincided with the end of his liquid-crystal research and the beginning of his work on polymers. Over the next three decades, de Gennes gave a series of public lectures on a different subject each year \u2014 colloids, granular matter and adhesion, to name just a few. While lecturing on phase transitions, de Gennes discovered the analogy between the conformations of polymer chains and the alignment of magnetic moments at a magnetic phase transition. This so-called ' n  = 0' theorem turned polymer physics upside-down, allowing theories of phase transitions to be applied to polymers and earning him the Nobel prize in 1991. De Gennes was a proponent of the idea that diverse phenomena could be analysed with scaling arguments \u2014 that problems could be simplified by invoking a characteristic time and length scale. This approach helps get to the heart of a problem and guides experiments. During this period, he started to use images to explain his ideas, and found creative language to describe these images. Each theory based on scaling arguments became the subject of a drawing. For instance, he likened a polymer solution to a fishing-net and called the mesh a 'blob'. If our focus zooms in on a blob, we see the characteristic behaviour of an isolated polymer chain. But if the perspective zooms out sufficiently, we find another limit, that of the entangled polymer chains, which are composed of strings of independent blobs. The concept of blobs allows both the statics (equilibrium behaviour) and dynamics of polymer solutions to be calculated. Another example is de Gennes' description of polymers adsorbed onto liquid\u2013air or liquid\u2013solid interfaces: he drew a fractal grid that allowed the theoretical concentration profile to be solved in a single line. Finally, his 'reptation' model describes how a polymer chain can snake through a tube formed by surrounding molecules. In this way, the viscoelastic properties of polymer melts can be described by a few simple equations. In 1980, de Gennes turned his attention to the science of colloids and wetting, collaborating closely with industry. Intrigued by the process of assisted oil recovery \u2014 in which polymers or surfactants are injected into oilfields to aid the flow of oil \u2014 he plunged into the physics of wetting. By devising numerous \u201ceasy experiments\u201d (as he put it), de Gennes elucidated the spreading dynamics of drops on surfaces; the wetting behaviour of films; and the laws that govern aquaplaning by cars. The final phase of de Gennes' career began in 2002, when he joined the Curie Institute in Paris. Here he studied two topics at the forefront of biology: cellular adhesion and memory formation. He took the same approach to biology as he had to industry \u2014 faced with problems of apparently insurmountable complexity, he isolated the few essential parameters to derive minimalist theories that could be used and tested. De Gennes pursued his research with extraordinary imagination, insatiable curiosity and an ability to grasp facts rapidly. But he also gave his time to others and helped them develop their ideas. A keen ambassador of science to the public, he generated passionate debates on subjects as diverse as \u201cPhysics and Medicine\u201d, \u201cInventors\u201d and \u201cPrimo Levi\u201d. He inspired generations of students to pursue careers in physics and played an active role in establishing the L'Or\u00e9al\u2013UNESCO Awards for Women in Science. Pierre-Gilles de Gennes leaves seven children, three born to Anne-Marie de Gennes and four born to me. His scientific legacy is the enduring stamp he has left on intellectual life in France and internationally on the study of the physics of so many diverse phenomena.

The Bradley stars, numbering about 2600, are mainly stars visible to the naked eye; they cover nearly three-quarters of the celestial sphere, and throughout the whole of this area Prof. Kapteyn found the two streams prevailing, and it seemed probable that all the stars he examined belonged to one or other of the two streams... In conclusion, whilst Prof. Kapteyn's theory accounts in a simple manner for the very anomalous and unsymmetrical way in which the directions of motion of the stars are distributed, it is still awaiting the verdict of the spectroscopic determinations of line-of-sight velocities.

Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA  doi:10.1073/pnas.0701248104). They provide a strong case that the aristolochic acid produced by  A. clematitis  is the cause of endemic (Balkan) nephropathy. This disease results in kidney failure and is associated with cancer of the upper urinary tract. Its name stems from its incidence in farming communities along tributaries of the Danube. Here, as Grollman  et al . confirmed in their early work done in Croatia, the plant grows in wheat fields and its seeds become mixed with wheat grains during harvesting \u2014 and so can contaminate the flour that is subsequently baked into bread. The authors' investigations were prompted by similarities between endemic nephropathy and a condition called aristolochic acid nephropathy, which was identified in a group of women in Belgium and attributed to their use of herbal products as part of a slimming regime. Aristolochic acid reacts with DNA, and forms tell-tale biomarkers that can be used as indicators of exposure to the substance. These biomarkers indeed turned out to be present in Croatian patients with endemic nephropathy, and malignancies of the upper urinary tract, who had long inhabited villages likely to be subject to dietary contamination. They were not seen in patients with other types of kidney disease. Grollman  et al . then went further, delving into the mutational background of the cancers. They focused on the tumour-suppressor protein p53, which helps protect the genome against damage. Here they identified a large proportion of switches of the adenine\u2013thymine nucleotide coupling in DNA to thymine\u2013adenine. This mutational 'fingerprint' is also seen in cultured cells and in rodents treated with aristolochic acid. All in all, the authors' detective work provides enough evidence to put  A. clematitis  in the dock, if not to allow an outright conviction. Other causes of endemic nephropathy have been considered over the years, including one that echoes the notorious case of ergotism. This disorder was eventually attributed to the action of toxins produced by fungal infection of cereals. A fungal toxin, ochratoxin A, has likewise been proposed as the agent behind endemic nephropathy, but the authors find the case for that to be weak.

They conclude, then, that there must be a large genetic component to susceptibility, and investigations of that aspect will shortly be under way. Reprints and Permissions"},

Against expectations, astronomers have identified an old, oxygen-rich star that can also synthesize a chemically varied molecular cocktail. For 30 years, astronomers' favourite star in the search for molecules was a nearby, old, carbon-rich star called CW Leo. This star produces such a variety of molecules that it constitutes a veritable 'molecular factory'. On  page 1094  of this issue, Ziurys  et al . 1  describe how they have discovered another stellar molecular factory that is almost as prolific.VY Canis Majoris (VY CMa) is a cool, old star like CW Leo, and like CW Leo it is in our Galactic neighbourhood. But it is different in one crucial respect: it is rich in oxygen. Apparently, then, oxygen-rich stars can also produce a wide variety of molecules when they are near the ends of their lives. Most people think of stars as sources of light. But since the early 1970s, and the development of infrared and microwave astronomy, stars have also proved to be sources of matter. We now know that old stars generate strong stellar winds that eject material from the parent star into interstellar space. Because many heavy elements are synthesized by nuclear processes in the interior of old stars, stellar winds are a major avenue for feeding those elements into the interstellar medium. What kinds of matter are in the stellar winds? In addition to atomic nuclei, it turns out that the stellar winds have very rich chemical contents. Spectroscopic observations at millimetre and submillimetre wavelengths have resulted in the detection of more than 60 types of molecule. These include inorganic molecules (for example, CO, SiO, SiS, NH 3 , AlCl), organic molecules (C 2 H 2 , CH 4 , H 2 CO, CH 3 CN), radicals (CN, C 2 H, C 3 , HCO + ), rings (C 3 H 2 ) and chains (HC 5 N, HC 7 N) 2 . The winds are dispersing fast, so the formation processes must take place on timescales as short as hundreds of years. Conventional wisdom suggests that if oxygen is more abundant than carbon, most of the carbon atoms in the wind of VY CMa should be locked up in the CO molecule, a simple and stable molecular species that forms in the atmosphere of the star. Given the lack of available carbon atoms, an oxygen-rich star is not expected to have the chemical versatility of a carbon-rich star and is therefore much less likely to have a chemically rich molecular content. So it comes as a surprise that Ziurys  et al . 1  announce seven newly discovered molecules in the stellar wind of VY CMa. Not only is the production of these increased numbers of molecules a feat in itself 1 , but the variety of molecules is striking as well. Among the seven are molecules containing sulphur (NS), phosphorus (PN), silicon (SiS) and even metals (NaCl, or salt). Phosphorus is of particular interest because this element has an essential role in the biochemistry of life, in spite of its low abundance in the cosmos. The authors' discovery also reveals unexpected physical complexity. They found the molecular ion HCO + , even though it is not expected to be present in the low-temperature, neutral environment of a cool star. The molecules in VY CMa were identified through their rotational transitions. When a molecule decays to a lower rotational state, having been excited by collisions or radiation to a higher rotational state, it emits microwaves at specific wavelengths. Modern spectrometers can have high spectral resolution, so different molecular species can be uniquely identified by the wavelengths of the observed spectral lines. Because the observed line wavelengths are shifted by the velocities of the emitting gas, as a result of the Doppler effect, Ziurys  et al . were also able to derive the kinematic structures of the different components of the winds from the emission profiles of lines. Imaging of VY CMa by the Hubble Space Telescope has shown that the winds have complicated morphologies ( Fig. 1 ), and the origin of the different molecules can be traced to different morphological features 3 . So these observations can also be used as probes to help elucidate the physics of the winds. Our interest in old stars is not confined to the molecules they may be producing. In the gas phase, molecules are in turn believed to be the building-blocks of more complex inorganic and organic solids that consist of hundreds of atoms. These solids have been detected by infrared spectroscopy through their vibrational modes. Planetary nebulae, the descendants of old red-giant stars such as CW Leo, have been seen to contain carbonaceous compounds with both ring and chain structures typical of complex organic substances 4 . The detection of additional gas-phase molecules will help us draw a more complete picture of chemical synthesis in stars. Ziurys and colleagues' report 1  shows that there is much more to be learnt about the use of old stars as laboratories for studying interstellar chemistry. How do these stars manage to make complex molecules in the extreme low-density environment? Do physical shocks, radiation or even grain-surface chemistry contribute to the molecular-formation process? What chemical pathways lead from the simple gas-phase molecules to complex organic solids? And what roles do these molecules have in the enrichment of the Galaxy and maybe even the early Solar System? Such questions have broad implications beyond astronomy and chemistry \u2014 winds from old stars will be an enticing target of observations for some time to come. Reprints and Permissions"},

Bohdan Paczy\u0144ski, one of the most brilliant astrophysicists of the twentieth century, died on 19 April 2007. Paczy\u0144ski had an uncanny ability to see to the heart of complex astronomical phenomena, quickly identifying the essential physical processes. He performed this trick again and again, amply demonstrating that what he (with characteristic self-deprecation) called \u201ccommon sense\u201d was uncommon indeed. Paczy\u0144ski was born on 8 February 1940 in Wilno, Poland (now Vilnius, Lithuania). He was interested in astronomy from an early age, and as a teenager made many visual observations with a 25-centimetre refractor telescope to time the light minima of eclipsing binary stars. He went on to study physics at the University of Warsaw, receiving his PhD in 1964, after which he was based at the Copernicus Astronomical Center in Warsaw. During the 1960s and through to the early 1980s, he was frequently invited to the West, and during one such visit \u2014 in December 1981 \u2014 martial law was declared in Poland. Paczy\u0144ski chose to remain in the United States. In 1982 he was appointed to a professorship at Princeton University, where he spent the rest of his career. Unlike our Sun, some stars vary considerably in their luminosity. To understand variable stars, Paczy\u0144ski undertook pioneering studies on stellar structure and evolution; on the physics of the accretion disks of material that orbit many celestial bodies, and that mediate mass transfer in certain binary star systems; and on the evolutionary effects of this mass transfer. By 1967 he had published a series of theoretical papers on the evolution of close binary stars, and was recognized as a leading authority in this field. Among his contributions were the first recognition that gravitational radiation influences the evolution of very tight binaries, and that there is a close relationship between the luminosity of a giant star and the mass of its degenerate core of helium 'ash'. The Paczy\u0144ski code for stellar evolution, one of the earliest examples of open-source scientific software, set a standard for the generous dissemination of research tools. Paczy\u0144ski was a leader in the field of gravitational lensing: the phenomenon whereby light from a source is bent by the gravity of an intervening body, such as a galaxy. His early papers on lensing by quasars and elliptical galaxies preceded the first observation of gravitational lensing by four years. In 1986, he proposed that modern electronic detectors and computers could be used to search for rare gravitational 'microlensing' by stars or other compact masses in our own Galaxy. Although many astronomers thought this proposal wildly ambitious, his paper stimulated several groups \u2014 including his own Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE) team \u2014 to design and build suitable camera systems. This equipment allowed the observation in the 1990s of microlensing of stars in our Galaxy's central bulge. The OGLE team has since detected thousands of microlensing events, providing strong evidence that ordinary matter dominates 'dark matter' in the Galactic bulge. With Shude Mao, a graduate student, Paczy\u0144ski went on to show that stellar companions, including planets, could have distinctive effects on microlensing light curves, allowing the mass and location of the companion to be determined. This paper led to the discovery of several extrasolar planets, including the first detection of an Earth-like planet. In 1987, Paczy\u0144ski was the first to suggest that 'giant luminous arcs' in two clusters of galaxies were in fact images of background galaxies, magnified and distorted by the gravitational field of the lensing cluster. Such cluster lens systems have since been used to observe distant galaxies that would otherwise be too faint to study, and the method provides an independent estimate of the masses of the clusters. Paczy\u0144ski also profoundly influenced the study of cosmic \u03b3-ray bursts (GRBs) \u2014 hugely energetic flashes of \u03b3-rays that are often followed by 'afterglows' at longer wavelengths. In 1986, he pointed out that observed GRBs had properties consistent with their being at cosmological distances, contradicting the prevailing view that GRBs originate on neutron stars within our Galaxy. Argument over the Galactic or cosmological origin of GRBs was heated, culminating in a public debate in Washington DC in April 1995 between Paczy\u0144ski and Donald Lamb, moderated by Martin Rees. Within two years, Paczy\u0144ski's position was vindicated by observations of GRB afterglows, with absorption lines from intervening galaxies proving them to be at cosmological distances. Variable stars, dwarf novae, novae, supernovae, GRBs \u2014 Paczy\u0144ski was interested in, and delighted by, all cosmic phenomena and all of astrophysics. He suspected that there might be new kinds of as-yet undiscovered celestial events. He understood that small telescopes had the potential to discover rare transient events, and with that in mind was responsible for the creation of the All Sky Automated Survey to systematically monitor an area of the sky containing tens of millions of stars. Paczy\u0144ski was always open to the possibility that fashionable models might be incorrect, and stressed the value of applying simple geometric or astronomical arguments whenever possible. His originality, coupled with his profound understanding of stars, gravitational lensing and, indeed, the essentials of all astrophysics, made him a unique source of new ideas. His achievements were recognized worldwide, and he received many honours, including the highest awards of the American Astronomical Society and the Royal Astronomical Society. Bohdan Paczy\u0144ski approached life with zest and good humour. One of his daily pleasures was discussing with his colleagues the latest preprints at morning coffee. He was very generous with his ideas; many a paper closes with thanks to Paczy\u0144ski for valuable suggestions. During the last four years of his life he battled brain cancer with courage and good cheer, continuing to do science to his last days. The world has lost a great scientist, and a wonderful man.

Grant"}], "parsed_as_year": "2006_or_before", "body": "Physicist, engineer and leader in the development of nuclear power. Chauncey Starr \u2014 veteran of the Manhattan District Project, pioneer of the peaceful uses of atomic energy and founder of EPRI, the Electric Power Research Institute \u2014 died on 17 April. The previous day, we had held a celebration of his recent 95th birthday at EPRI, with Chauncey holding forth on his life experiences and lessons learned. He was in fine fettle. The following morning, before leaving for his office at EPRI, as he had been doing ever since his official retirement 30 years previously, he took his usual short nap after breakfast. But this time, he didn't wake up. It is hard to conceive of a more graceful way to end a long and fulfilling career. Starr was born in Newark, New Jersey, the second son of Jewish\u2013Russian immigrants. Educated in the local public-school system, he went on to earn degrees in engineering and physics at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, New York. His 1935 PhD thesis examined the thermal and electrical properties of rectifying copper-oxide junctions. I used to kid him that if he had accidentally introduced some calcium impurities into his samples, he might have discovered today's family of high-temperature cuprate superconductors. He then joined Percy Bridgman's group at Harvard University to work on the thermal transport properties of metals at high pressure. This is one of the most difficult of condensed-matter experiments to carry out, given the confounding background of containment vessel and thermometry. Starr, however, devised a differential method that could much more accurately determine the thermal diffusivity (thermal conductivity and specific heat) of metals in such a situation. This was an especially notable advance at the time: Bridgman had published work suggesting that the Wiedemann\u2013Franz law, which links the thermal and electrical conductivities of metals, and was one of the lynchpins of the then emerging quantum theory of solids, may not apply to metals under pressure. With his new technique, Starr was able to show that this conclusion resulted from systematic errors in Bridgman's previous experiments. To claim that he saved Bridgman from not receiving his future Nobel prize may be a stretch, but he certainly rescued his boss from major embarrassment. Twenty-five years later, in 1962, I undertook my doctoral work in that same group at Harvard. At that time, several of my fellow students were still using the methods Starr had pioneered. From Harvard, Starr went on to a postgraduate position in the Magnet Lab at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he added cryogenics and magnetic measurements to his portfolio of experimental skills. In 1940, he took a post with the US Navy's Bureau of Mines, leading a group of engineers analysing pressure-wave propagation from mine explosions and exploring the effects of these waves on various hull geometries. Immediately after Pearl Harbor, he and a colleague tried to enlist in the army, but were told that what they were doing would be a greater contribution to the war effort than fighting in foxholes. Word of Starr's technical and leadership skills spread throughout the then small community of American physicists, and in 1942 he was invited to join the staff of E. O. Lawrence at the University of California Radiation Laboratory at Berkeley. Lawrence's intention (largely unknown to Starr at the time) was to train him in the principles of cyclotron resonance for eventual reassignment to the 'calutron' or 'racetrack' uranium-235 separation project at Oak Ridge, Tennessee, which at the time was not reaching its production goals. Lawrence asked Starr to form and lead a team of several hundred engineers, to troubleshoot the early-production calutrons through experiments performed on a small-scale model he was to construct. The ensuing improvements were incorporated into new production machines, and by the spring of 1945 sufficient  235 U had been separated to provide the critical mass for a weapon. Many years later, Starr and Floyd Culler, wartime chief of chemical physics at Oak Ridge, were in my office reminiscing about the days when they watched their technicians use tweezers to pick apart flakes of  235 U, embedded in halide impurities, for shipment to Los Alamos and assembly into the Little Boy bomb. The hair on the back of my neck quite literally stood up. On the morning of 6 August 1945, when the uranium atoms in those flakes split in the sky over Hiroshima, my father was stationed with the US Navy in Manila Bay in the Philippines. Starr was convinced that the decision by President Truman to use atomic weapons against Japan was correct, making invasion unnecessary and thus saving the lives of countless Japanese and Allied servicemen that would otherwise have been sacrificed. Maybe my Dad would have been among them. After the war, Starr transferred to the Clinton Lab at Oak Ridge to participate in the design work on reactors for nuclear power led by Eugene Wigner and Alvin Weinberg. In 1946, he was hired by North American Aviation to initiate their nuclear programme, later forming and becoming president of a new division of the company, Atomics International. There, in collaboration with Wally Zinn at Argonne National Lab in Illinois, he pioneered the application of atomic energy to the generation of electricity. It was this that he considered his most important contribution to the world. In 1966, he left the power-reactor industry to become dean of engineering at the University of California, Los Angeles, before moving on, six years later, to found EPRI under contract from the US electric utility industry. In the first of these jobs, he made pioneering contributions to the academic discipline of risk analysis. In the second, among other achievements, he stood firm to establish an environmental division at EPRI despite the vigorous opposition of a number of utility executives, who simply wanted to ignore issues such as the acid rain caused by emissions from power plants using fossil fuels. For his accomplishments, Chauncey Starr received numerous awards \u2014 including honorary degrees, membership of national and international academies, and medals from heads of state. But I know that the recognition he found most personally satisfying came near the end of his life: he was able to witness the rebirth of interest in nuclear power in the United States, the fruit of his younger days, which had lain dormant for so many years.

His eyes rest on an innocent-looking woman in a simple dress adorned with a single pale stone. Has he recognized that the stone is the key to all the information that is holding his adversary's evil organization together? Yuko Ishii  et al . would have recognized this hidden device. They have developed a holographic information storage system in which a piece of the mineral ulexite is a key component (Y. Ishii  et al .  Opt. Express   15,  7218\u20137223; 2007 ). As each stone is unique and irreproducible, only the stone that is used to store the information can retrieve it again. In holographic memory, information is stored optically in a light-sensitive crystal. An 'object' laser beam (containing information) produces an interference pattern with a reference beam, and the pattern is inscribed on the crystal. Information is retrieved again by using a third beam, in combination with the reference laser. The beauty of the technique is that multiple images can be stored in the same volume, by slightly changing the settings of the reference beam at each recording step. Although it cannot yet beat magnetic disks in terms of price and performance, holographic data storage has its own advantages, and could become more competitive if its storage capacity could be improved. One way to achieve this is to use random reference beams, which can be generated by randomly rotating a diffuser in front of the reference laser. But this requires a computer-controlled rotator and an algorithm to impose the randomness. Ishii and colleagues' approach is much simpler and more compact. They use a piece of ulexite as the diffuser and rotate it in regular steps. Because each piece of mineral has a unique composition, the random pattern of reference beams produced cannot be replicated by any other stone. Furthermore, only that stone can be used to retrieve the data. Ishii  et al . demonstrate the effectiveness of the scheme by holographically storing images of a running figure and retrieving them as an animation with six frames per second (see figure). The authors note that the stone could be worn as part of an accessory and so be carried without attracting suspicion \u2014 except, that is, from a secret agent who has kept up with the scientific literature.

Researchers studying glaciers and earthquakes have for some time followed this principle, exploiting the power of satellite interferometric imaging to map surface displacements down to the centimetre scale. Doug Alsdorf and his colleagues have taken the same approach in their investigations of the periodic floods that occur in the Amazon basin (D. Alsdorf  et al .  Geophys. Res. Lett.   34 , doi:10.1029/2007GL029447; 2007). The Amazon river has an intimate relationship with its vast floodplain, with an estimated 25% of its average annual discharge flowing and ebbing across it. But very little is known about the behaviour of these floods: not least, gauges of water level are placed only along the main channels, and then only sparsely. There are technical difficulties in taking interferometric measurements of water surfaces with satellite-borne synthetic-aperture radar. But flooded vegetation (pictured) does reflect an adequate signal. Using data provided by instruments aboard the Japanese Earth Resources Satellite, Alsdorf  et al . have been able to map the spatial and temporal complexity of floodplain inundation. Their study of floods from three different years takes in an area of the central Amazon basin that includes flows from the Purus river, as well as the Amazon itself. Water levels in the floods, it turns out, do not take on the pattern that might be expected from a simple correspondence with the levels in the main channel of the river. Rather, there is a complicated interplay in which flow paths and water levels are influenced not only by the main channel and floodplain topography, but also by local and far-reaching hydraulic factors created by the flood itself. These are proof-of-principle findings, with a practical edge. Modelling of floods is bedevilled by a lack of relevant measurements to test them. Satellite data can help redress that lack, with the ultimate aim of guiding engineering or other solutions to the inundation of areas inhabited by human populations. Furthermore, periodic flooding, and the associated delivery of sediments and nutrients, is a natural feature of wetland ecosystems not only in the Amazon but throughout the world. Some wetlands are under threat and, in some, restoration projects are in hand. Clarification of the relevant networks of water flow in different circumstances would offer another approach to ensuring the long-term success of such projects. Reprints and Permissions"},

Gerlt"}], "parsed_as_year": "2006_or_before", "body": "Pioneering chemist at the interface with biology. Today, we recognize that the complexities of biology can be explained by understanding the chemical and physical properties of the molecules, both large and small, that interact to mediate life's processes. However, we should never forget the intellectual foundation that allows us to approach difficult biological problems in this way. Frank Westheimer, who died on 14 April at the age of 95, demonstrated that chemists have a unique advantage in deciphering the key processes of biology. Westheimer used his insight to describe the workings of enzyme-catalysed reactions, providing essential blueprints for future investigations of the biochemical foundations of life. Westheimer was born in Baltimore, Maryland, on 15 January 1912. He graduated from Dartmouth College in 1932 and received his PhD in chemistry from Harvard University in 1935. Following a postdoctoral year at Columbia University, he joined the chemistry department at the University of Chicago, where he worked for nearly 20 years. However, this period was interrupted by the Second World War, when he was a supervisor at the National Explosives Research Laboratory. In 1953, he returned to Harvard, where he remained until his retirement in 1983. He received the US National Medal of Science in 1986. Westheimer began his career as a physical organic chemist, and one of his most notable achievements in this area was the invention of molecular mechanics in the late 1940s. This is a mathematical approach in which the bending and stretching parameters of molecules are used to predict the rates of chemical reactions. The manual calculation efforts required were considerable, but molecular mechanics (and its sibling, quantum mechanics) is now used routinely as a computational method to predict the course of enzyme-catalysed reactions. While at Chicago, Westheimer started working in biochemistry; he was the first to apply the rigorous analysis of physical organic chemistry to enzymes. Because he chose not to focus on a single problem, it is difficult to identify an area of biochemistry that Westheimer has not influenced. His first breakthrough was in the early 1950s, when he used isotopic labelling to study the oxidation of alcohol (ethanol) by the enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase. He discovered that a direct transfer of hydrogen occurs between the substrate and the enzyme cofactor \u2014 a then surprising result that demonstrated the power of his chemical approach. Today, this study could be simply performed using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. But NMR wasn't available at the time, so Westheimer's analyses were accomplished by 'brute force': the organic molecules were combusted to produce water, which was converted to hydrogen gas. The isotopic content of that gas was then determined by mass spectrometry. Westheimer also demonstrated that this enzymatic hydrogen transfer is stereospecific \u2014 the active site distinguishes between two chemically equivalent hydrogens in ethanol, transferring just one of them to the cofactor. Nowadays, it is understood that chemically equivalent hydrogen atoms in molecules can be differentiated in the chiral environment of an enzyme active site. But Westheimer's study was the first demonstration of this effect, and his results were unexpected. Shortly after moving to Harvard, Westheimer went on to investigate another important class of biochemical transformation: phosphoryl transfer reactions. These are essential for many biological processes, including the production and use of metabolic energy, the storage of genetic information, and signal transduction. The central chemical event in these processes is the cleavage of bonds in phosphate ester molecules, which come in two varieties: monoesters (as found in the energy-storage molecule ATP) and diesters (such as those found in DNA). Westheimer established that the mechanisms of cleavage in phosphate diesters and monoesters are not the same, so providing a crucial understanding of how enzymes catalyse these diverse reactions. With typical eclecticism, Westheimer made another ground-breaking discovery in the 1960s by determining how enzyme active sites stabilize carbanions \u2014 unstable organic anions that often occur as intermediates in enzyme-catalysed processes. Focusing on the reaction mediated by the acetoacetate decarboxylase enzyme, he showed that the carbanion intermediate is stabilized by a positively charged group (a \u03b2-iminium ion) that forms when the substrate reacts with a lysine amino acid side chain in the active site. He also established the importance of electrostatic effects in modulating the reactivities of chemical groups in active sites. In the case of acetoacetate decarboxylase, the active-site environment decreases the basicity of the essential lysine residue, a necessary effect if the enzyme is to work at neutral pH. Westheimer continued to be intrigued by the cleavage of phosphate esters, and I joined his laboratory as a graduate student in the early 1970s as part of his research effort in that area. One day, I realized that I had inadvertently crystallized a crucial enzyme, so I asked Frank to come with me from his office to the microscope in the laboratory. Despite protestations that he was busy, he followed me, and I will never forget his smile when I told him what he was looking at. To a chemist, crystals are both measures of purity and objects of beauty. To Frank, crystals of a molecule as complex as an enzyme were a special joy. Westheimer's achievements extended beyond academia. In 1965, he chaired the US National Academy of Sciences Committee for the Survey of Chemistry. This body issued the influential Westheimer Report, which recommended increases in US federal funding for the chemical sciences and highlighted the importance of the emerging field of biochemistry. Westheimer also served as a science adviser to US President Lyndon Johnson from 1967 to 1970. I last saw Frank three years ago at his home in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Even at 92, he was intensely interested in my science, just as he had been when I was a graduate student. My plan was to give a private seminar about my most recent work, but I didn't get far before he was reminiscing about his career and how science had changed. As he observed in my work, X-ray crystallography is now used routinely to obtain enzyme structures, providing once unimaginable information for determining their modes of action. It was humbling to recall that his pioneering work on alcohol dehydrogenase was achieved without even the benefit of NMR. But although experimental tools have changed, the intellectual guidelines established by Westheimer for understanding the chemical basis of biology will endure for ever. Reprints and Permissions"},

Fernandez and Molly R. Morris have revisited a question that evolutionary biologists just can't let go of. Many species of primate have trichromatic colour vision. But what factors drove its evolution? The authors have tested the 'pre-existing-bias hypothesis' ( Am. Nat.  doi:10.1086/518566; 2007). This holds that the evolution of a trait such as colour vision might have evolved to meet one particular need, but was subsequently favoured by selection for another. A long-standing idea is that trichromatic vision is of great benefit in foraging \u2014 in allowing red or orange food items to be seen more easily in green foliage. Another is that its genesis lies in promoting sexual selection \u2014 that intense colour, in particular red as skin or fur coloration, evolved for example as a signal of sexual state or prowess. Fernandez and Morris set out to provide a statistical test of the possibility that selection of this latter putative function was due to a pre-existing bias. Their approach was to mine the literature to produce 'ancestral state reconstructions' of the incidence among primate groups of colour vision, fur colour, skin colour and form of mating system. The thinking behind the inclusion of this last characteristic was that selection for colourful signals is likely to be greater in gregarious species. These reconstructions were then subjected to tests of whether red fur and skin were more likely to have evolved in the presence of colour vision and gregarious mating systems. The conclusion that emerges is that trichromatism preceded a tendency towards red coloration and gregarious mating systems \u2014 that is, that there was indeed a pre-existing bias towards red (probably, think the authors, for more efficient foraging) that then prompted the coevolution of red skin and fur through sexual selection. There are obviously plenty of exceptions to the correlation between trichromatism and red coloration. Explanations for such exceptions include lack of suitable genetic variation in the species concerned, lack of the appropriate diet or predator pressure. Fernandez and Morris add that their research may tie in with work on the evolutionary history of the vomeronasal organ. This is a sensor for scent signalling, and there is evidence that its functional loss in Old World monkeys coincided with the advent of colour vision \u2014 prompting the idea that chemical signalling gave way to visual cues.

Townes"}], "parsed_as_year": "2006_or_before", "body": "Maker of the first laser. The physicist Theodore (Ted) Maiman died on 5 May in Vancouver, British Columbia, at the age of 79. As creator of the first operating laser, he has left an enduring mark on science and technology. Maiman was born in Los Angeles, California, and showed an early aptitude for electrical engineering which took him first to the University of Colorado and then to Stanford University, where he was awarded a PhD in 1955. Subsequently, as a young scientist at Hughes Aircraft Company in Malibu, California, he worked on the amplification of microwaves by masers, and was eager to produce similar amplification at light wavelengths. His superiors at Hughes were wary of such work, wanting Maiman to do \u201csomething useful\u201d. But on his insistence, they let him proceed. His breakthrough involved the use of a ruby crystal, which others interested in lasers thought would probably not work. However, Maiman introduced a technique that had not been considered, the excitation of ruby with an intense flash lamp. And it worked! A powerful red light beam was produced, lasting only the short time of the exciting flash, but nevertheless providing remarkably high intensity \u2014 many orders of magnitude more intense than any previous light source. And it formed a coherent, highly directed beam. Because the laser pulses produced lasted only a short time, others were eager to produce continuously operating lasers, which they soon did. But the very short pulses that lasers produce are themselves now exciting tools used in science and for wireless communication systems. Maiman initially sent a description of his device to  Physical Review Letters . But it was rejected because so many manuscripts on masers had been submitted to the journal that its editors made the unusual decision to accept no more papers in the field. So Maiman sent it to  Nature , where his now famous paper, \u201cStimulated optical radiation in ruby\u201d, appeared on 6 August 1960 (T. H. Maiman  Nature   187 , 493\u2013494; 1960). It was very brief, and I have previously commented that this article was probably more important per word than any of the papers published by  Nature  over the past century. The device was quickly replicated by many other scientists, still other types were invented, and soon the word laser \u2014 for 'light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation' \u2014 was common currency. Few applications for lasers were initially envisaged by most scientists; it was sometimes referred to as \u201ca solution looking for a problem\u201d. But the ensuing development of the principle produced many forms of laser \u2014 ranging in size from the minuscule to the enormous \u2014 and they have now permeated almost all fields of science and technology. Lasers are widespread in industry and are tools for much new science: their use underlies the award of several Nobel prizes. They are now exploited in cutting and welding; in communications; for high-precision measurements and convenient directional control; in nanotechnology; in innovative forms of microscopy and for manipulating microorganisms; in computing; and in medicine. Precise measurement of the distance between Earth and the Moon has been provided by lasers, and some scientists are looking for possible laser signals from planets around distant stars, guessing that intelligent extraterrestrial beings would use them to signal to us. Maiman himself was particularly pleased with the medical applications of lasers, such as reattachment of detached retinas. He did not like, and played down, their use as weapons. This was a popular idea for a while after the tremendous potential power of the technology was recognized. Infrared lasers (wavelength 30\u20131,000 \u00b5m) have found application in detecting explosives and in chemical-warfare agents. If the word 'erasers' were not already in use, perhaps infrared amplification by stimulated emission would be produced by 'irasers'. But the term laser actually refers to such systems with wavelengths up to 1 mm (above which the name maser takes over), and also to much shorter wavelengths: X-ray and \u03b3-ray lasers are now with us, and their likely further development may prompt yet further scientific progress. Stimulated emission of radiation, the critical process behind the laser, was first recognized by Albert Einstein as early as 1918. But it was only in 1951 that its use for practical amplification of electromagnetic waves was recognized, and in 1954 the first such device, the maser (for 'microwave amplification by stimulated emission'), operating at centimetre wavelengths, was constructed. Art Schawlow and I pointed out in 1958 how the same process could be made to work for light waves, which then set off a flurry of work in many places to actually build such a device. All the earliest types of laser were invented in industry by recently hired young physicists who came from university work in radio or microwave spectroscopy. This appropriately brought together engineering and spectroscopy. Maiman's background was just such a case: at Stanford he had been a student of Willis Lamb, a Nobel laureate for his research on the spectrum of hydrogen. The next type of laser, similar to Maiman's but using a different type of crystal, was made by Peter Sorokin and Mirek Stevenson at IBM in Yorktown Heights, New York. The next was a continuously operating laser produced by an electrical discharge, created by Ali Javan, William Bennett and Don Herriott at the Bell Telephone Labs in Murray Hill, New Jersey. After his invention, Maiman did early research in nonlinear optics, a field made possible by intense laser beams. He also formed several companies devoted to laser development and applications, including, in 1962, the Korad Corporation. His own account of his discovery was published in his book  The Laser Odyssey , which was published in 2000. Theodore Maiman's contribution, the first operating laser on Earth (they have now been found to occur naturally in astronomical objects) was truly historic, and has been widely recognized. He was chosen to be a member of the National Inventors Hall of Fame and of the US National Academies, and received many awards, including the Wolf Prize in Physics, the Oliver Buckley Prize and the Japan Prize.

The latest example may expand chemical reactivity beyond the achievements of traditional metal complexes. Chemists are currently excited about a different take on organic synthesis, in which purely organic molecules are used as catalysts, rather than metals or enzymes. This previously neglected strategy holds great promise in areas such as drug discovery and materials science, and has already been used in several valuable reactions. But so far, these processes have involved only charged intermediates. Reporting in  Science , MacMillan and colleagues 1  now describe a general strategy for organocatalysis using radical intermediates \u2014 molecules that contain reactive single electrons. The principle behind this could lead to a new family of useful reactions. Most naturally occurring compounds are chiral: they are not superimposable on their mirror images. Using enzymes as catalysts, nature is the uncontested master at producing chiral compounds as just one mirror-image version \u2014 in enantiomerically pure form, to use the technical jargon. Chemists, however, have to rely on different approaches to render their reactions enantioselective, although their inspiration may still come from nature. Early efforts emulated metal-containing enzymes, and many metal catalysts have been developed that induce one particular chirality in a wide range of chemical transformations 2 . But half of all known enzymes are metal-free, and it is these that organic chemists seek to mimic. Organocatalysis has now emerged as a promising strategy that avoids using protein catalysts or potentially toxic and expensive metals 3 , 4 . Not only does it complement established methods, but it sometimes also overcomes their limitations, so that many unprecedented transformations can be realized. MacMillan and co-workers' radical reactions 1  are catalysed by chiral amines \u2014 organic compounds that contain a basic nitrogen atom. Such organocatalysis is related to that seen in certain enzymes that are crucial for sugar metabolism, and has ancient synthetic roots 5 . But although amines and amino acids were used in a narrow context as chiral catalysts in the 1970s, a clear understanding of their catalytic behaviour was lacking. It was another 30 years before the mechanistic principle was realized; this was termed 'enamine catalysis', after the intermediate that forms during the process 6 . The true potential of this approach then became apparent with the discovery of several valuable and predictable transformations. A related method, known as iminium catalysis, was developed in parallel 7 . These two concepts are collectively known as aminocatalysis 8 . To understand how aminocatalysis works, one has to know a little about molecular orbitals. Two need to be considered \u2014 the most energetic orbital that contains electrons (known as the HOMO) and the least energetic orbital that doesn't contain electrons (the LUMO). Enamine formation increases the HOMO energy of the starting materials (aldehydes and ketones), whereas iminium ion formation lowers the LUMO energy. Both catalytic modes activate the substrates towards reaction and facilitate attack from reagents that seek areas of negative or positive charge. But these modes of action are based on the natural polarity of the reactants, which limits organocatalysis to transformations that are \u2014 at least in principle \u2014 also possible with metal-based catalysis. MacMillan and co-workers 1  overcome this limitation by introducing a third mode of aminocatalysis, based on radical intermediates. Amines and aldehydes react to form iminium ions, which may convert into enamines in an equilibrium process ( Fig. 1a ); this equilibrium has been exploited in enantioselective reactions that sequentially react by enamine and iminium catalysis 9 . But enamines can be intercepted by an oxidizing agent, which removes an electron from the intermediate to generate a positively charged radical; the highest-energy orbital of this radical cation contains a single electron, and is known as a SOMO. The radical intermediate is more susceptible to subsequent chemical attack than the aldehyde starting material. Such SOMO-activation was previously known only in a single example of a light-driven enantioselective reaction 10  and in reactions that were not enantioselective and which required a whole equivalent of amine per mole of the starting material 11 . MacMillan and colleagues 1  have revisited this concept, and have improved it by developing an enantioselective version that requires much less amine. The amine catalyst used (an imidazolidinone;  Fig. 1a ) had previously been developed by their group 7 . The authors chose several reactions to demonstrate the generality of their concept. All of them result in the formation of carbon\u2013carbon bonds adjacent to the carbonyl group (C=O) of aldehydes, a transformation that is extremely useful in organic synthesis. One of these reactions was studied in great detail \u2014 the addition to aldehydes of hydrocarbon fragments that are based on a three-carbon unit called an allyl group ( Fig. 1b ). Several aldehydes were reacted with structurally diverse allyl reagents, to give products with good chemical yields and enantioselectivities. Previously, such reactions were restricted to using 'electrophilic' reagents that generate allyl cations 12 . The new approach opens up fresh possibilities by permitting the use of reagents that would normally generate allyl anions. Impressive as this work is, there are still limitations. For example, each mole of aldehyde requires two equivalents of the oxidizing agent. It would be more efficient if the oxidant could be recycled during the reaction, so that a much smaller amount could be used. Such an approach has recently been described 13  for an enantioselective reaction that forms carbon\u2013oxygen bonds, using SOMO-activation by a chiral amine catalyst. That report, taken together with the work of MacMillan and colleagues 1 , clearly marks the beginning of a new aminocatalytic concept, with many applications expected in the near future. This mode of reaction will surely have a major impact on organic synthesis. Reprints and Permissions"},

But, recently, owners have been reporting an increase in 'double muscling', a trait characterized by cramping in the shoulders and thighs of otherwise healthy whippets. Dana Mosher and colleagues now show that a mutation in the  MSTN  gene is the culprit (D. S. Mosher  et al .  PLoS Genet.  e79.eor doi:10.1371/journal.pgen.0030079.eor; 2007). The  MSTN  gene encodes myostatin, a protein that affects muscle composition. Mosher  et al . analysed the sequence of  MSTN  from three categories of whippet: the heavy-muscled 'bully' whippets, which have double muscling; parents of bully whippets; and normal whippets unrelated to bullies. They found that all bully whippets carry a mutation in both copies of the  MSTN  gene, and all bully-whippet parents have the same mutation in one copy of this gene. This mutation involves deletion of only two DNA base pairs, resulting in premature termination of messenger RNA translation and a truncated form of myostatin. Looking for a correlation between this  MSTN  mutation and whippets' racing performance, the authors observed a significant association between the dogs' speed, their muscle mass and their genetic profile. Whippets with one mutated copy of  MSTN  were generally the fastest, followed by normal animals. Bully whippets are rarely raced, probably because they are handicapped by an excess of muscle. The increase in the incidence of the  MSTN  mutation is probably due to selective breeding of whippets. Mosher  et al . did not detect this mutation in 14 other heavy-muscled breeds of dog, suggesting that it might be unique to whippets. There is the question of whether a similar mutation in humans could be exploited to enhance athletic performance. However, the authors caution that effects of the  MSTN  mutation on other aspects of health are unknown. Reprints and Permissions"},

John Backus, who died on 17 March, was a pioneer in the early development of computer programming languages, and was subsequently a leading researcher in so-called functional programming. He spent his entire career with IBM. Backus was born on 3 December 1924 in Philadelphia, and was raised in Wilmington, Delaware. His father had been trained as a chemist, but changed careers to become a partner in a brokerage house, and the family became wealthy and socially prominent. As a child, Backus enjoyed mechanical tinkering and loved his chemistry set, but showed little scholastic interest or aptitude. He was sent to The Hill School, an exclusive private high school in Pottstown, Pennsylvania. His academic performance was so poor that he had to attend summer camps to catch up on his studies. He fared no better at the University of Virginia, where he enrolled for a degree in chemical engineering in 1942, and from which he was sent down for poor attendance. Backus was drafted into the US Army in early 1943, where he was initially put on an anti-aircraft programme. Aptitude tests revealed his high intelligence, and he was sent on a specialist engineering course at the University of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. He also tried a pre-medical training course, but lost enthusiasm and dropped out. After leaving the army in May 1946, he enrolled at Columbia University, New York, initially as a probationary student because of his poor academic record. In mathematics, he at last found his calling, graduating with a BA in 1949 and obtaining a master's degree the following year. In 1948, IBM had completed its first experimental electronic computer, known as the Selective Sequence Electronic Calculator (SSEC). It was a huge machine with 13,000 tubes and 23,000 relays. IBM displayed the machine in the showroom of its New York headquarters, where it was visible to passers-by and attracted much media attention. Backus went to see the SSEC, and persuaded IBM to hire him as a programmer. He spent the next year of his life calculating lunar positions, which he found a delight. IBM introduced its first commercial computer product, the model 701, in 1952. The computer had to be programmed at a level very close to basic binary machine code, which was not intrinsically difficult but time-consuming and error-prone. Backus devised an automatic programming system called Speedcoding for the 701, which made the task much easier. Like similar systems being developed elsewhere around the same time, however, Speedcoding produced programs that were uneconomically slow. Backus proposed to his manager the development of a system he called the Formula Translator \u2014 later contracted to Fortran \u2014 in autumn 1953 for the model 704 computer, which was soon to be launched. The unique feature of Fortran was that it would produce programs that were 90% as good as those written by a human programmer. Backus got the go-ahead, and was allocated a team of ten programmers for six months. Designing a translator that produced efficient programs turned out to be a huge challenge, and, by the time the system was launched in April 1957, six months had become three years. The Formula Translator consisted of 18,000 instructions, which was not especially long as programs went, but it embodied fiendishly complex algorithms for code optimization. Fortran was eagerly taken up by users of the IBM 704, and other computer manufacturers also produced Fortran systems so that their machines' software would be compatible with IBM's. Fortran became the  lingua franca  of scientific computing, which it remains 50 years on \u2014 today, for example, the UK Meteorological Office's computer model for climate change consists of a one-million-line Fortran program. Fortran has often been criticized for its inelegance, but as Backus subsequently explained, when it was being designed efficiency was paramount and very little thought was given to the language itself. And of course, no one could have dreamed that the language would still be going strong half a century later. Because of the need for backward compatibility, Fortran has never escaped the path-dependency of those early decisions. In the late 1950s Backus became a member of the Algol Committee, which was designing an international scientific programming language, named Algol 60. The language was specified in Backus\u2013Naur form, a notation that Backus devised in collaboration with the Danish computer scientist Peter Naur. Algol 60 was an elegant language that was popular in Europe in the 1960s and 1970s. However, it was never able to replace Fortran, primarily because of the investment already made in the Fortran code. Nonetheless, Algol was hugely influential in programming-language design \u2014 most modern programming languages, such as C and Java, can trace their roots to the language, and the Backus\u2013Naur form is part of the computer-science canon. After the pizzazz of the Fortran years, Backus's subsequent career was calmly scientific. In 1960 he became a staff member of IBM Research, Yorktown Heights, New York. In 1963 he was made an IBM fellow and spent the remainder of his career, until he retired in 1991, with IBM in both Yorktown Heights and San Jose, California. At IBM Research, Backus led a research group in functional programming, a new programming paradigm that aimed at computation through the evaluation of mathematical functions. The idea was to bypass what Backus called the 'von Neumann bottleneck', after John von Neumann, one of the inventors of the computer. As Backus explained it, a computer consisted of a processor and a memory; the object of a program was to change the state of the memory, using the processor, but this had to be done painfully slowly, one instruction at a time. But although functional programming became (and remains) a major computer-science research topic worldwide, it has never broken through to the mainstream. Fortran remained Backus's lasting contribution to computing, for which he was awarded the National Medal of Science in 1975 and the Turing Award of the Association of Computing Machinery in 1977 \u2014 computer science's highest honour.

An unseen component of forest ecology is the emission, by both plants and animals, of a cocktail of volatile organic compounds into the atmosphere. Emissions from plants exceed those from animals by several orders of magnitude, and have various purposes, such as repelling herbivorous animals or attracting specific insects for pollination. A little-understood aspect of the chemistry of these compounds is the possibly different emission patterns of different chiral (mirror-image) forms, known as enantiomers, of the same compound. With a Lear jet as one of their platforms, Williams  et al . 1  have undertaken an ecosystem-scale sampling of air over tropical forest. As they report in  Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics , they find distinct differences between the enantiomeric composition of a common volatile compound emitted by tropical forest compared with boreal forest. Plant emission of volatile organic compounds occurs on a vast scale, estimated at 1,150 Tg carbon (1 Tg = 10 12  g) annually 2 . Many of these compounds are built up from isoprene (C 5 ) subunits and are traditionally given the collective name terpenes 3 . Together, isoprene and its monoterpene derivatives (C 10 H 16 ) make up 55% of the estimated emissions 2 . Many monoterpenes are produced in two enantiomeric forms: \u03b1-pinene, a common example, occurs as both (+)-\u03b1-pinene and (\u2212)-\u03b1-pinene. The light-induced oxidation of natural and man-made volatile organic compounds affects the chemical and physical properties of the atmosphere 4 , 5 . But although the importance of different enantiomers for the biological activity of a compound is well known, the implications for atmospheric chemistry have not been established 6 . Indeed, the global effect of compounds such as monoterpenes has been estimated by measurements and models that consider the enantiomeric forms as one 2 . The work of Williams  et al . 1  is an attempt to use a detailed enantiomeric characterization of monoterpene patterns in the atmosphere as a tool to enable a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying their emission from plants. This is where the Lear jet came in. Williams  et al . took air samples from an aircraft making flights of 3 hours, with a range of 1,800 km, over the tropical forest of the northeast coast of South America, and subsequently analysed the monoterpene content. They also sampled ambient air at the level of the forest canopy at a site in Suriname, within the region surveyed. The other sites of investigation were boreal pine forest in Finland, samples being taken at a height of 8 m from the ground, and the greenhouse of the botanical garden of the Johannes Gutenberg University in Mainz, Germany, where 8,500 plant species from all over the world are cultivated. Most notably, monoterpenes emitted from the tropical forest showed an excess of the (\u2212) enantiomer of \u03b1-pinene, and also of the (+) enantiomer of \u03b2-pinene. The monoterpene emissions from a mixture of three tropical species in the greenhouse of the botanical garden likewise showed an excess of (\u2212)-\u03b1-pinene. Laboratory studies 6  have shown that both enantiomers of \u03b1-pinene react at the same rate with atmospheric oxidants (hydroxyl radicals and ozone). So the dominance of one enantiomer over the other does not imply preferential atmospheric removal of one of them. Rather, the explanation probably lies in the factors influencing emissions by plants. In that respect, studies of leaf chemistry 2  have shown that the strength of isoprene emission is a function of both light and temperature. In contrast, although monoterpene emission rates increase with temperature, plant species show differential sensitivity to temperature; different monoterpenes can also exhibit differing temperature dependence. To interpret their observations, Williams  et al . compared the concentrations of isoprene, (\u2212)-\u03b1-pinene and (+)-\u03b1-pinene measured over tropical forest. They observed a surprising correlation between (\u2212)-\u03b1-pinene and isoprene, but no correlation between its mirror image (+)-\u03b1-pinene and isoprene. The converse applied to emissions from the boreal forest: there was a clear predominance of (+)-\u03b1-pinene and (\u2212)-\u03b2-pinene. A previous study 7  conducted in the same boreal forest showed that rates of emission of non-enantiomerically resolved \u03b1-pinene were temperature dependent. On the basis of both their own results 1  and this earlier work 7 , Williams and colleagues propose that over the tropical forest, emission of (\u2212)-\u03b1-pinene is \u2014 like that of isoprene \u2014 light-dependent, whereas that of (+)-\u03b1-pinene over the boreal forest is temperature-dependent. Volatile organic compounds have a fundamental role in the coexistence of the flora and fauna in ecosystems. But there is still much to learn about the relationships and interactions between species that can be related to an effect of naturally produced compounds such as monoterpenes. Studies 8  of the biosynthesis and the enantiomeric composition of monoterpenes in forest trees has shown that different enzymes (terpene cyclases) are responsible for the production of the two enantiomers. This supports the observation that enantiomeric composition varies in different tissues and in different individual trees 8 . Research aimed at correlating the enantiomeric composition of monoterpenes from different parts of specific trees with the corresponding enantiomeric composition of emissions by the same trees under specific environmental conditions \u2014 light, temperature and humidity \u2014 will be necessary for a fuller understanding of the mechanisms of the emission of volatile organic compounds into the atmosphere. Microbial degradation and plant metabolism might be selective towards a specific enantiomer; but processes in the atmosphere such as photo-oxidation are not. So chiral analysis will be a powerful additional tool in atmospheric chemistry for investigating the sources of emission and the fates of chemical compounds in various environments 9 . The main message of Williams and colleagues' work is that ecosystem-scale field studies involving sophisticated sampling and analytical techniques are required to make sense of the biochemistry and ecology of these natural emissions, and of other physical and chemical observations in the atmosphere.

Nano Lett.   6,  583\u2013586; 2006). But where the particles to be weighed are suspended in solution (as is the case, for example, in many biological settings), the technique hits a snag: the viscosity of the fluid damps the resonator, and significantly decreases its sensitivity. Elsewhere in this issue, Scott Manalis and colleagues present what might be described as a radical solution to the problem: putting the fluid inside the resonator (T. P. Burg  et al .  Nature   446 , 1066\u20131069; 2007 ). They have designed a vacuum-sealed silicon microcantilever with hollow channels (pictured), connected to pressure-controlled inlets and outlets for fluid delivery. The device works in two modes. In the first, which is particularly suited to selective detection of biomolecules, a solution is continuously run through the channels and particles can adsorb on the channels' inner surface \u2014 which must be specially prepared for the purpose. The authors demonstrate how the mass change can be followed by monitoring shifts in the resonance frequency of the cantilever in real time as proteins in solution become bound to appropriate receptor molecules that have been grafted onto the tube surface. In a second mode, particles are detected in transit through the channels; this is useful for weighing particles in dilute solutions. An experiment in this mode determined the distribution in masses, with a resolution of one femtogram, for two types of live bacterial cell, of average masses 110 and 150 femtograms. The work is an example of the steady progress that is being made in designing practical, inexpensive and portable lab-on-a-chip diagnostic devices. Although further advances are required to demonstrate a 'killer application' for Burg and colleagues' fluidic sensor \u2014 a medically relevant specific detection of viruses in blood samples, for example \u2014 it is already an elegant method for weighing tiny particles in solution.

White"}], "parsed_as_year": "2006_or_before", "body": "Palaeoanthropologist who defined a discipline. F. Clark Howell was the principal architect and prime mover of the multidisciplinary study of human evolution in the past half-century. In a career during which he came to personify palaeoanthropology, Howell distinguished himself through his unbounded curiosity, unparalleled scholarship, inspirational leadership, modesty and humanity. He died in Berkeley, California, on 10 March. Howell was born in Kansas City in 1925. Raised on a small farm, he attended a one-room Kansas schoolhouse until the 1937 recession changed much of the US Midwest to a dust bowl, and Howell's father became a travelling salesman. After service as a navy signalman in the Pacific during the Second World War, Howell met the palaeontologists George Gaylord Simpson, Franz Weidenreich and Ralph von Koenigswald, then working at the American Museum of Natural History in New York. These meetings proved Howell's inspiration, and he enrolled under the GI Bill of Rights as an undergraduate at the University of Chicago in 1947, completing a PhD in anthropology there in 1953. Howell went on to teach anatomy at Washington University, St Louis, and in 1954 embarked on his first journey to a mostly still-colonial Africa. During this six-month study tour, Howell became friends with such pioneers of African prehistory as Raymond Dart, and Louis and Mary Leakey. Returning to the University of Chicago as assistant professor in 1955, Howell, together with Sherwood Washburn, helped Africa to emerge as the focus of a new, multifaceted approach to research on human origins and evolution that brought together strands from geology, climatology, ecology, archaeology, evolutionary biology and many other disciplines. In 1957 and 1958, together with his wife Betty, Howell excavated 'Acheulean' sites containing hand-axes from the Middle Pleistocene at Isimila in the highlands of what was then Tanganyika. In 1959, he made a preliminary survey of fossil-bearing deposits in the lower Omo Valley of southern Ethiopia, and was in Nairobi, Kenya, to receive at first hand the news of Mary Leakey's momentous discovery of the early hominid  Australopithecus  in the Olduvai Gorge. From the very start of his career, however, Howell's interest in human evolution was not confined to Africa, but spanned all continents and epochs. From the 1950s onwards, he published work bringing together Eurasian palaeobiology, archaeology and geology. In 1956, he attended the conference marking the centennial anniversary of the Neanderthal fossil discovery in Germany, and last summer was the keynote speaker at the 150th anniversary celebrations in Bonn. Howell displayed an unparalleled ability to operate effectively at the interface of numerous disciplines. And more than any other biological anthropologist, he was able to maintain a career-long balance that met the demands of substantive and extended fieldwork in the Old World; of professional organization, communication and teaching; and of a commitment to promoting and funding research by young scholars from all over the world. Although Howell conducted three excavation seasons at Acheulean sites in Spain in the 1960s, his signature work came with his leadership of the American contingent of the International Omo Research Expedition in southern Ethiopia between 1967 and 1973. This project put his philosophy and skills on international display, and set standards for the field as we now know it. Thousands of vertebrate fossils, including dozens of hominid specimens, were recovered from precisely documented stratigraphic and palaeoenvironmental contexts. The era of multidisciplinary, international palaeoanthropology had begun. Howell worked tirelessly to make the knowledge generated by his science accessible to a general audience, and so attracted new generations of students to it. In the 1960s, with illustrator Jay Matternes and author Maitland Edey, he created the  Early Man  volume for the Time-Life  Nature  series. He was senior scientific adviser to MGM for an Emmy-nominated network-television documentary,  The Man-Hunters , that featured his Omo fieldwork. Howell left Chicago in 1970 to join the University of California, Berkeley, founding the Laboratory for Human Evolutionary Studies (now the Human Evolution Research Center), and continuing his multidisciplinary researches there. Berkeley was thus placed at the forefront of human-origins research. On the international front, hard on the heels of US President Richard Nixon's historic trip to the People's Republic of China, Howell led the first National Academy of Sciences anthropological delegation to that country in 1975. In the early 1980s, Howell returned to Spain for further excavations, moving on at the decade's end to extensive surveys and excavations in Turkey. His official retirement in 1991 allowed him to become even more active in advising, writing, conducting field and laboratory work, and enjoying life. The Howells travelled abroad almost yearly to visit friends and institutions in dozens of countries across the world. Howell also read voraciously in many languages throughout his career. His knowledge was correspondingly encyclopaedic, covering subjects as diverse as Neogene carnivoran palaeontology, Turkish tectonics, classical jazz, palaeolithic typologies and molecular systematics. In science, Howell's influence went beyond academia. His indefatigable efforts with the Leakey Foundation over 38 years enabled generations of students to expand and enrich our knowledge of human evolution. In the words of a former student, Howell \u201cmade good things happen by putting the right people together in a common cause\u201d. During his final four years, he did this again by assembling and steering the largest-ever palaeoanthropological research enterprise, the Revealing Hominid Origins Initiative funded by the National Science Foundation's HOMINID programme, aiming to illuminate the trunk of humanity's family tree. Howell's achievements and published work, honoured by numerous awards and appointments, were broad, and will be lastingly influential. In a field where transient celebrity is sometimes associated with finding particular hominid fossils, Howell never sought popular adulation. He was a scholar's scholar, as the many tributes paid by colleagues on his death show ( http://herc.berkeley.edu/fc_howell_memorial ). He brought his unique combination of knowledge, wisdom, vision and generosity to bear in steadfast advocacy of the developing science of human evolution. Reprints and Permissions"},

Ransom Myers's life as a working scientist spanned the period during which classical fisheries science lost its way. Founded a century ago as an applied discipline, it was essentially devoted to assisting the fishing industry in locating and monitoring fish stocks and optimizing catches. The concept of 'sustainability' was tacked on only much later, as successive fish stocks collapsed. Today, fisheries scientists are a divided lot, torn between those loyal to the interests of the fishing industry and those who see their role as studying marine biodiversity, and so protecting it from the largest remaining hunt on the planet. Myers was a leader among those who caused this rift. In passing away so soon, he will not see it heal, as it inevitably must. He began his career in 1984 innocuously enough. Armed with a freshly minted PhD from Dalhousie University in Halifax, Canada, he took work \u2014 like most of the world's fisheries scientists \u2014 in a government laboratory, in this case one belonging to Canada's Department of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO) in St John's, Newfoundland. As was usual, he was involved in assessing the local, commercially important fish stocks. Equally typically, as a sideline he joined the search for an answer to the greatest mystery of fisheries science: what is it that determines the number of young fish that enter an adult population, given a parental stock that releases immense quantities of tiny eggs into the vagaries of a turbulent ocean? Myers's attack on this 'stock recruitment' problem was atypical in that he eschewed the correlational studies that had been favoured up to that time. Such studies link recruitment variability to some environmental parameter, and invariably fail the year after they are published. Rather, his attack on the problem used the formidable mathematical skills he had acquired through his earlier degrees: a BSc in physics from Rice University in Houston, Texas, and an MSc in mathematics from Dalhousie. Rather than relying on data from a single species \u2014 the bane of much work in the area \u2014 Myers constructed a meta-analysis of more than 500 time-series of spawning-stock sizes and subsequent recruitment in a vast number of commercially exploited species. Together with a few colleagues, he had painstakingly collected these time-series from hundreds of reports of fisheries agencies throughout the world. Myers succeeded in renormalizing the data in the spawning-stock and recruitment series so that they could be expressed in comparable units within each stock and between stocks and species. In this way, he was able to show that, at low population sizes, the females of most commercial marine fishes produce only three to five viable young a year, in spite of the millions of eggs they may shed and that are fertilized in the process. Until then, most fisheries scientists had believed that overexploited populations could easily rebound from depletion induced by fishing \u2014 a belief now known as the millions-of-eggs fallacy. With this result, published in 1999, Myers disposed of one of the central reasons why fisheries scientists had underestimated the impact of fishing and provided fisheries managers with over-optimistic advice. Meanwhile, the stock of northern cod off Canada's Atlantic province of Newfoundland and Labrador, managed under the auspices of the DFO, had collapsed. A moratorium on its commercial exploitation was imposed in 1992. It had been one of the most important fish stocks in the North Atlantic, commercially and culturally important to Canada, and was supposedly one of the best studied and managed fish stocks in the world. Myers did not go along with the voracious seals, cold temperatures and other excuses invented by an agency that, by caving in to industry pressure, had failed to protect this vital resource and the province that depended on it. He was a leader among the handful of DFO scientists who published evidence that excessive fishing was the sole cause of the stock's collapse. Unsurprisingly, given the press and public reaction to these papers, Myers was reprimanded by his superiors. He took refuge in academia, taking in 1997 the Killam Chair in Ocean Studies at Dalhousie. From there, aided by colleagues and several brilliant graduate students, he published a series of papers showing that politically motivated, slothful optimism had masked the systematic destruction of marine resources, and marine biodiversity in general \u2014 not just in Canada and its marine jurisdictions, but the world over. These papers, again based on judicious analysis of existing time-series data, documented the worldwide depletion, through industrial fishing, of skate, sharks, large bottom fishes and, finally, large pelagic fishes such as marlin and tuna. Each new paper baited the staff of yet another agency into angry rebuttals. Myers had the thick skin required for such acrimonious debates. Once, when asked about the controversy that one of his papers had generated, his response was simply: \u201cThey are wrong, and I am right!\u201d In the process, Myers helped to found fisheries conservation biology. This discipline is devoted to identifying exploited fish populations and species threatened with extinction, and suggesting measures for rebuilding them, along with the ecosystems in which they are embedded. Correspondingly, its primary clients are not the owners of trawlers, longliners, purse seiners and other industrial vessels, but national and international agencies mandated with maintaining marine biodiversity and ecosystems, and the many benefits they provide for society as a whole. If fisheries conservation biology and its guiding philosophy thrive, it will be because of the energies of the likes of RAM \u2014 as Myers, who died of brain cancer on 27 March this year, liked to be called. RAM is survived by his wife Rita and five children. Reprints and Permissions"},

His influence on the subject was profound, not only through his original research but also through his books and the meetings he organized. Schmidt-Nielsen was born in Norway but moved to the United States in 1946. Much of his finest work concerns life in deserts, where the combination of heat and drought makes survival particularly difficult. The most effective means of keeping cool depend on evaporation of precious water, either in the breath or as sweat, but kangaroo rats survive in the Arizona Desert with nothing at all to drink. They keep reasonably cool by spending the day in burrows and emerging only at night. But even at night they would lose much too much water in their breath if it were not for their remarkable noses. The air they breathe in is relatively cool and dry, but it is inevitably warmed in the body and becomes saturated with water vapour. To minimize water loss, this air must be cooled before it leaves the body to condense out most of the vapour. With his first wife Bodil, Schmidt-Nielsen showed that the incoming air cools the surfaces of the nasal cavity, which, in turn, cool the air when it is breathed out again. He showed that the same principle operates in other mammals and birds, but is particularly effective in kangaroo rats because their nasal surfaces are enlarged by elaborate nasal bones known as turbinals. They also save water by producing exceptionally concentrated urine. The countercurrent effect in the nose is vital to desert rodents. But it is potentially troublesome to dogs overheated by exercise, as they need to let water evaporate to cool themselves. With colleagues, Schmidt-Nielsen showed that panting dogs avoid the effect by breathing in through the nose but out through the mouth. Unlike kangaroo rats, camels are too big to retire to burrows in the heat of the day. Working in the Sahara Desert, the Schmidt-Nielsens showed that camels avoid the water loss that evaporative cooling would incur by allowing their bodies to heat up by day and cool by night. A camel may start the morning with a body temperature of only 34 \u00b0C, but warms to 41 \u00b0C during the afternoon. This strategy would be ineffective for small animals such as kangaroo rats, because they would quickly heat up to lethal temperatures, but it works well for camels. Later, in Australia, Schmidt-Nielsen showed that camels' noses conserve water even more effectively than do those of kangaroo rats; hygroscopic surfaces dry the outgoing air. Sea birds face a different problem: they have nothing to drink but sea water, which has a much higher osmotic concentration than their blood. In principle, they could produce urine even more concentrated than sea water, but their kidneys are not equal to the task. Instead, Schmidt-Nielsen found that glands opening into their nostrils secrete droplets of concentrated salt solution that are shed by a shake of the head. With William Bretz, he tackled another aspect of bird physiology \u2014 the operation of their lungs. The lungs of birds are very different from those of mammals: instead of being a mass of blind-ended sacs they are formed from slender parallel tubes. Mammalian breathing is a reciprocating process; the air leaves by the same route that it came in. However, Schmidt-Nielsen and Bretz showed that airflow is one-way in bird lungs, flowing in at one end of the tubes and out at the other, and they suggested that gas exchange is enhanced by a countercurrent flow of air and blood. This would help birds to get oxygen into the blood at the high rates needed to power active flight. In the later part of his career, Schmidt-Nielsen concentrated on the consequences for animals of differences in body size. With C. R. (Dick) Taylor and other colleagues, he measured the rates of oxygen consumption of various mammals, ranging from mice to horses, running at different speeds. They calculated the quantity of oxygen used for each kilogram of animal moving a distance of one metre, and found that this was less for larger animals, falling off in proportion to (body mass) \u22120.4 . Data for flying birds and swimming fish showed similar relationships to body mass, although flight is cheaper than running (for the same body mass), and swimming is cheaper still. These findings, and later work on this theme by others, have given valuable insight into the energy budgets of animals. They have also caused puzzlement (still not wholly dissipated), because they imply that the muscles of small animals work less efficiently than those of large ones. Of his books,  Desert Animals  (1964) and  Scaling  (1984) cover Schmidt-Nielsen's two main fields of interest. His  Animal Physiology  (1960 and later editions) has been used and appreciated by countless students.  How Animals Work  (1972), my favourite among his books, is a small masterpiece.  The Camel's Nose  (1998) is his autobiography. Schmidt-Nielsen understood the value of bringing scientists together. Like the other participants, I benefited enormously from the series of select meetings that he and Liana Bolis arranged at delightful locations in Europe. He convened the small preliminary meeting that laid the foundation for the 1975 'Scaling Conference' in Cambridge, UK, a meeting that inspired much subsequent research. He was president of the International Union of Physiological Sciences from 1980 to 1986. A fine bronze statue celebrating Schmidt-Nielsen's work with desert animals in particular, which is shown in the picture here, stands outside the Department of Biology at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina, where he had worked since 1952. He received many other honours, including the International Prize for Biology, presented at an impressive ceremony by the Emperor of Japan. He was nevertheless unassuming, with the slight diffidence of manner characteristic of the old-fashioned ideal of the perfect gentleman. He and his wife Margareta were among the most delightful hosts I have known. Reprints and Permissions"},

It is native to the western Pacific, but following introduction to other parts of the Pacific, and then to southern Europe, it was brought to Britain in the 1980s as a source of seafood. At one site in Britain, Poole Harbour in Dorset, the clam ( Tapes philippinarum ) has now become naturalized. This could be worrying: when colonizing fresh regions, invasive species may devastate components of the existing flora and fauna. For the Eurasian oystercatcher, however, the advent of the clam at Poole is good news, as Richard Caldow and colleagues report (R. G. W. Caldow  et al .  Proc. R. Soc. B  doi: 10.1098/rspb.2007.0072). This species of bird,  Haematopus ostralegus ostralegus  (pictured), overwinters in Poole Harbour. From their observations of its feeding habits, and from modelling studies, the authors conclude that the oystercatchers have benefited considerably from the extra source of food. Their observations show that a large proportion of the overwintering oystercatcher population of around 1,200 feeds on the clams, a habit not previously recorded, and that clam meat constitutes a notable part of the birds' diet. The simulations were carried out with an 'individuals-based' model of shorebird foraging, with the aim of providing a population-level estimate of the effect of the additional food source. The predicted result is a significant reduction in the mortality of the birds, which face the prospect of starvation in the period between September and March. As yet, there is no evidence that the Manila clam has affected other species of bivalve at Poole, although it occurs at low densities there compared with populations of the species elsewhere. But the clams' occupation of this northern site was probably made possible by locally warm sea temperatures, and Caldow  et al . raise the inevitable question of what consequences a continued warming might have. They envisage a further spread north. That process might exacerbate the retreat of the cold-water species that currently constitute food sources for shorebirds. But if, like the Eurasian oystercatcher, other birds develop a taste for the clam, the results might even be beneficial \u2014 at least from the avian point of view. Reprints and Permissions"},

On March 29 my son directed my attention to a large golden carp ( C. auratus ) lying in shallow water near the edge of a pond in my garden with a frog or toad apparently resting on its head. The fish appeared to be very sluggish... On examination it was found that the head of the fish was held tightly by a medium-sized common toad ( Bufo vulgaris ), which had obtained a very firm grasp by inserting its fore-limbs as far as the second, or elbow, joint into the sockets of the eyes of the unfortunate fish... A few years ago in the same pond... I found a toad embracing a water-logged puffball so firmly that it required considerable force to release the fungus from the amphibian's grasp.

The most spectacular such discovery, the transparently named  Cueva de los Cristales , came in 2000. The crystals found there \u2014 at 300 metres' depth, a temperature of just under 60 \u00b0C and 100% humidity \u2014 are up to 11 metres long (see picture). Juan Manuel Garc\u00eda-Ruiz and colleagues suggest the very specific conditions that were required for such huge crystals to form (J. M. Garc\u00eda-Ruiz  et al .  Geology   35,  327\u2013330; 2007). Selenite is the colourless crystalline form of calcium sulphate dihydrate (CaSO 4 \u00b72H 2 O), better known as gypsum. Gypsum's solubility in water is highest at around 58 \u00b0C. Above that temperature, however, it is thermodynamically less stable than the anhydrous form of calcium sulphate, known simply as anhydrite. According to the authors' ideas, then, the ambient conditions of the  Cueva de los Cristales  would have been ideal for maintaining low-salinity cave-water slightly undersaturated in anhydrite (which would have originated from hydrothermal processes during the formation of the surrounding rock) and slightly supersaturated in gypsum over long periods. This tiny equilibrium imbalance would have encouraged the slow, sparse formation of very long gypsum crystals. The authors backed up their theory with various hydrochemical and geochemical analyses of samples from the cave. But they point out that the effulgent result of the unique natural circumstances that they describe might not be visible for future generations. The Naica mines today number among the most important for lead and silver in the world. Once their booty is exhausted, however, and water-pumping of the workings stops, nature might reclaim the  Cueva de los Cristales , reverting it to its erstwhile fully flooded state.

The internal structure and physics of stars such as our Sun, the physical conditions of the gas surrounding many hot stars in our Galaxy, and the workings of so-called active galactic nuclei are diverse areas of modern astrophysical research. Donald Osterbrock, who died on 11 January, made fundamentally important contributions to all of them, tackling their central questions with theoretical understanding and observational skill. Osterbrock was born in Cincinnati, Ohio, on 13 July 1924, the son of an electrical engineering professor. By high school, he had decided that he wanted to be an astronomer. After army service in the Second World War, he attended the University of Chicago, which was at the time not only a leading centre of physics research, but also possessed of a distinguished faculty of astronomers. The solid grounding in theory and observation that Osterbrock received from such renowned names as Enrico Fermi, Gregor Wentzel, Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar and Otto Struve was the foundation of his subsequent research career. His doctoral thesis, supervised by Chandrasekhar at Chicago's Yerkes Observatory, was a theoretical study of the dynamics of stars in galaxies as they interact gravitationally with a highly variable medium of stars, gas and dust. After completing his PhD in 1952, Osterbrock spent a year as a postdoctoral fellow at Princeton University, where the internal structure and evolution of stars was the subject of intensive study. He became interested in low-mass stars similar to the Sun, called red dwarfs, whose radii and luminosities were not correctly predicted by theoretical models of the time. Osterbrock reconciled theory and observation by proposing that it was convective energy transport, associated with bulk turbulent motions of gas \u2014 rather than heat radiation as was generally assumed \u2014 that transported the energy in the outer portions of these stars. Inspired by this success, Martin Schwarzschild and Fred Hoyle, another visitor to Princeton at this time, used the convection model to compute the first successful models of red-giant stars. In 1953, Osterbrock was invited to join the nascent astronomy department at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech), which had recently acquired a 200-inch-aperture telescope. Osterbrock's early observational research there included studies of the evolution of stars, both in 'globular clusters' found in the Milky Way and in nearby galaxies. But the future direction of his research was determined around this time by a paper from the theoretical astronomer Michael Seaton. This contained calculations of the interaction probabilities for electrons and oxygen ions, and Osterbrock used the theory to embark on an extended study of O +  and other ionic emissions from cosmic regions of ionized gas, or nebulae. In a short time, he had established himself as one of the world's leading authorities on gaseous nebulae. At Caltech, Osterbrock started supervising what was to become a long list of PhD students, many of whom went on to distinguished careers \u2014 four became directors of major observatories. In 1958, he moved to help create a first-class department of astronomy at the University of Wisconsin, Madison. Osterbrock and his students were able to use the modern equipment there to continue his studies of gaseous nebulae. The discovery in the early 1960s of quasars \u2014 a particularly luminous class of active galactic nucleus (AGN) radiating considerable amounts of energy from non-stellar sources \u2014 intensified interest in the study of external galaxies. The spectra of AGNs are often dominated by the same emission lines as those seen in gaseous nebulae, despite the physical conditions being clearly very different. Osterbrock was thus in an ideal position to unravel the mysteries of the poorly understood AGNs. Such research dominated the rest of his career, and he wrote a classic textbook on the subject,  Astrophysics of Gaseous Nebulae and Active Galactic Nuclei , now in its third edition. In 1973, Osterbrock became director of the Lick Observatory, headquartered on the University of California's Santa Cruz campus. One attraction held by the observatory was a 3-metre-aperture telescope fitted with a highly advanced electronic spectrograph that was ideally suited for Osterbrock's AGN research. During this time, assisted by a string of excellent students, he considerably expanded the classification scheme for different types of AGN, and also steadily improved physical and geometrical models of their structure. Although Osterbrock carefully reserved about half of his time for research, he took his directorial responsibilities very seriously. During his tenure, the Lick Observatory went through a phase of rapid advances in instrumentation, culminating in the project to build a 10-metre-aperture telescope on a 'dark' site farther away from human light pollution. Two competing designs emerged, one with a primary mirror made of a single, thin meniscus of glass, and the other with a primary mirror made up of a mosaic of segments. The meniscus mirror would have been fairly straightforward to produce, whereas the mosaic mirror was more challenging, but weighed less. Each approach had strong supporters, and Osterbrock skilfully led the process that arrived at a choice: a segmented-mirror telescope. The result was the construction of the two Keck telescopes on Mauna Kea, Hawaii, the largest optical/infrared telescopes presently available. Osterbrock felt uncomfortable with the administrative demands of leading the Lick Observatory when a major new observatory was being built, and he stepped down as director in 1981 to return to full-time teaching and research. In his later years, and especially following his retirement in 1991, he made a second name for himself as a historian of astronomy, writing several highly regarded biographies and histories of the Lick and Yerkes observatories. In 2004, a three-day symposium in honour of Osterbrock's eightieth birthday attracted astronomers and historians of the subject from far afield to Santa Cruz, many of them former students and colleagues. Don Osterbrock was the most sociable of scientists, and the animated discussions at the gathering's coffee breaks and lunches, with him at the centre and frequently punctuated with laughter, will be remembered by the unusually large number of close friends he had gained throughout the world.

It's received wisdom that the bigger a city is, the faster life moves; Luis Bettencourt and colleagues supply some empirical evidence to back up that perception ( Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA   104,  7301\u20137306; 2007). The authors begin by examining how different indicators of cities' activity and infrastructure scale with their size. They use various sets of data from the United States, China and Germany, and characterize the scalings as power laws of the form (population) n . They find that indicators of economic activity \u2014 from personal income, to patent registrations, to total electricity consumption \u2014 vary with population with values of  n  in the range 1.1\u20131.3, regardless of where the data were collected. In other words, cities the world over become more hyperactive the larger they get. Perhaps as a corollary to that excess, the prevalence of crime and sexually transmitted disease grows similarly quickly. Infrastructure indicators such as the lengths of the road and electricity networks, by contrast, scale to around (population) 0.8 . The larger the metropolis, the less of these things each citizen has at their disposal. Thus it seems that cities fulfill two basic needs of modern human society: they facilitate the exchange of ideas and, by extension, wealth creation; and they achieve economies of scale in the supply of a population's needs. To look at how these very different dynamics affect city expansion over time, Bettencourt  et al . construct a general equation that models the cost on resources of sustaining and increasing a population. Unsurprisingly, growth driven by the demands of efficiency,  n  < 1, stagnates after time: economies of scale eventually hit a bottom line. City growth driven by wealth creation ( n  > 1), on the other hand, rapidly becomes hyperexponential. The only way to avoid collapse as a population outstrips the finite resources available to it is through constant waves of innovation. These effectively re-engineer the initial conditions of growth. But the greater the absolute population, the smaller the relative return on each such investment \u2014 so new ideas must come ever faster. The city dweller looking for a quiet life is thus hit with a double whammy: the bigger the city, the faster life is; but the rate at which life gets faster must itself accelerate to maintain the city as a going concern. In biological organisms, the authors note, the situation is completely different. Larger organisms have greater economies of scale, and slower-paced lives. Metabolic rates, for example, increase with (body mass) 0.75 . With the city, it seems, mankind has created an organism operating beyond the bounds of what is natural. Reprints and Permissions"},

But the power of  Drosophila  genetics, together with previous studies pointing to sophisticated behavioural responses in this organism, in fact makes it an ideal choice for studying how our minds wander. Bruno van Swinderen suspended flies in a cylindrical arena with rotating walls on which one of two simple visual stimuli was displayed (B. van Swinderen  Science   315,  1590\u20131593; 2007). He found that, each time the stimuli were switched, the fly's local field potential (LFP) activity \u2014 a measure of the total electrical activity at the junctions between neurons \u2014 increased. When the same object was displayed on both sides of the rotating cylinder there was no increased LFP response when it appeared anew. This ruled out the possibility that the elevated LFP response to a second object was simply due to a startle reflex. When alternating the two visual stimuli, van Swinderen found that an interval of at least 50 seconds was required since the flies last saw the object for that stimulus to regain its novelty value, as measured by increased LFP activity. This response lasted an average of 9 seconds before the object lost its salience once more. The author next performed these tests on two fly mutants \u2014  dunce  and  rutabaga . The proteins encoded by these genes normally alter levels of the same molecule, cAMP, and the mutants show similar defects in short-term memory. Van Swinderen found that the LFP activity in the brains of these mutants did not fluctuate appropriately in response to novel visual stimuli. Might it simply be that the general responsiveness to visual cues is defective in these mutants? Surprisingly, the answer seems to be no. Van Swinderen found not only that visual responsiveness was unaffected, but also that, following an initial delay, it was in fact far higher in the  dunce  mutants than in normal flies. Further experiments confirmed that although the mutant flies responded normally to visual stimuli, they were defective in identifying a new stimulus. These results highlight the importance of the ability not just to pay attention, but also to divert it when necessary. The excessive responsiveness of the mutant flies to one visual stimulus seems to compromise short-term-memory activities such as shifting attention, or simultaneously paying attention, to another object. When the product of the  dunce  gene, the enzyme cAMP phosphodiesterase, was expressed throughout brain development, the attention defects associated with the mutation were overcome. This indicates that the developmental activity of cAMP is crucial for characteristics resembling attention in adult flies. Further analysis of both gene and enzyme should improve our understanding of what it takes to grab flies' \u2014 and perhaps humans' \u2014 attention. Reprints and Permissions"},

Alan MacDiarmid, who died on 7 February, was a pioneer of the field of intrinsically conducting polymers. He was born on 14 April 1927 in Masterton on the North Island of New Zealand. His Nobel autobiography describes a relatively frugal upbringing in a loving and generous family. When extra guests were invited back to the MacDiarmid home for a welcoming meal, the family was instructed to \u201cFHB\u201d \u2014 family hold back \u2014 while the guests were fed first. This isolated and caring Antipodean environment shaped a generosity of spirit in MacDiarmid that was appreciated by all who came into close contact with him. MacDiarmid left high school aged 16 and put himself through the then Victoria University College, Wellington, studying part-time while working as a lab boy. A Fulbright scholarship to the University of Wisconsin followed, where he completed a PhD under Norris Hall, and then won a New Zealand Shell scholarship to work on silicon hydrides with Harry Emel\u00e9us at the University of Cambridge, UK. With characteristic modesty, MacDiarmid described this opportunity as one he could not miss, even though it meant his studying for a second PhD. The terms of the scholarship also demanded that he remained single; eventually, however, he was able to marry Marian Mathieu in the chapel of Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge. After a brief spell at the University of St Andrews, UK, MacDiarmid entered the chemistry department at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia in 1964, where he remained essentially until his death. There, he met the condensed-matter physicist Alan Heeger, who suggested a collaboration on conductors that he described as SNX. These were inorganic covalent materials containing sulphur and nitrogen, (SN) x . MacDiarmid was initially unimpressed, assuming that everyone would know that metallic tin, (Sn) x , was conducting. The encounter led to collaboration and lifelong friendship, culminating in the award of the 2000 Nobel Prize in Chemistry to Heeger, MacDiarmid and Hideki Shirakawa. Shirakawa's involvement was serendipitous: MacDiarmid had presented a seminar on conducting (SN) x  materials at the Tokyo Institute of Technology in 1975, which Shirakawa did not attend because (SN) x  was not his area, and he had missed the 'conducting' qualifier. Meeting after the seminar, Shirakawa showed MacDiarmid a silvery film that he had prepared by polymerizing acetylene, C 2 H 2 , in a toluene solvent with differing ratios of catalyst. Realizing the significance of this 'polyacetylene', MacDiarmid invited Shirakawa back to Philadelphia, soliciting funding support from Kenneth Wynne at the US Office of Naval Research. This funding decision was surely one of the most far-sighted of the period. Together at Pennsylvania, MacDiarmid and Shirakawa first investigated improving the conductivity of polyacetylene by washing out impurities \u2014 but the purer the polymer became, the lower was its conductivity. They next tried to modify the polyacetylene with bromine, as had been done with (SN) x , and observed an increase in conductivity. But it was when, in collaboration with Heeger and his group, they tried iodine that the real surprise came. Astoundingly, the iodine-doped polyacetylene showed a conductivity of 30 siemens per centimetre, an increase of seven orders of magnitude over the undoped material. The first conducting polymer had been produced. Until that point, polymers had been regarded as excellent insulators, and the work changed the way scientists thought about plastics. Enormous interest in conducting and semiconducting polymers immediately followed. Improved and elegant precursor routes to polyacetylene were developed, and its conductivity was increased to a level almost as good as that of metallic copper, around 10 5  S cm 1 . All sorts of optoelectronic applications \u2014 transistors, solar cells and polymer light-emitting devices \u2014 have been the result. When Heeger moved to Santa Barbara in 1982, MacDiarmid continued fruitful collaborations with many others, opening up the field of polyanilines and related stable, soluble conducting polymers with controllable properties. During his scientific career, he influenced many people with his enthusiastic and enquiring approach, and his generosity of spirit. That warmth extended not just to his close collaborators: he was always to be seen at conferences asking a speaker or a student presenting a poster an encouraging question that made them feel good about their work. Although he lived and worked in the United States, Alan MacDiarmid treasured his Antipodean roots. He loyally supported science throughout the Asia\u2013Pacific region: in New Zealand, where his achievements were honoured with the naming of the MacDiarmid Institute for Advanced Materials and Nanotechnology in Wellington; in Australia, where he chaired the international advisory committee for the University of Wollongong's Centre of Excellence in Electromaterials Science; and in China, through the MacDiarmid Laboratory at Jilin University. In the last four years of his life, he held two positions, at Pennsylvania and the University of Texas, Dallas, where his attention increasingly turned to climate change, and particularly the use of biofuels. Alan enjoyed life to the full. At the biennial International Conference on Synthetic Metals, of which he was a founding member, and at many other international events, he could be relied on to demonstrate his version of the  haka , an indigenous New Zealand war dance. MacDiarmid \u2014 pictured here with his Nobel medal at the University of Wollongong in 2001 \u2014 was a recipient of many honours in his later life. He was appointed as one of the only 20 concurrently living members of the Order of New Zealand in 2001, and was a member of the US National Academy of Sciences and a fellow of the Royal Society of London. In 2002, he received an honorary doctorate from the University of Cambridge, and was inducted an honorary fellow of Sidney Sussex College in the chapel where he was first married. Marian, Alan's wife from that marriage, died in 1990. After a 14-year courtship he was married again, to Gayl Gentile, with whom many of Alan's scientific colleagues have also become affectionate friends. He is survived by Gayl, three daughters and a son from his first marriage, and nine grandchildren. Reprints and Permissions"},

Interest in the insect world is shown to a greater extent by Tennyson, for he alludes to it frequently, and always with the accuracy which reveals great knowledge... Tennyson's love of geology is apparent in the frequent references to it and the similes he gives, which clearly show he must have read a good deal on this as indeed on many other less popular subjects; for instance, he does not shun allusions to the nebular hypothesis, spectrum analysis, and astronomy. It seems evident that he accepted the theory of evolution, for many quotations might be made to show it... \u201cEvolution ever climbing after some ideal good,\u00a0And reversion ever dragging Evolution in the mud.\u201d From  Nature  21 March 1907.

Lippard"}], "parsed_as_year": "2006_or_before", "body": "Inorganic chemist, educator and discoverer of the quadruple bond. Among the greatest thrills for a scientist are those that occur at the moment of discovery. For a chemist, discovery is often synonymous with the creation of a new molecule in the laboratory. But understanding can be an even higher calling: the ability to recognize and explain properties of matter that others have previously encountered but could not comprehend. From understanding, one can derive new principles with which to interpret, or even predict, future results. Few individuals have contributed as much to inorganic chemistry through both discovery and understanding as Frank Albert Cotton. His death on 20 February, at the age of 76, marks the end of an extraordinary and prolific career. The signature discovery to emerge from Cotton's laboratory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) came in the early 1960s. This was a time of renaissance in coordination chemistry \u2014 the study of metal\u2013ligand complexes \u2014 and it was fuelled by the rediscovery of a theoretical model known as crystal field theory. Cotton and his colleagues applied this theory in their search for transition-metal complexes with unusual spin states and magnetic properties. They obtained rhenium compounds of relatively low oxidation state in which the distances between adjacent metal atoms were shorter than in the bulk metal itself. The geometry of the simple [Re 2 Cl 8 ] 2\u2212  ion was especially noteworthy. In this ion, an extremely short metal\u2013metal bond of just 2.27 \u00c5 linked two {ReCl 4 \u2212 } fragments, with no additional bridging ligand. Moreover, the two halves of the dimer were in an 'eclipsed' configuration, with the chlorine atoms on either side swept back to a separation of about 3.5 \u00c5 to avoid non-bonded repulsions between them. For some reason, the unit adopted this geometry rather than avoiding such a steric clash by rotating one half of the dimer by 45\u00b0. Cotton quickly understood the importance of this result. It meant that there was a quadruple bond in the [ReRe 2 Cl 8 ] 2\u2212  ion, the first to be identified. In addition to one \u03c3 and two \u03c0 bonds between the rhenium atoms, as occurs in the triple bond between two nitrogen atoms in the N\u2261N molecule, there was an additional linkage, known as a \u03b4 bond. Formation of this bond required the chlorine atoms to adopt the eclipsed geometry. Like all ground-breaking ideas in science, the consequences of this insight were profound. The finding that chemical compounds could have such multiply bonded metal\u2013metal units launched a whole branch of inorganic chemistry and, later, materials science that kept Cotton's laboratory and others across the world occupied in the ensuing decades. Both experimentalists and theorists recognized the importance of this rich new vein of chemistry. An essential tool in the structural characterization of metal\u2013metal-bonded compounds was X-ray crystallography. Cotton applied this technique so prodigiously, and advocated its more general use in structure determination so effectively, that it became a routine tool for investigating any chemical substance for which suitable single crystals could be obtained. With remarkable energy and creativity, the Cotton laboratory turned out a stunning display of compounds with double, triple and quadruple metal\u2013metal bonds spanning many of the elements of the transition-metal series. By counting electrons, one could predict the character of many of these new creations \u2014 a remarkable achievement. But Cotton's contributions were not limited to these metal-cluster compounds. In a series of imaginative studies, he and his colleagues prepared and investigated the physical and chemical properties of organometallic complexes. Many of these compounds contained carbon\u2013carbon double bonds that were linked to one or more transition-metal ions. To clarify their structures, Cotton invented the 'hapto' or nomenclature now used to indicate the number of carbon atoms bonded to a given metal atom. Using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, typically applied to solutions of compounds over a temperature range, Cotton and his co-workers mapped out the relative motions of 'fluxional' organometallics, in which metal ions and organic fragments are involved in an elaborate intramolecular dance. They thus created fascinating motion pictures of movements within these complexes, and their studies were soon followed up by many laboratories. If a scientist's achievements can be measured by his or her ability to inspire the work of others, Cotton ranks with the very best twentieth-century chemists. Al Cotton was a champion of fundamental research. His passions were learning, uncovering the secrets of nature and creating new molecules. As an adviser to the US government while a member of the National Science Board, and in other arenas, he championed the cause of funding basic research that is driven purely by intellectual curiosity, rather than by the latest fads in applying chemistry to its many sister disciplines in the life sciences and in engineering. Cotton was also an extraordinary educator, writing textbooks at levels ranging from high school to advanced graduate, on topics from elementary and advanced inorganic chemistry to the application of group theory. These texts have been translated into many languages, and in total have sold more than a million copies. At MIT, and subsequently at Texas A&M University, he mentored well over 100 PhD students, and his laboratory was a popular training-ground for numerous postdocs and sabbatical visitors representing 30 countries. Al took a deep personal interest in his postdoctoral and PhD students. I myself recall his wise advice about my future career choices when, as I was nearing the end of my graduate days in his lab at MIT, we were riding on horseback one beautiful autumn day near his home southwest of Boston. At that moment, and at many others spanning more than four decades, I was the beneficiary of his counsel and support, as were many others. His life in itself was an inspiration that taught the benefits and joys that reward hard work, deep thinking and the search for unexplored frontiers. Reprints and Permissions"},

Our immediate concern is with the most distinguished of the eminent triumvirate\u2014Dmitri Ivanovitsch Mendel\u00e9eff...he was a Siberian, born at Tobolsk on February 7 th  (N.S.), 1834. He died, therefore, within a week of his seventy-third birthday. He was the seventeenth and youngest child of Ivan Paolowitch Mendel\u00e9eff... The story of the rise and development of the Periodic Law is so well known that it is unnecessary now to dwell upon it. By a good fortune, which some may regard as evidence of predestination, Mendel\u00e9eff lived to see the verification of his predictions in the discovery, in rapid succession, of gallium, scandium and germanium; and no seer ever prophesied more truthfully.

The book states that the Russian atom bomb project started in 1937.

This quantified errors in timing and in pitch interval (misjudging the jumps between notes) and contour (going the wrong way on the scale). Pitch and timing consistency were assessed by comparing variations in pitch and deviations from the prescribed tempo ( rubato ) in a repeated phrase in the song's chorus. Unsurprisingly, the professional participants \u2014 among them Gilles Vigneault, the composer and original vocalist of  Gens du pays  \u2014 scored better.

But the best of these are difficult to make, and can be very fragile. Steven Bell and colleagues now describe a simple method to prepare robust superhydrophobic surfaces of high quality (I. A. Larmour  et al .  Angew. Chem. Int. Edn  doi:10.1002/anie.200604596; 2007). The secret of lotus leaves' water-repellency is the double roughness of their surfaces \u2014 caused by the presence of nanohairs on microbumps \u2014 coupled with a waxy coating. The authors recreate this double roughness by coating metal substrates with a textured layer of another metal, simply by immersing them in a metal-salt solution. Scanning electron microscopy shows that the deposited metal forms flower-like structures (0.20 to 1 \u00b5m across) that are made up of smaller crystallites (about 60 to 200 nm in size), simulating the complexity of lotus leaf surfaces. Dipping the substrates in a solution of a chemical surface-modifier, HDFT, supplies a monolayer of hydrophobic molecules. These molecules are highly fluorinated, just like the Teflon lining of non-stick frying-pans. The resulting surfaces show almost perfect super-hydrophobicity: a drop of water on a perfectly water-repellent surface forms a contact angle \u03b8 of 180\u00b0, and the surfaces produced by this method have \u03b8 values consistently greater than 170\u00b0. The approach is so simple that it can be applied to metal objects of any reasonable size or shape. The authors again turned to nature for inspiration. Pond skaters ( Gerridae ) use superhydrophobic legs to walk on water. Bell and colleagues made a model pond skater from copper (pictured), with legs that had been treated with silver and HDFT. Despite having ten times the mass of a real pond skater, the metallic insect was able to rest comfortably on the surface of water. The authors suggest that their method will aid research into superhydrophobic surfaces. This should hasten the arrival of practical applications, such as reducing turbulent flow in water-bearing pipes. Reprints and Permissions"},

The opportunity was offered by the colony in the ventilation holes in the tower of the University Museum at Oxford (associated in memory with the historic debate on evolution between Huxley and Wilberforce); it was ingeniously taken, by the insertion of nesting boxes with lids and glass panels to study the birds at closest quarters from within the tower. Many ornithologists and others have climbed the tall interior ladders to see the birds, which are unafraid of approach in these circumstances; but it is to many hours of patient observation by the author, and by his wife and other assistants, that we owe the wealth of information now presented in such attractive form.

The remains of these hapless animals, in this and two associated caves, constitute a palaeontological bounty for understanding past conditions in the region during the middle Pleistocene. The discoveries and their environmental context are described by Gavin Prideaux and colleagues elsewhere in this issue (G. J. Prideaux  et al .  Nature   445 , 422\u2013425; 2007). The small entrance to Leaena's Breath cave was the undoing of a large number of mammals and reptiles. They evidently fell through this hole, dropping some 20 metres to the cave floor. If they were not killed by their injuries, they later died of thirst. By far the commonest remains are fossils of various marsupials such as wombats, opossums and especially kangaroos; many species of these animals were previously not known, and many did not survive the Pleistocene. Prideaux  et al . applied a battery of techniques to date the fossils and the layers in which they were buried. Their results produce ages ranging between 780,000 and 200,000 years ago. The Nullarbor plain is vast and empty, and today appears as it is in this photograph: flat, dry, shrubby and almost treeless. From their analyses of isotope ratios in samples of herbivore tooth enamel, both ancient and modern, and the faunal composition, the authors conclude that in the past the Nullarbor had a more diverse flora, and a mixture of woods and shrubland that contained more plants with palatable leaves and fruits. But given that the species that did become extinct seem to have been as well adapted to dry conditions as those that did not, the authors also think the environment was as arid then as it is now. Instead of invoking climate change, that common suspect, they argue that the best explanation for the different flora was an increased incidence of bushfires.

But their electromagnetic fields are, like light, a quantum object whose energy comes in discrete units \u2014 photons. Both a coherent light beam and thermal, 'black-body' radiation given out by a heat source are archetypal, classical electromagnetic fields. Such fields can for most purposes satisfactorily be described as waves within the classical theory of electromagnetism formulated by James Clerk Maxwell in the 1860s. But even classical electromagnetic fields have an inherent quantum nature. That much is amply demonstrated by the experiments of Schuster  et al . 1 , set out on  page 515  of this issue, which measure the statistics of photons in microwave electromagnetic fields confined within the solidly classical surroundings of an electrical circuit. Quantum physics owes its origin to Max Planck's postulation in 1900 of the existence of discrete quanta of energy, which were needed to formulate a consistent theory of black-body radiation. Albert Einstein, too, in his  annus mirabilis  of 1905, observed that quantizing light \u2014 dividing it up into discrete packets of energy known as photons \u2014 could help to explain the photoelectric effect 2 . Since then, countless experiments have confirmed that electromagnetic fields are fundamentally quantized. The quantum theory of coherence, introduced by Roy Glauber in the 1960s, has provided a deeper insight into photonic systems 3 . Within this framework, even classical coherent and thermal fields can be described in terms of quantum-mechanical concepts such as phase properties and photon statistics. In a coherent field, the photonic quantum state has a well-defined phase; in an incoherent, thermal field, the phase information is distributed randomly. But on the macroscopic scale \u2014 the scale of, for example, an electrical circuit \u2014 a quantum-mechanical description of electrodynamics has a fundamental credibility problem. Its probabilistic tenets simply seem irreconcilable with our everyday intuition. For that reason, quantum theories generally tend to be perceived as a theory of only the small and invisible: of photons in free space, and of atoms and molecules. Schuster and colleagues' work 1  builds on research performed on superconducting circuits, and provides crucial verification that quantum electrodynamics indeed has a role at a macroscopic scale in our everyday life. Their advance uses powerful tools, mainly developed by them earlier 4 , that are inspired by a pivotal innovation known as cavity quantum electrodynamics. Here, an electromagnetic field is confined inside a resonator as standing waves with discrete frequencies. This allows the study of the interaction between the quantized field and the atoms in the resonator. Major tests, such as the generation and detection of non-classical states, have been performed on electromagnetic fields of microwave wavelengths (in the range of centimetres) confined in such three-dimensional cavities 5 , 6 . The authors' technique uses a microwave field that is not confined in three dimensions in air, as in a standard cavity, but is guided and defined in a one-dimensional, coplanar waveguide \u2014 a refined, on-chip version of the coaxial cables common in conventional electronics. According to theory 7 , such guided waves are quantum fields similar to light. The equivalent of a cavity is defined by interrupting the waveguide with capacitors that prevent the electromagnetic wave passing. A Cooper-pair box, a tiny superconducting circuit consisting of a metallic island and a bigger electrode, plays the role of the atom with which the field interacts in a standard cavity (Fig. 2 on  page 516 ). The physics of this Cooper-pair box can be simplified as two quantum states that differ by a single pair of electrons on the island, and therefore in their electrical dipole moment, which is a measure of the distribution of charge. Because of the greater separation of the charges, the dipole moments involved are huge compared with those of real atoms. Added to the fact that the wave modes supported by the cavity are densely packed in small volumes, this means that the atom\u2013field coupling energy is high. Whereas Schuster and colleagues previously demonstrated just the coherent coupling of the atom and field 4 , they can thus now investigate the precise quantum character of the field. The authors measure 1  the associated quantum probabilities of the photon numbers in the resonator by imprinting information about the field state on the artificial atom, and then observing the atom reusing the radiation trapped in the cavity. When the artificial probe atom couples to the cavity far from the cavity's resonance frequency, the transition frequency between the atom's two quantum states is shifted \u2014 a phenomenon known as the a.c. Stark effect. If the field were completely classical, this frequency shift would be constant, and proportional to the square of the electrical field. But in the quantum world, the discreteness of the field energy and the probabilistic nature of the field state allow the frequency shift to have only certain values, which are proportional to the number of photons present in the cavity (Fig. 3 on  page 517 ). The height of the peaks corresponding to these frequency shifts reflects the probability of different numbers of photons in the cavity. If the cavity is exposed to a simulated source of thermal radiation, these probabilities follow Planck's thermal law (Fig. 4 on  page 517 ). If the cavity is coherently excited, one obtains a Poisson distribution, as emerges from Glauber's theory of coherence. For sceptics looking for possible loopholes in quantum theory, this proof of the quantum nature of the confined microwave field is the start of a new generation of tests of its non-classicality. Beyond the significance this set-up has for the foundations of quantum physics on the macroscopic scale, it opens up new perspectives in quantum measurement and its potential use in quantum information processing. The complete measurement of the quantum field \u2014 not only photon statistics, but also phase information \u2014 is a logical next step, and could be achieved by applying a powerful method known as quantum homodyne tomography. But implementing that technique in the microwave domain will require further work and fresh ideas owing to the lack of effective photodetectors for microwave light 8 . These kinds of precise measurement would be easier if the field to be measured were separated from the field that does the measuring 9 , and the fact that they are combined is a weakness of Schuster and colleagues' current set-up. The next step is to prepare and verify other genuine quantum objects, such as single microwave photons, entangled multimode fields, and single- and two-mode squeezed states. Schuster and colleagues' work 1 , 4  is sparking many theoretical proposals on how to achieve all this, and more. With such impetus, quantum optics on a chip could soon emerge as an exciting new subdiscipline of physics. Reprints and Permissions"},

Such trains, it was shown, form a fast vehicle in the race for the great prize \u2014 fertilization of an egg. But only one sperm can be successful in that goal. Simone Immler and colleagues have now revisited the question of what prompts the selfless behaviour of the others ( PloS One  doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0000170; 2007). A feature of the sperm of wood mice and many of their relatives among the murine rodents is that their heads carry a hook structure, which varies in shape and size between species, as shown in the picture. Immler  et al . carried out a survey of the sperm of 37 species of murine rodent. They find that hook shape and curvature are more pronounced in species in which the female is more likely to mate with different males. The principle of 'together we succeed, divided we fail' makes sense in this situation. These sperm are better equipped to cooperate: so those from any one male are better able to see off the competition from another male. The authors also looked at the behaviour of sperm in two of the species, the Norway rat and the house mouse. In both, the sperm formed groups. But in the house mouse, individual sperm outperformed the group in sheer speed. Immler  et al . speculate that maybe speed isn't everything: perhaps in this case the group can make surer progress in the journey up the female reproductive tract. And there remains the issue of competition among the collaborators: who gets to claim the envied job of fertilization? Reprints and Permissions"},

The discussions were brought to the attention of the Secretary of State for War, Mr. Stimson, who appointed a representative 'Interim Committee' to advise him. At this point General Marshall stated that he would advise against its use in the war provided its existence could be kept secret. The general opinion was, however, that it would not be possible to keep its existence secret. A proposal to make a non-military demonstration likely to bring an end to the war was also thought to be impossible. After this, a poll of a hundred scientists of the Metallurgical Laboratory brought an 87 per cent vote in favour of its military use. The decision was taken by President Truman on the advice of Mr. Stimson...

Shouldn't the same action executed under the same conditions always produce the same result? Yet even professional darts players, throwing in a controlled indoor environment and standing a set distance from the board, can miss the bull's-eye. Many theories of muscle control have assumed that such errors arise from variation generated during the movement \u2014 particularly 'noise' in the way that neurons pass instructions to the muscles at the neuromuscular junction. But Mark Churchland, Afsheen Afshar and Krishna Shenoy report that a large part of the problem could instead arise as the brain plans the action ( Neuron   52 , 1085\u20131096; 2006). They observed monkeys reaching for visual targets that appeared on a screen. When a target first appeared, it jittered slightly in place, and the animals were trained not to reach for it until it became stationary a half-second to a second later \u2014 allowing a period of preparation. The authors recorded neural activity from the motor cortex and the premotor cortex, two brain regions involved in movement planning and execution. Comparing the monkeys' reaching movements with these recordings, they found that variations in the velocity of the reaches correlated with fluctuations in brain activity during the preparatory period \u2014 hundreds of milliseconds before the movement started. So it seems that the execution of even a simple, well-practised task is limited by the brain's ability to plan the same movement over and over again. Indeed, Churchland and colleagues estimate that this constraint could account for at least half of the variability in the monkeys' movements. Whether the fluctuations they observe actually arise in the premotor and motor cortex, or merely reflect variations elsewhere in the brain, is still an open question. And how variations in sensory input might affect the subsequent movement has yet to be fully explored. Finding the answers will have implications for our understanding of how the brain controls movement, and in the long term could have an impact on how movement disorders are treated.

Linder"}], "parsed_as_year": "2006_or_before", "body": "The deepest and clearest maps yet of the Universe's skeleton of dark-matter structure present a picture broadly in concord with favoured models \u2014 although puzzling discrepancies remain. Astronomers use every resource at their disposal to construct an image of the Universe: from the microwave radiation of the cooling Big Bang, past the visible wavelengths of light seen by the casual viewer of the night sky, to the \u03b3-rays of the most powerful explosions of collapsing stars and ravenous black holes. They don't even have to see an object directly to detect its presence. In a manner akin to the Polynesian seafarers who sense islands out of their sight through the deflected direction of ocean waves, cosmologists can map a concentration of the Universe's unseen mass through the gravitational deflection of light coming from sources behind it. On  page 286  of this issue 1 , Massey  et al . publish the latest and most detailed atlas of these 'dark-matter' congregations Footnote  1 . Dark matter is thought to comprise as-yet undiscovered elementary particles, and is a central prediction of the current 'concordance' model of the Universe's make-up. Here, it acts as a skeleton around which bright matter \u2014 galaxies and clusters of galaxies \u2014 assembles. There is abundant indirect evidence for structures made of dark matter. The gravitational deflection, or lensing, technique has already been used to make maps of dark matter around individual galaxies and clusters, most dramatically by Clowe  et al . 2 . Low-resolution reconstructions of the skeleton of a larger chunk of the nearby Universe have also been carried out using ground-based telescopes. Massey  et al . 1  present an analysis of gravitational-lensing data from the Cosmic Evolution Survey, COSMOS, that were acquired using the Hubble Space Telescope. These data cover an area of sky about eight times the size of the full Moon, and represent the first wide-sky, space-based survey of dark matter. This is a great step forward, as observations from space avoid the distortions and time variations that Earth's atmosphere imposes on the astronomical signal. (The effect of these perturbations is rather as though our seafarer friend had to contend with a nearby canoe's paddlers roiling the ocean when studying his waves.) The new maps consequently have a much higher resolution than the best ground-based observations, with four times the density of sources than in previous studies. They also go deeper into the Universe, looking back to a time when the Universe was about half the age it is now, at a redshift  z =1. (The redshift is a measure of the expansion of the Universe; the higher the redshift of a cosmological object, the smaller and younger the Universe was when the object sent out its signal.) To assess the third dimension of their map, the depth of the field of view, astronomers cannot move their canoe and use triangulation. They rely instead on mathematics to derive the distance of the gravitational lens by means of its focal length \u2014 which is known from Einstein's general theory of relativity \u2014 and the distance to the background source galaxy whose light is probing the dark matter. Massey  et al . combine the COSMOS observations with follow-up observations from ground-based telescopes in 15 wavelength bands, and so are able to estimate redshifts of the galaxy sources all the way back to  z =3, when the Universe was just a sixth of its present age. With this information, the pattern of dark-matter concentrations can be mapped crudely in three dimensions by slicing the data into three redshift shells. Although this is just a first step in 'cosmic tomography', the advantage of using a space telescope is that the source density in each slice of this three-dimensional map is nearly as high as for the 'unsliced' maps \u2014 two-dimensional projections \u2014 expected from the next generation of ground-based surveys. Massey and colleagues' three-dimensional map can be studied on its own merits to provide information about the pattern and evolution of dark-matter structures, or can be compared with observations of the bright matter through visible light and X-rays. The dark-matter distribution shows modest evidence for a connected, filamentary distribution \u2014 exactly the kind of skeleton predicted by concordance cosmology for stars and galaxies to assemble around. A note of caution, however: it is still early days, and spurious noise affects the weaker features in the map (at the level of around 2.9 standard deviations). There are also striking examples of both beautiful agreement and puzzling disagreement between the dark and bright maps. Areas bright in X-rays, indicating the highest concentrations of gas heated by falling into the strongest gravitational fields, almost always overlap with the dark-matter concentrations \u2014 but not absolutely always. Conversely, dark-matter concentrations sometimes seem to have no corresponding bright matter. For the dark-matter skeleton of mass in the Universe, flesh sometimes occurs without supporting bones, and bones without surrounding flesh. That is perfectly possible. However, these data, together with forthcoming ground-based data from the lower-resolution, but wider-area Canada\u2013France\u2013Hawaii Telescope Legacy Survey 3 , will need to be carefully compared with computational simulations of the Universe to analyse consistencies and discrepancies. Cosmologists are getting a foretaste of a new ability to map the dark Universe, despite the fact that the gravitational-lens mapping technique is still showing some growing pains: even the Hubble Space Telescope observations required significant corrections, because of radiation damage to the detectors. Radiation-resistant detectors have already been developed for a proposed space mission, the Supernova/Acceleration Probe (SNAP) 4 , that would extend COSMOS-type maps of the dark-matter skeleton to an area 2,500 times larger than that covered by Massey  et al . 1 . These maps would also be both deeper and more finely resolved. But for now, the COSMOS data give astronomers an exciting new view of the dark Universe. Reprints and Permissions"},

Even at the four-cell stage, embryonic cells that follow a particular pattern of division already have their developmental fate assigned to them. No cell will contribute exclusively to a specific cell type in the later embryo. But the progeny of some cells make a greater contribution to the 'inner cell mass' \u2014 the stem cells destined to become the fetus \u2014 and its surrounding 'trophectoderm', which forms extraembryonic structures such as the placenta. The progeny of other cells will make a greater contribution to other extraembryonic structures. Reporting on  page 214  of this issue, Maria-Elena Torres-Padilla and colleagues find that the key to the cells' destiny lies, at least in part, outside their genes (M.-E. Torres-Padilla  et al .  Nature   445 , 214\u2013218; (2007). To fit into the nucleus, DNA is wound around histone proteins. Both the DNA and the histones can be studded with a variety of additional chemical groups \u2014 notably, methyl groups \u2014 that affect how tightly the structure is packed. These 'epigenetic marks' determine how accessible the genes in certain regions are, and they can interact directly with gene regulatory factors to activate or silence nearby genes. Specific patterns of these marks are associated with particular cell fates in later stages of development, and with allowing stem cells to maintain the ability to develop into many different cell types (pluripotency). So Torres-Padilla  et al . speculated that epigenetic instructions might also help to determine the fate of early embryonic cells. The authors concentrated on an epigenetic mark related to gene activation \u2014 methylation of an arginine amino acid in the histone H3 protein. They looked for differences between the cells destined for different fates in mouse embryos. An embryo is pictured here at the 32-cell stage, with the inner cell mass shown in red and the two types of trophectoderm, polar and mural, shown in blue and green respectively. In the four-cell embryo, methylation of H3 was highest in cells that were due to become the inner cell mass and polar trophectoderm, and lowest in cells destined to contribute to the mural trophectoderm. To see whether this epigenetic mark really affected developmental fate, the authors manipulated the cells to overexpress the enzyme that carries out arginine methylation in two-cell embryos. This caused all the cells' progeny to become part of the inner cell mass \u2014 and increased the expression of certain proteins associated with pluripotency. Epigenetic marks thus seem to be among the first developmental instructions that the embryonic cell receives. Reprints and Permissions"},

Work is needed on the stability of the memory storage, but it's a promising step towards some novel technological applications. The advent of non-volatile flash memory \u2014 semiconductor memory that does not lose its data when the power is turned off \u2014 revolutionized consumer electronics. It is now used to store the numbers in mobile phones, the pictures taken with digital cameras, and the music tracks in MP3 players. Similar types of memory based on organic semiconductors, rather than traditional silicon-based semiconductors, would make possible entirely new concepts: intelligent food packaging, for instance, that could be used by retailers to control their inventories and to alert consumers when the food is getting close to its 'use-by' date. Writing in  Advanced Materials , Baeg  et al . 1  describe an organic thin-film memory transistor that brings such intriguing possibilities a little closer. Two particular advantages of organic thin-film transistors over solid-state transistors are that they are simpler to make, and can be fabricated on thin, flexible plastic substrates. They could thus form the backbone of low-cost microelectronics ranging from radio-frequency identification tags to flexible, large-area active-matrix displays 2 . Many of these applications require non-volatile (stable) data storage, preferably with memory elements that can be programmed, erased and read electrically. Baeg and colleagues' transistor 1  not only fulfils these requirements, but can also, owing to its similar architecture, be simply integrated into existing technology based on organic transistors. In order to function as a memory, a device must be observed in two (or more) different states. In flash memories, this is achieved by introducing a second 'floating gate' to the silicon transistor between the normal control gate, which regulates the flow of current through the transistor, and the semiconducting substrate ( Fig. 1a ). This floating gate is insulated all around by an oxide layer. A high-voltage pulse applied to the control gate places charge on the floating gate, where it becomes trapped. This partially cancels out the electric field coming from the control gate, and so modifies the threshold voltage of the transistor \u2014 that is, the voltage required before it lets current flow. Thus, when the transistor is 'read' by placing a specific voltage on the control gate, electrical current will either flow or not flow, depending on the threshold voltage, and so the number of electrons on the floating gate. The resulting current level flowing through the transistor can be used to define boolean '0' and '1' memory states. The charge trapped on the floating gate persists long after all voltages are removed: the information is thus retained after power shutdown, and the transistor functions as a non-volatile memory device. The non-volatile memory technology developed by Baeg  et al . 1  takes a slightly different approach ( Fig. 1b ). Instead of charge being trapped on a floating gate, it is trapped locally on a thin layer of a chargeable polymer. This 'electret' is inserted between the insulating material (silicon dioxide) that makes up the gate and the organic semiconductor (which is pentacene, C 22 H 14 ). When a high-voltage pulse is applied to this electret, it charges up. Applying a reverse voltage pulse either decharges it, restoring the initial state, or charges it to the opposite polarity. The trapped charge imposes an added voltage on the threshold gate voltage, as a floating gate does in a flash memory. This too can be sensed and translated into '1's and '0's, reproducing the stored data, by measuring the current flowing through the transistor. Memory based on such organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) has been investigated before 3 , 4 , but Baeg  et al . 1  are the first to report programming speeds of around 1 microsecond \u2014 a million times faster than the previous best time of around a second. That marks a decisive step towards making organic memory technology fit for technological purposes. The new speed record is the result of fast and efficient charge transfer from the organic semiconductor into the polymer electret by means of the electric gate field. The gate field lowers the energy barrier at the interface of the semiconductor and the electret, and so facilitates charge transfer. Once transferred, most of the charge is trapped deeply in the electret. This model explains Baeg and colleagues' most important observations: a critical gate field, caused by the energy barrier, for transfer and trapping of the charges; the lowering of this critical field when the device is illuminated with visible light; a long retention time of the order of hours in the dark; and a decrease of the retention time upon illumination. These observations also indicate moot points. Can these devices reach data retention times necessary for practical applications \u2014 typically years for non-volatile memory? Furthermore, can the device be scaled down to more practical voltages \u2014 to 10 V from the 100 V used in the present work \u2014 without sacrificing device speed and stability? Such questions remain unanswered, but these encouraging results will without doubt spur intensive investigations into this approach. The relevance of these results could also go beyond the scope of just memory. Baeg and colleagues 1  aim to produce non-volatile memories that exploit charge trapping and storage, but others are concerned with the converse problem: eliminating charge trapping as much as possible where it gives rise to undesired shifts in threshold voltages that can suppress 'n-channel' (electron) mobility 5  in OFETs, and limit the operational lifetime of 'p-type' (electron-hole-based) logic circuitry 6 . Whatever the intent, all will benefit from a thorough understanding of charge-trapping effects at the crucial interface between a semiconductor and its gate. Reprints and Permissions"},

But their reaction to the 1918 influenza virus could have been deadly. The devastating Spanish influenza A virus infected around a third of the world's population during the pandemic of 1918. With mortality rates more than 25 times that of other influenza pandemics, the 1918 virus killed over 40 million people worldwide 1 . Influenza A virus is transmitted among humans and domestic animals, and when different strains infect the same cell, mixing of the two viral genomes (or 'reassortment') can generate new strains with epidemic or pandemic potential. Studies of genetically engineered influenza A viruses containing some or all of the genes from the 1918 virus suggest that this virus might have acquired a unique combination of genes that caused the disease's unusual severity 1 , 2 . However, the specific actions of these genes and their contribution to the virulence of the 1918 pandemic have remained elusive. On  page 319  of this issue, Kobasa  et al . 3  provide the first report of the effects of the reconstructed 1918 influenza virus in monkeys. Their findings link the unprecedented lethality of the 1918 pandemic virus to an aberrant innate immune response. During infection, an invading virus is recognized by specialized cellular proteins that engage viral nucleic acids or proteins and trigger signalling pathways within the infected cell. These pathways culminate in the production of molecules of the innate immune system \u2014 our first line of protection against infection \u2014 called \u03b1/\u03b2-interferons, proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines 4 . This group of proteins includes interleukins, which are essential for activating immune cells, and chemoattractant proteins, which recruit immune cells to sites of infection. The innate immune response is triggered over a course of minutes to hours after infection, and these secreted proteins act collectively, both locally and systemically, to direct the expression of a wide range of proteins that act directly against the virus or stimulate inflammation. However, unchecked or excessive stimulation of the innate immune response can be harmful. It can contribute to the virulence of pathogenic viruses, in part by causing excessive infiltration of the tissues by immune cells, resulting in tissue destruction 5 . Kobasa  et al . 3  conducted comparative virological and functional-genomic analyses of monkeys infected with either a contemporary influenza virus or the 1918 pandemic virus. Influenza virus strains are generally classified by the two proteins that vary most widely among them \u2014 haemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N). Both of the viruses in Kobasa and colleagues' study are of the H1N1 type, although they differ in their epidemiological and pathological properties because of variations in their other proteins. Analysis of the animals infected with the contemporary virus showed that the virus was present in only a small area of the respiratory tract, causing mild symptoms. Gene expression patterns in the cells lining the bronchus confirmed a robust innate immune response soon after infection. This response included the induction of \u03b1/\u03b2-interferons, cytokines and chemokines, but the expression of each of these proteins was transient and correlated directly with virus levels in the infected tissues. The authors therefore conclude that infection with contemporary H1N1 influenza virus elicits a transient but appropriate activation of innate immune defences that ultimately facilitates clearance of the virus and recovery. By comparison, the 1918 virus replicated to high levels and spread rapidly throughout the respiratory tract of infected animals. Lung tissue from these animals showed severe damage, including bleeding and infiltration of immune cells, at times well after the peak of virus replication. A whole-genome analysis of gene expression \u2014 the first in monkeys infected with the 1918 virus \u2014 showed that the virus triggered aberrantly high and sustained expression of genes encoding many proteins involved in the innate immune response, including proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines. So Kobasa  et al . 3  propose that an aberrant innate immune response to the 1918 influenza virus could be responsible for the rapid, severe outcome of the infection ( Fig. 1 ). Their data suggest that persistent elevation of inflammatory-response genes could account for the massive inflammation and infiltration of immune cells observed in the respiratory tract of animals infected with the 1918 virus. Notably, infection with contemporary influenza virus triggered robust expression of genes encoding several \u03b1-interferon subtypes and of interferon-stimulated genes with known antiviral properties, and this expression was associated with the comparative mildness of the disease. By contrast, the 1918 virus induced only low and selective expression of genes encoding \u03b1-interferon subtypes and differential expression of many interferon-stimulated genes \u2014 including one that encodes a protein called RIG-I. Contemporary influenza A virus triggers innate immune defences in part through RIG-I, which regulates the expression of other immune and inflammation genes 6 . But tissue infected with the 1918 virus showed reduced RIG-I expression compared with tissue infected with the contemporary virus. Although these observations may conceptually link RIG-I activity to intracellular pathways that would normally induce the production of interleukins and chemoattractants to clear the virus, the study lacks the biochemical data that are essential for defining such connections. Kobasa  et al . 3  demonstrate the power of functional genomics in untangling the complexities of virus\u2013host interactions and viral pathogenesis. Their gene-expression profile analyses suggest that the 1918 virus triggers innate immune signalling processes that possess altered kinetics relative to the contemporary influenza A virus, and/or that the 1918 virus may selectively attenuate the expression of specific innate-response genes. The authors did not, however, analyse gene expression during the important early time course of these events (the first hours and days of infection), so determining the exact mechanisms regulating gene expression will take further study. But it is worth mentioning one possible candidate molecule: the nonstructural-1 (NS1) protein of the influenza A virus can suppress innate immunity by disrupting the induction of \u03b1/\u03b2-interferon and/or altering the maturation of host-cell RNA 7 , 8 . Of course, NS1 does not work alone 9 , and virulence attributed to pandemic influenza requires many viral components in a unique assemblage of genes 1 , 2 . The work of Kobasa  et al . substantiates the findings of Kash  et al . 10 , who showed in mice that the 1918 virus triggered a vigorous innate immune response that was linked to fatalities. Although the mechanisms of tissue destruction were not addressed in either study, the work clearly demonstrates the vital function of early innate immune defences in controlling the virus. It seems that the pandemic 1918 virus had a genetic composition and rapid replication kinetics that may have resulted in an excessively vigorous innate immune and inflammatory response that contributed to severe tissue damage, disease and death. These conclusions correspond to the striking epidemiological data showing that, unlike contemporary influenza strains, which typically affect the very young and the elderly most severely, the 1918 influenza pandemic was mostly fatal in young adults, who generally possess more robust immune systems 1 . Unveiling the contribution of an aberrant host response to the pathogenesis of the 1918 virus is just the beginning of efforts to understand the disease mechanisms underlying the 1918 pandemic and new virulent strains of influenza virus. The emergence of the H5N1 avian influenza or 'bird flu' virus, and its transfer to the human population, are real and continuing threats 1  that underscore the importance of the current study and of characterizing highly pathogenic forms of flu virus. A better understanding of the origin, transmission and virulence of pandemic influenza viruses, and their interactions with host immune processes, will assist our preparation against future and possibly deadly influenza pandemics.

Evidence is mounting that these could be the signatures of stars in early 'protogalaxies'. About a year ago, Kashlinsky  et al . found evidence for fluctuations in background infrared light from far-off cosmological sources larger than would be expected from unresolved galaxies in known populations 1 , 2 . In two papers to be published in  The Astrophysical Journal , the same authors now confirm the effect in different and larger sections of the sky 3 , 4 . They argue that the most plausible interpretation is fluctuations in the light emitted by an early generation of stars. If so, this is the oldest starlight yet detected, and dates from long before modern giant galaxies formed. In the conventional model of early cosmic evolution, small primordial concentrations in the density of unseen 'dark matter' had, about 100 million years after the Big Bang, finally grown large enough to cause the gravitational collapse of gas towards them. This process created pockets of gas dense enough to collapse of their own accord and form the first stars. By the time the Universe was about 200 million years old, stellar burning in small, pregalactic systems was widespread. After this time, stars formed in successively larger, hierarchically assembled systems. After a few billion years, this evolution culminated in the formation of the giant galaxies that we see all over the Universe today. Detailed, direct observations of pregalactic starlight from the Universe's first billion years would allow astronomers to probe many aspects of the early evolution of the cosmos that are obscure or untested. These include the formation of the first clumps, or 'minihaloes', of dark matter; the collapse of the first clouds of gas on small scales; the formation and explosion of the first stars, and the end of the cosmic 'dark ages'; the chemical enrichment and ionization of the early cosmos; and the energy feedback that apparently kept most gas from ever forming stars. Kashlinsky and colleagues' latest analysis 3  was performed, as before 1 , on deep-field exposures made by NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope. After identifiable sources are masked out and digitally cleaned from the data, a background of fuzzy blobs remains ( Fig. 1 ) that is not consistent with randomly distributed 'shot' noise from unresolved sources. The images show additional fluctuations on scales of about 1 to 10 arcminutes (1/60th to 1/6th of a degree), this upper limit being set by the size of the surveyed fields. The authors' favoured interpretation 4  of this effect is that the blobs represent a fractional fluctuation of a few to about ten per cent in a rather intense background of starlight originating in the first 1.2 billion years of the Universe's existence. This equates to sources at redshifts ( z ) of between about 5 and 20 (where 1 +  z  is the factor by which the Universe has expanded since the source emitted the light). Individual, collapsed star-forming systems associated with early protogalaxies are small and numerous, so their random shot noise is small, and in the absence of other perturbations their light should be relatively smoothly distributed. But standard cosmology predicts that these systems are clustered non-randomly owing to the larger-scale and smaller-amplitude primordial fluctuations in matter density that eventually become giant galaxies and groups of galaxies. Summed along the line of sight, these fluctuations give rise to the detected blobs. (The brighter, uniform, non-fluctuating component of the background is not directly detectable in these data, because it cannot be distinguished from other sources of noise and emission.) That this starlight should appear as puffy blobs at infrared wavelengths is entirely expected 5 . In everyday life, distant things \u2014 whose light has travelled further to reach us \u2014 look smaller. But looking back to redshifts greater than about 1.6, systems in our expanding Universe start appearing larger, not smaller. This odd effect is caused by the expansion itself, which not only shifts the visible spectrum of starlight to longer, infrared frequencies, but also means that older objects at higher redshift were 'closer' at the time they emitted the light. Thus, an object has about the same angular size at redshift 10 as it does at redshift 0.3. At redshift 10, the angular size of the observed blobs, about 100 arcseconds, corresponds to a size of some 1.3 million light years. This size is typical of the dark-matter haloes that eventually collapse into giant galaxies and groups of galaxies (but, at the time the light was emitted, were yet to collapse). At present, the data are not specific enough to allow us to tell where the light is coming from, but a high-redshift interpretation works if the emitting stars are hot, massive and bright. Alternatively, the light might be coming from lower redshifts, but in this case its smooth distribution, and the fact that more starlight has not been seen at optical wavelengths, are puzzling. Either way, the much more powerful telescopes on the way, especially NASA's James Webb Space Telescope, which is scheduled for launch within the next decade, will have plenty to study. This telescope's much larger primary mirror will allow it to resolve the small regions of protogalactic star formation, perhaps find spectroscopic clues as to the redshift of the light, and maybe even detect supernova explosions as the first stars die in the regions surveyed. The evidence seems to be growing that there is more than just a dark sky between the galaxies: ripples of infrared starlight glow in every direction. Reprints and Permissions"},

This limitation has been overcome to reveal the dynamics of a large protein complex. If biology were a car, structural biologists would be looking under the bonnet to find out how the engine works. Put more prosaically, structural biology aims to understand how biology works at the molecular level. Much information is gleaned by studying at atomic resolution the three-dimensional structures of molecules that make up living organisms, and the interactions of these molecules with one another. But, just as a photograph of a car engine doesn't tell us how that engine actually works, static biological structures alone may not suffice for us to work out the functional mechanisms of biomolecules. Instead, a video of the structural dynamics \u2014 analogous to observations of a running car engine made from inside and out \u2014 would be much more revealing. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy provides just such an observational tool, allowing precise measurement of both the range of molecular motion and the speed at which elements within biological structures move. On  page 618  of this issue, Sprangers and Kay 1  report their use of an original NMR technique to garner details of atomic motions in a molecular 'machine': the 20S proteasome core particle (CP) Footnote  1 . With a molecular mass of 670 kilodaltons (kDa), this protein complex is much larger and more complicated than anything previously studied at this level of detail with NMR. The study provides fresh insight into how the proteasome performs its function of removing damaged and misfolded proteins from cells. So far, the most common use of NMR in structural biology has been the determination of three-dimensional structures in solution. For this purpose, NMR has the advantage over X-ray crystallography in that it can be applied to systems that cannot be crystallized, of which there are many. However, X-ray crystallography is applicable to large molecular assemblies \u2014 such as intact viruses or the ribosome complexes responsible for protein assembly \u2014 that NMR has been unable to tackle. The NMR frequency of any given atomic nucleus depends on the local dipolar magnetic fields from other nearby nuclei, and the orientation of its surrounding electron cloud relative to the magnetic field that is applied during an NMR experiment. To obtain a sharp spectrum, solution NMR spectroscopy relies on the rapid brownian tumbling of molecules to average the orientation-dependent interactions to zero over time. But the larger the molecule, the slower it tumbles, and the poorer the resolution in the NMR spectrum. In practice, this limits detailed structural NMR studies to systems smaller than about 50 kDa. The motion-dependent fluctuations of the local magnetic fields cause nuclear-spin magnetization to return to its natural equilibrium state, in a process known as relaxation. For molecules with internal flexibility, relaxation rates are governed not only by the overall tumbling, but also by the magnitude and rate of motions within the macromolecule. Almost 10 years ago it was demonstrated that, although relaxation-causing magnetic interactions are generally additive, they can also interfere with one another 2 . This interference can lead to greatly enhanced resolution for 'backbone' amide signals \u2014 that is, for the NMR signals from the amide bonds that connect the amino acids in a protein \u2014 using a procedure known as transverse relaxation optimized spectroscopy (TROSY). These amides are not only the cornerstones for determining protein structures by NMR, they also provide information about protein molecular motion. However, it is the side chains of proteins that interact most frequently with other molecules, so how can information be obtained about these peripheral groups? During the past few years, Kay and co-workers have developed an analogous TROSY technology that focuses on methyl (CH 3 ) groups 3 , 4 . This technique is even more powerful than the original amide TROSY method, and results in sharp NMR signals for molecules exceeding 1 MDa in size. Methyl-TROSY also takes advantage of the fact that methyl groups, such as those found in certain amino-acid side chains, spin very rapidly about their axes of three-fold symmetry, so scaling down their effective magnetic interactions before overall tumbling. Sprangers and Kay 1  now use this technique to examine the 20S proteasome CP. The three-dimensional structure of this complex, which had previously been elucidated by X-ray crystallography, is constructed from two types of protein building block, referred to as \u03b1 and \u03b2. Each type of building block forms two heptameric rings (\u03b1 7  and \u03b2 7 ), which stack together in an \u03b1 7 \u2013\u03b2 7 \u2013\u03b2 7 \u2013\u03b1 7  manner to form the barrel-shaped CP (see Fig. 3c of ref.  1 ). The two outer \u03b1 7  rings form the entrance channels for substrates and the binding sites for other multimeric protein complexes, including that of the heptameric 11S activator, which modulates proteasomal activity. The interfaces between the \u03b1 7  and \u03b2 7  rings enclose two antechambers where protein substrates are stored before degradation, and the two inner \u03b2 7  rings enclose the catalytic chamber where the active sites for degradation are sequestered within the lumen of the barrel. The authors use methyl-TROSY to study the motions of almost 100 methyl groups that are found in isoleucine, leucine and valine amino-acid residues in the \u03b1-subunits. They do this for the \u03b1-subunit in isolation, for assembled \u03b1 7  rings and for the full CP, and also examine the effect of binding of the 11S activator to the CP. In this way, they identify rapid, large-amplitude motions for a region of the \u03b1-protein implicated in transport of the proteasome to cell nuclei in mammalian systems. These movements occur on a time scale that is fast, compared with the nearly 200 nanoseconds it takes the CP to change its orientation by one radian as it tumbles. Much slower motions (of the order of a millisecond) are seen for methyl groups lining the inside of the \u03b2-barrel. These all occur at the same rate, which strongly suggests that they are correlated with one another and that they form part of a unique mechanistic process \u2014 presumably the transport of substrate to the catalytic chamber. The remarkable success of Sprangers and Kay in obtaining high-quality NMR data for such a large system derives in part from their careful choice of a highly symmetrical complex, in which all of the subunits of the same type (either \u03b1 or \u03b2) are magnetically equivalent. The CP complex can be dissected into stable components, which can then be studied in isolation and as reassembled particles. This feature was essential to assigning each of the almost 100 simultaneously detected NMR signals to its specific methyl group. However, the need for high symmetry will be reduced by the substantial increase in sensitivity afforded by the next generation of NMR machines. The prospects are therefore excellent that NMR will provide information about the internal dynamics and transient interactions of a wide variety of molecular machines. This information, when combined with structural data from X-ray diffraction and electron microscopy, will guide our understanding of how biomolecules work at a molecular level.

Hsieh-Wilson"}], "parsed_as_year": "2006_or_before", "body": "Peptides and proteins with sugars attached have many desirable biological properties, but their chemical synthesis is a technical challenge. An ingenious take on an old idea might simplify things considerably. Part of what distinguishes us from bacteria is that the proteins in our bodies are decorated with elaborate arrays of sugars. Protein glycosylation \u2014 the attachment of sugars to the amino-acid building-blocks of proteins \u2014 plays a crucial role in such diverse processes as protein folding, cell\u2013cell communication and viral invasion of cells. Yet it is conspicuously absent in many simple, unicellular organisms. Understanding the roles of these sugars and how their complex, disparate structures modulate the activities of proteins has been a long-standing challenge. Reporting in the  Journal of the American Chemical Society 1 , Brik and colleagues bring us a step closer to this goal by devising a clever strategy for generating glycopeptides \u2014 short sequences of amino acids with sugars attached \u2014 that may one day permit the tailored synthesis of glycoproteins. Glycopeptides and glycoproteins are notoriously difficult to obtain as pure compounds, because they are naturally expressed as inseparable mixtures of different structures (glycoforms) that bear various sugars. This complexity makes it difficult to study how any specific glycoform affects a protein's function, which in turn complicates efforts to generate protein-based medicines. Indeed, most therapeutic glycoproteins are sold as mixtures of glycoforms, the active components of which are often unknown. One approach to solving this problem is to use chemical synthesis to create single structures. Brik and colleagues 1  have now developed a strategy for assembling glycopeptides using a process known as peptide ligation. In their method, one peptide is attached to another that incorporates a modified sugar. A unique feature of this approach is that the sugar assists the process by positioning the two peptides in close proximity to each other. Traditional glycopeptide synthesis is cumbersome, requiring excesses of reagents to drive reactions to completion, and often producing low yields of the desired products. Furthermore, strategies involving 'protecting groups' have been necessary to mask reactive chemical groups that do not participate directly in the reaction sequence. These requirements increase the complexity and the cost of glycopeptide synthesis. But by actively engaging a sugar in the ligation process, Brik  et al . demonstrate that a variety of glycopeptides can be made in just a few steps and in high yield, without the need for protecting groups. The authors' strategy is a clever twist on a well-established method for peptide synthesis known as native chemical ligation 2 . In this process, two peptide fragments are joined together to form a larger fragment via a two-step mechanism. The first step involves the transient formation of a thioester bond between the two fragments ( Fig. 1a ), mediated by a reactive sulphur atom on one of the fragments. The resulting intermediate then undergoes a rapid, spontaneous rearrangement to form a peptide bond. The net result is the direct connection of two peptide fragments to form a larger polypeptide. Moderately sized proteins have been produced in this way by sequential ligation of several peptide fragments, or through the coupling of a peptide to a larger protein fragment. Crucially, native chemical ligation provides exquisite control over the protein structure being formed, and allows the incorporation of various useful groups \u2014 such as synthetic amino acids, biophysical probes or stable isotopes of atoms used for structural studies \u2014 into selected sites within proteins 3 , 4 . Building on this approach, Brik and colleagues 1  attached a reactive sulphur group to a sugar within a peptide ( Fig. 1b ). In a process similar to the two-step mechanism for native chemical ligation, the authors reacted this sulphur group with a second peptide to form a thioester intermediate. This intermediate subsequently rearranges to give the desired product, in which the two starting materials are linked by a peptide bond. This strategy 1  has several remarkable features. Native chemical ligation requires cysteine \u2014 a sulphur-containing amino acid \u2014 to be at the reacting end of one of the peptides being joined together. By placing a reactive sulphur group on the sugar of a glycopeptide, rather than in an amino acid, the authors circumvent this requirement, thus allowing bonds to be formed between a broader range of amino acids. Moreover, a surprisingly wide array of amino acids is tolerated at the reaction site, thus permitting access to glycopeptides that are difficult to synthesize using other methods. Amino acids with small side-chains and those (such as histidine or aspartate) with side-chains that can serve as a base in the ligation pathway are favoured substrates in the reaction. Finally, the sulphur atom on the sugar provides a convenient handle for subsequent chemical manipulation \u2014 for example, it can be removed to give a naturally occurring sugar, reacted to append fluorescent dyes or other groups to the glycopeptide, or elaborated to form more complex sugars by using glycosyltransferase enzymes 1 . Further investigations are needed to assess the full scope of Brik and colleagues' reaction 1  and its potential application to glycoprotein synthesis. Nonetheless, the emergence of this and other methods 5 , 6 , 7 , 8  for constructing pure peptides and proteins with sugars installed at preselected sites has many implications. For example, such techniques could transform the way therapeutic glycoproteins are discovered, developed and manufactured. Many of these proteins are obtained only as a mixture of glycoforms, just a fraction of which may be biologically active 9 . But if drug-regulation authorities start to impose stringent regulations on glycoproteins (as they currently do for traditional 'small molecule' drugs, where the purity of the active form is paramount), then single glycoforms will be required. Furthermore, the ability to fine-tune the biological properties of therapeutic proteins by modifying their attached sugars could lead to exciting advances in drug discovery. More fundamentally, having access to pure glycoproteins would help to elucidate the role of specific sugars in regulating protein structure and function. This could help to reveal how bacteria manage without these sweet appendages. Brik and colleagues' method 1  for making pure glycopeptides (and possibly glycoproteins) is truly a milestone achievement in this rapidly developing field. Reprints and Permissions"},

Given that the membrane technology is seemingly so mature, why should we bother searching for new methods and different starting materials? At present, all technologically relevant nanoporous membranes are prepared by initiating the precipitation of a polymer from solution. This is achieved through the addition of a non-solvent (often water), or by rapid cooling. The solution precipitates into micrometre- and nanometre-sized domains rich in polymer that form a filter structure. Between these polymer domains, polymer-free areas form the pore system. A diverse spectrum of morphologies and geometries can thus be produced from a variety of starting materials 2 . These nanoporous membranes have a thin skin, typically less than 500 nanometres thick, made up of small bumps, or nodules, with a radius of a few to 50 nm. The voids between the nodules determine the pore size; the pores are 1\u201350 nm across, and thus the porosity of the membrane as a whole is low. A much thicker layer, with a larger pore size and porosity, provides mechanical support for the nodular skin. Although the pore size of the membrane skin can be adjusted by the choice of starting material and processing route, other morphological parameters, such as its thickness, porosity and pore-size distribution, are surprisingly insensitive to such choices 3 . Nanoporous membranes prepared according to these methods suffer from a typical trade-off: the flux through them can be enhanced by increasing the pore diameter, but at the cost of less effective molecular discrimination. Optimizing flux and selectivity simultaneously requires a fundamentally new approach, which Striemer and colleagues 1  offer. Not only do the authors' porous nanocrystalline silicon (pncSi) membranes combine small membrane thickness and pore sizes ( Fig. 1 ), but they are also robust, their pore size can be controlled, and they are simple to produce. Earlier attempts to make ultrathin nanoporous membranes used either sophisticated nanolithography or were based on colloidal templates 4 , 5 . The first method is expensive; and although the second makes elegant use of self-organization principles, very small, controlled pore sizes are difficult to achieve. Striemer and colleagues' nanopores self-form from a deposited layer of amorphous silicon through rapid thermal annealing 6 . The pore sizes can be controlled between 5 and 25 nm (the range of interest for protein separation) by the choice of annealing temperature. Although the pore-size distribution is not extremely narrow, it has no tail to larger pore sizes. The absence of such a tail is a prerequisite for molecular specificity \u2014 and still a challenge for state-of-the-art polymer-based membranes. The authors find that two important proteins, immunoglobulin-\u03b3 and bovine serum albumin (BSA), with hydrodynamic diameters of 14 and 6.8 nm, and molecular weights that similarly differ by a factor of a little more than two, can be separated using their pncSi membrane. For efficient separation using conventional ultrafiltration membranes, a molecular-weight ratio of more than ten is needed. The flux through the pncSi membranes is more than ten times faster than that through conventional membranes with similar selectivity properties. Moreover, Striemer  et al . 1  find that by changing the surface charge of their membrane through chemical modification, they can separate proteins that are similar in size, but bear a different charge 7 . Perhaps the most promising advantage of the method presented by Striemer  et al . is that it can be easily integrated into 'labs-on-a-chip' \u2014 microfluidics systems that are currently enjoying rapidly growing attention owing to their potential for medical diagnostics, drug discovery and chemical synthesis 8 , 9 , 10 . It is that promise of integration with other nanofluidic separation and analysis techniques for biochemical and biomedical applications that, together with the inherent advantages of the silicon-based system, make this such an important step forward. We look forward to further improvements and proposals for additional uses for the technique. Reprints and Permissions"},

True or not, the tale shows that the best solutions can sometimes be found in mundane objects. And, indeed, that they can be found in pencils. Pencils contain graphite, a form of carbon in which atoms are ordered in thin sheets stacked regularly on top of each other. The interaction between these sheets is small, so layers of graphite rub off easily, for example when a pencil draws a line on paper. Not satisfied with such an obvious, practical use, physicists have long been fascinated by the electronic properties of a single sheet of graphite, called graphene. Graphene is unlike any other material because electrons within it can behave as massless particles, which means they can mimic relativistic physics. Exotic effects that normally require huge particle accelerators might therefore be observed in a simple device \u2014 if only it were possible to rub off one, and only one, sheet of graphene. Despite concerted efforts, this proved problematic. In 2004, researchers at the University of Manchester, UK, finally isolated graphene when they peered through a conventional optical microscope at flakes of graphite that they had simply ripped off from a larger piece with sticky tape ( K. S. Novoselov  et al .  Science   306,  666\u2013669; 2004 ). Graphene, being a layer just one atom thick, is transparent to light. But, as the picture here shows, there is just enough contrast from the thickness variation in a graphite shaving to locate the graphene layer under the microscope (here, the faint, semi-transparent region on the right, indicated by an arrow). The image was obtained by Hubert Heersche and colleagues, who in this week's issue describe an experiment in which they attached a graphene sheet to two superconducting electrodes (H. B. Heersche  et al .  Nature   446 , 56\u201359; 2007). Previous experiments had thrown up the unexpected finding that graphene has a small electrical conductivity even in the absence of mobile charge carriers. Heersche  et al . add to the surprise by showing that the same holds true for a superconducting current. Moreover, it was not at all clear that a supercurrent could flow in graphene. As it turns out, not only does a conventional electron supercurrent flow, but so does one consisting of holes, which carry positive charge. This experiment shows yet again that novel and surprising effects can be observed in simple materials \u2014 good news for those who don't have a million dollars to spend on discovering something new.

Caterina"}], "parsed_as_year": "2006_or_before", "body": "The spiciness of foods such as horseradish is perceived through sensory neurons of the pain pathway. The lingering pungency of some such foods results from chemical modification of the channels that trigger these neurons. Despite their highly dissimilar flavours, garlic, horseradish and cinnamon all share the ability to 'bite back' with a fiery sensation. This pungency is attributable to chemicals that activate a specific ion-channel protein, known as transient receptor potential ankyrin 1 (TRPA1) 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 . Activated TRPA1 mediates the flow of ions into the endings of specialized neurons in the mouth and skin. This excites the neurons, resulting in local inflammation and our perception of burning pain. The activation of many ion channels by chemicals involves a readily reversible binding of the stimulating molecules. But two studies 5 , 6  now provide evidence that the spicy compounds found in the foods listed above activate TRPA1 in a different, and often more sustained, manner \u2014 by covalently attaching themselves to cysteine amino-acid residues on the channel protein  Footnote  1 . The TRPA1 channel can be activated by an array of chemical and physical signals. The food constituents that act on TRPA1, as well as other chemical activators of this channel such as acrolein 7  (an environmental irritant) and icilin 8  (a substance that evokes a cooling sensation), are structurally very diverse ( Fig. 1 ). TRPA1 can also be activated by several other cell-communication pathways, including G-protein-coupled signalling pathways 1 , 3  and membrane depolarization 5 , and might even participate in cold-sensing and mechanosensation 8 , 9 . How can one channel be activated by so many and such varied stimuli? On  page 541  of this issue, Macpherson  et al . 5  note that many TRPA1 stimuli are electrophiles capable of reacting with cysteine residues (albeit by different mechanisms). They reasoned that this property, rather than chemical geometry, might account for their shared activation of TRPA1. To test this hypothesis, they synthesized supercinnamaldehyde, an analogue of cinnamaldehyde (the pungent ingredient in cinnamon oil) predicted to exhibit greater reactivity with cysteine residues. Indeed, supercinnamaldehyde proved to be an even more potent activator of TRPA1 than cinnamaldehyde. Furthermore, the authors showed that iodoacetamide and methanethiosulphonates, two synthetic compounds that modify cysteines by alternative chemical mechanisms, could also activate TRPA1. To address more directly whether TRPA1 is covalently modified by cysteine-reactive stimulants (agonists), Macpherson  et al . exposed cells expressing mouse TRPA1 to agonists that had been adorned with an additional chemical group known as an alkyne. The authors then isolated the TRPA1 protein from the cells, and added a fluorescent molecule that reacts with alkynes. So, in positions where TRPA1 had bound covalently to an agonist, it acquired fluorescence. Using mass spectrometry, the authors then showed more precisely that at least 14 of the 31 cysteine residues of mouse TRPA1 can be bound by iodoacetamide in living cells. Almost all of these residues are located in the amino (N)-terminal domain of the channel, which is situated in the cytoplasm of the cell. Thus, the cysteine-reactive agonists must enter the cell before activating TRPA1. Among the 14 modified cysteines, Macpherson  et al . found three \u2014 two close together, and one 200 amino acids away \u2014 whose substitution with serine reduced the activation of TRPA1 by cysteine-reactive agonists ( Fig. 2 , overleaf). These mutations also partially diminished activation of TRPA1 by stimuli such as membrane depolarization that are unlikely to act as covalent cysteine modifiers. Even with correction for this general effect, however, the ability of cysteine-reactive compounds to activate TRPA1 was disproportionately impaired in the mutants. Although this preferential effect might be coincidental, the most likely explanation is that covalent modification of these cysteines \u2014 individually, together or in combination with others \u2014 accounts for the activation of TRPA1 by electrophiles. As reported in the  Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , Hinman  et al . 6  also used a chemical-biology strategy to arrive at essentially the same conclusions regarding the action of cysteine-modifying agents on TRPA1. Their study identified three neighbouring cysteines on human TRPA1 in which simultaneous mutation negated the channel-activating effects of several cysteine-modifying reagents. The key cysteines identified by the studies are all among residues conserved between mouse and human TRPA1. Nevertheless, only one cysteine residue was identified as crucial in both studies, possibly reflecting subtle differences between species in overall TRPA1 structure. Aside from the newly identified sites of electrophile action, the TRPA1 N-terminal domain contains 18 ankyrin repeat motifs and an EF-hand domain. These two features have been proposed to contribute to the regulation of the channel by mechanical force and calcium ions, respectively. Clearly, the structural consequences of covalent cysteine modification on these domains and the remainder of the channel will be a fascinating topic for future study. Another minor discrepancy between the two studies 5 , 6  involves the duration of covalent TRPA1 activation. Although both groups showed that certain activators achieve essentially permanent TRPA1 modification, the longevity of changes evoked by mustard oil differed between the studies. This discrepancy might relate to the use of mouse versus human TRPA1, or to the different systems in which the authors analysed TRPA1 function. It also highlights the fact that the lifetimes of covalent cysteine modifications can vary, depending on the modifying agent and on environmental factors such as pH or redox state 10 . This variability, which is exaggerated by non-covalent activation of TRPA1, might lead to differences in the duration, magnitude and qualitative features of TRPA1-mediated food pungency, inflammation and pain 7 , 9 . How general is the covalent regulation of ion channels by cysteine modification? In Hinman and colleagues' study 6 , cysteine-reactive compounds failed to activate several related TRP-family channels or to promote calcium influx into sensory neurons devoid of TRPA1. However, a cysteine-reactive TRPA1 activator from garlic, allicin, was reported in another study to activate TRPV1, through an unknown mechanism 4 . Furthermore, nitric oxide can stimulate certain TRP channels by attaching covalently to cysteines in the vicinity of the channel pore 11 . Analogous regulation by such nitrosylation also occurs in several other channel families 12 . In another twist, Hinman  et al . found that, at high concentrations, mustard oil can activate TRPA1 through a cysteine-independent, and probably covalent, mechanism requiring a lysine in the N terminus. These TRPA1 findings 5 , 6  will probably evoke a sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu among investigators in the cancer research field. Electrophilic agents can be damaging to DNA and proteins, one potential step towards cancer. But many of the cysteine-reactive compounds that activate TRPA1 induce the expression of the enzymes that detoxify them \u2014 protecting against such injury. For instance, KEAP1 is a gene-regulatory protein that binds to and inhibits the actions of NRF2, which would otherwise activate the expression of particular detoxifying enzymes. Covalent modification at two cysteine residues causes pairs of KEAP1 molecules to become crosslinked, and disrupts their interaction with NRF2, resulting in expression of the enzymes 13 . It will be interesting to determine whether crosslinking between subunits also occurs during the activation of TRPA1 by cysteine modification. Perhaps more important will be determining whether the KEAP1 and TRPA1 systems, with their respective biochemical and behavioural outputs, cooperate or have coevolved to fight the war against electrophilic attack.
