Karen Fox finds out whether this machine really can breathe fresh life into the ageing Tennessee lab that is its home. Oak Ridge National Laboratory is more than 60 years old and, until recently, it looked that way. Despite its track record in nuclear research, the host of wildlife that wanders on campus, and the pretty sunsets over the rolling hills of eastern Tennessee, it looked unlikely to entice the energetic people who are the lifeblood of any great laboratory. Salvation may be at hand. The Spallation Neutron Source (SNS), the largest scientific facility to be built in the United States for a decade, will become operational at Oak Ridge by next June. The $1.4-billion machine will generate neutron beams by firing high-energy protons at liquid mercury. Hundreds of visiting researchers are expected to descend on the laboratory and use these beams to probe the structures of molecules and crystals. \u201cWhat this brings to the table is the opportunity to do an entirely new class of experiment,\u201d says Jack Rush, who retired earlier this year as director of neutron scattering at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in Gaithersburg, Maryland. Researchers around the world will be keen to assess the popularity and capabilities of the new facility. Once there would have been no question about the usefulness of such a resource. But in the two decades since the US Department of Energy (DOE) first planned a neutron facility at Oak Ridge, the options available for mapping molecular and crystalline structures have widened. Facilities that use X-rays to probe these structures, such as the Advanced Photon Source at Argonne National Laboratory in Illinois, have become vastly more powerful. Meanwhile, the number of researchers who work with neutrons has declined as several ageing neutron-source facilities have closed. Despite this, Japan is building a research facility similar to the SNS at Tokai, which will be ready in 2007. European plans for an even more advanced spallation source hit political setbacks a couple of years ago; their proponents are keen to revive them as a way of preserving the continent's long-standing lead in neutron science. \n               Building excitement \n             At Oak Ridge, the new neutron source is generating a palpable buzz. The facility managers are aware that many potential users of the technique have learned to live without it. So to bring them to a site far from the universities where they work will require exceptional management and technical support. \u201cYou can have a philosophy of \u2018if you build it, they will come\u2019,\u201d says Paul Butler, team leader for NIST's small-angle neutron-scattering instrument. \u201cBut in my experience that doesn't work. You have to do more.\u201d Butler is on the SNS users group committee, formed when construction began in 1999, to make sure the neutron source goes that extra mile to meet scientists' needs. Oak Ridge managers know they face a challenge. They anticipate that just a few hundred researchers will use the facility during its first two years of operation, while its neutron output slowly ramps up to its full potential. But they expect this to build up to 2,000 users a year by 2015, as researchers currently accustomed to using advanced X-ray sources begin to be converted to the subtler and sometimes complementary charms of neutrons. Supporters of the neutron source say that it does things that other mapping tools can't do. X-rays bounce off electrons, and so scatter much more spectacularly from heavier elements that have many electrons than from lighter ones, such as hydrogen, which has only one. It has been estimated that, as a result, the placement of about half of the hydrogen atoms in published protein structures derived from X-ray studies are not known. Neutrons interact directly with nuclei, making lighter atoms easy to identify. \n               Structured approach \n             Dean Myles, head of structural biology at Oak Ridge, points out that another advantage of dealing with nuclei, rather than electrons, is the ability to distinguish between different isotopes of the same element. This means that researchers can, for example, use deuterium \u2014 a heavy isotope of hydrogen \u2014 as a marker for the position of a particular atom in a molecule or structure. \u201cI liken it to a black cat in a snow field,\u201d says Myles. Because neutron sources can map structures over time, a molecule labelled with deuterium could, for instance, be watched as it wanders across the surface of a sample that mimics a cell membrane. Oak Ridge is keen to teach its users the chemical tricks necessary for such work, and the lab is also growing bacteria in deuterium-rich media so that they produce deuterated proteins. Neutrons can also probe magnetic moments in solids and phenomena such as high-temperature superconductivity. Theories explaining superconductivity can be tested by mapping the position and movement of oscillations of the magnetic moment at a range of different atomic energy levels, Rush says. And the SNS should be able to collect these data some ten times more quickly than existing neutron facilities, owing to its high neutron flux. This high flux level \u2014 up to 10 17  neutrons per square centimetre per second \u2014 will also allow users of the facility to extract useful information from smaller samples. This, says Rush, is a valuable capacity for people studying things in short supply, such as proteins or newly developed polymers. The facility also incorporates specialized equipment to cater for different research needs. One instrument will place samples under extremely high pressure, helping planetary scientists who want to model the hydrogen-rich interior of Jupiter. Until now, it has been a struggle to reach pressures above 25 kilobars simply because of a lack of beam intensity at neutron sources, says Richard Nelmes, who specializes in high-pressure neutron science at ISIS, the British neutron facility near Oxford, which is currently the most powerful spallation source in the world. For Oak Ridge \u2014 the largest of the DOE's civilian laboratories \u2014 the new facility provides a badly needed opportunity to regain scientific momentum. \u201cIt's a little bit of an engine you get rolling,\u201d says Jeff Wadsworth, Oak Ridge's director. \u201cIt generates an optimism that feeds on itself.\u201d \n               Face lift \n             Oak Ridge was built in 1943 to produce uranium and plutonium for the Manhattan Project, and a major new facility hasn't been added since the high-flux isotope reactor was built in 1966. \u201cThere was first-class research and great people, but it looked like a decrepit 1950s lab,\u201d says Thomas Mason, who joined the SNS project at Oak Ridge in 1998, becoming the lab's associate director three years later. \u201cPeople weren't working with state-of-the-art facilities.\u201d Next year's opening is the culmination of a prolonged struggle to rectify that. Back in 1984, a National Academy of Sciences panel recommended the distribution of various scientific facilities to different DOE labs, with the largest one \u2014 a proposed advanced neutron-source reactor \u2014 allocated to Oak Ridge. But in 1995 Congress halted the $2.9-billion project just before construction began. The DOE decided to build a less expensive, accelerator-based neutron source instead: the SNS. Developed as a joint project between a number of the department's laboratories, including Los Alamos in New Mexico and Brookhaven in New York state, it was decided to locate the facility at Oak Ridge, in the home state of then-vice-president Al Gore. After construction began, Oak Ridge's management contract was taken over by the University of Tennessee and Battelle, a contract research organization based in Ohio. The new management team has been working hard to secure extra investment for the lab: for instance, it has borrowed $115 million from private banks to build associated infrastructure, including a new centre for computational sciences. On the back of that, Oak Ridge has won leadership of a large DOE supercomputing initiative. \u201cThere is a substantial amount of risk that goes along with the debt,\u201d says Wadsworth. \u201cBut we believed it would help to attract more contracts and to grow our business, and so far we've been successful.\u201d Ultimately, Oak Ridge will measure its success by its ability to attract world-quality researchers \u2014 both as visitors and as staff. \u201cYou put enough bright people together and interesting things happen,\u201d says Butler. \u201cThere are all these buildings going up on the hill, and then you put in these people and resources, and add 1,500 users with all their new ideas.\u201d In these gentle southern hills, he predicts, \u201cit's going to be a melting pot of ideas, bubbling away\u201d. \n                     In defence of the Department of Energy \n                   \n                     Green light for US spallation source \n                   \n                     Spallation Neutron Source \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Rex Dalton meets the scientists working to keep the blue agave diverse enough to survive. For centuries, artisans working in the adobe haciendas of Mexico's rural valleys have followed tradition to make the powerful spirit tequila. Copying age-old indigenous techniques, they distilled the liquor from sweet juice cooked out of the fat stems of a local succulent, the blue agave ( Agave tequilana  Weber, var.  azul ). But in recent years, tequila makers have had to bring the latest science to the agricultural process to save both the industry and the culture it supports. Some of the oldest and biggest producers are employing scientists, building high-tech laboratories and funding academic research on the blue agave so that researchers from biochemists to geneticists can scrutinize this little-understood plant. The shift began nearly a decade ago, when disease and pests wiped out much of Mexico's crop of blue agave. The plants are grown in expansive ranches, as a single agave takes years to reach maturity for harvest. But those huge monocultural crops, planted to slake the worldwide thirst for tequila, are also an ideal place for disease to spread. Tequila was nearly destroyed by its own popularity. The agave plant grows a rounded stem covered with thick, spiked leaves. The plants are harvested at the age of seven years, when sugar content is at its peak. The leaves are cut off, leaving a \u2018head\u2019 that looks like a huge pineapple. Heads are then cooked for the sweet juice, which is fermented and distilled into liquor. Until about 25 years ago, tequila was known mostly as a traditional drink in Mexico, rarely savoured outside the country save by college students and the adventurous. But in the early 1980s, enthusiasm for the beverage blossomed as its better-quality varieties became more widely known \u2014 with help from songs such as Jimmy Buffett's classic  Margaritaville . \n               Boom time \n             To meet demand, ranchers industrialized the planting process to produce millions of genetically similar blue agave plants for maximum yields. Plantings of blue agave leapt from 16,000 hectares to nearly 50,000 in less than a decade. But by following this route, plant scientists say, the ranchers sowed thousands of hectares with plants whose lack of diversity left the crop susceptible to devastation when disease struck. Agave plantations are generally all of the same variety. Farmers usually cut off the flowering stalk to increase the plant's sugar load, which means that the plants aren't cross-pollinated by bats or other animals as they would be normally. Without that mixing, the blue agave crop is nearly genetically uniform, a situation that renders it particularly prone to disease. A single pathogen can rapidly destroy most of an entire crop. \u201cWe told them this was going to happen,\u201d says Gary Paul Nabhan, an ethnobotanist at Northern Arizona University, Flagstaff, who with Mexican ethnobotanist Ana Valenzuela Zapata wrote a seminal book on the problem 1 . \u201cBut they wouldn't listen to us.\u201d Beginning in the late 1980s, disease began to rot agaves in the fields. And then, in 1996 and 1997, a climate shift enveloped the prime agave-growing states near Mexico's southwestern Pacific coast. The warmer temperatures and increased rainfall proved devastating for the plants 2 . Diseases and weevils attacked: a bacterium ( Erwinia carotovora ) and a fungus ( Fusarium oxysporum ) were particularly malign, ruining the valuable heads. Ranchers, who must tend fields for years before getting the money from a harvest, were left with unusable agaves. Many decided to cut their losses and abandon agave harvest: by some estimates, the area of planted fields plunged more than 25%. Producers began to scramble for agaves, and tequila prices skyrocketed. For the first time, tequila makers began tapping other plants for the sugar juices needed for fermentation. Tequila was no longer necessarily made from 100% blue agave \u2014 a sacrilege for traditional ranchers and tequila artisans. At least one vocal producer, who spoke out against reducing the tequila standards, was assassinated during public demonstrations. \n               Traditional tipple \n             By law, tequila production is limited to five states, with most activity in the state of Jalisco. The Mexican Tequila Regulatory Council certifies two types of tequila: the traditional, which is labelled \u201c100% de agave\u201d, and a lesser variety, which can be described as \u2018tequila\u2019 only but must still be made with at least 51% blue agave. In the aftermath of the crop plagues, tequila producers have turned to scientists to revive their crops. But there are only a few specialists, and a very limited literature in agave science. \u201cYou don't find many agave publications in journals,\u201d says Eulogio Pimienta Barrios, an ecological physiologist at the University of Guadalajara. Historically, producers held any specialized agave knowledge close for competitive purposes. But that situation is changing, as producers bring in academic researchers for studies. Just two years ago, the chemical structure of the sugar of the blue agave, a fructan, was described for the first time \u2014 showing that it holds promise for food products for diabetics 3 . And last summer, two of the biggest tequila distillers, Herradura and Sauza, signed a cooperative research agreement to share information about agave science. Villages such as Amatit\u00e1n, 40 kilometres west of Guadalajara, are the nexus of agave culture, where friends sing songs about tequila at informal gatherings. Here, the family-owned Herradura distillery still produces tequila on its 135-year-old hacienda. The agave heads are cooked in old-style ovens and juices fermented in open-top vats: not very different from the way tequila was made in the nineteenth century. But now providing scientific insight is Aide\u00e9 Orozco Hern\u00e1ndez, a biochemist who has worked for the company for about four years. Orozco has installed a laboratory with sophisticated equipment for research into plant breeding and production techniques. Another 15 kilometres west, in the town of Tequila itself, sits the distillery of Sauza, owned by a multinational liquor giant. In 1999, the firm hired plant physiologist Ignacio del Real Laborde. The new cooperative scientific approach, says del Real, is a symbol of the need to see beyond local rivalries and think in terms of a global market. \u201cIt doesn't help to have your neighbour doing bad things,\u201d he says. \u201cSome people weren't doing proper agriculture before, but we are now.\u201d More still needs to be done to adopt sustainable practices, says Valenzuela, who is based at the University of Guadalajara. Ranchers, she says, are reluctant to try new approaches because they fear economic losses. One such issue is whether to allow some plants to flower and so allow cross-pollination. Farmers say they can't afford to lose agaves to pollination and want to maintain their plants' valuable characteristics. \u201cSome are changing,\u201d says Valenzuela. \u201cBut industry people are not paying enough attention to the erosion of biodiversity.\u201d Orozco and other tequila scientists are trying to address this by creating more diverse agave lines for large-scale planting. Last year, Herradura harvested seeds from experimental fields where the agaves were allowed to pollinate naturally. Some 400 agave lines were selected from this experiment for further study, says Orozco, and the best lines will be chosen for breeding and planting. \u201cWe are very confident that new knowledge about the plant will give us more efficiency and quality,\u201d she says. But for del Real, there are limits to applying sustainable agricultural techniques. He doubts whether natural pollination will ever be widespread in agave cultivation, because he fears that the plants could hybridize, creating a version that wouldn't be considered true agave by the tequila regulators. \u201cValenzuela's view is very respected,\u201d he says, \u201cbut we need more basic academic research to understand this plant.\u201d To that end, Sauza is funding projects at half a dozen Mexican universities. At the Center for Research and Advanced Studies in Irapuato, Guanajuato, molecular biologist June Simpson is probing plant genetics. About ten varieties of  A. tequilana  have been identified; her institute's research has shown that all are basically genetically identical, although their colours and shapes can vary slightly 4 . \u201cWhen I present these data to agronomists or farmers, they say they can't be true,\u201d Simpson says, \u201cbecause they see differences in the plants.\u201d In an added twist, she says, a study now in press has found some diversity among these varieties when sampled from a broader area. She is working to develop a test to identify blue agave through genetic fingerprinting, and her institute is using genetic markers to explore for certain key genes associated with plant sugar production. \u201cAll of this is aimed at understanding real genetic improvement,\u201d she says. \u201cThen people can do plant breeding.\u201d \n               Glut and disease \n             But all these new studies cannot staunch the rising fear that another agave crisis could occur. Mexican officials now are predicting a glut of agaves for at least the next three years, with production peaking at nearly 1.8 million tonnes in 2008. Production facilities can accommodate only about half of those, says Alvaro Garc\u00eda Ch\u00e1vez, a rural development official in Jalisco. With agave prices plunging as a result, many ranchers have cut back on caring for their plants \u2014 which, in turn, creates bastions for disease and pests. Already, some estimate that 10% of the agave fields are afflicted with disease. \u201cI hope for the best,\u201d says del Real. \u201cBut yes, I am concerned.\u201d To create new markets for agaves, government officials have encouraged the development of a diabetic-friendly food syrup based on the agave's fructan. But the project uses only a small fraction of excess agaves, leaving scientists and authorities looking for answers to the plant's boom-and-bust cycles. In the end, they may have to hope for a renewed thirst for their drink. Perhaps the new US hit country song, Joe Nichols's  Tequila Makes Her Clothes Fall Off , will again pump up demand. \n                     The past, present, and future of biotechnology in Mexico \n                   \n                     Tequila Regulatory Council \n                   \n                     Paper on Quality Control of Tequila \n                   \n                     Profile of Park Nobel \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Alexandra Witze meets the scientists who are treading a path to the past. There's more to it than just the taste of tannins, the hint of blackberry, the overlay of toasted oak \u2014 and the gentle enticement to intoxication. \u201cEvery time you have a glass of wine you're drinking 100 million years of Earth history,\u201d says David Howell, a geologist at Stanford University in California. Consider, for instance, a glass of fine wine from California's Napa Valley. Its taste depends on the grapes from which it is made, the water and climate encountered by the vines that bore those grapes, their pruning and harvesting by the field workers and the craft of the vintner. But it also draws on the fertile alluvial soil that spreads in fans down from the hills \u2014 hills that are themselves made of ancient oceanic crust, the remains of a collision between tectonic plates. Of the many views one can take of a glass of wine, geology looks furthest back in time. And in recent years a number of geologists have turned this view into a way of offering professional services to the wine business, from helping select the best sites for planting to providing remote-sensing imagery of growing grapes. Next March, many of this new breed will gather at the University of California, Davis, for a leisurely three-day conference on the science of wine \u2014 followed, naturally, by two days of field trips through Napa and Sonoma county vineyards. Tastings are practically mandatory. The focus of these geological considerations,  terroir , is somewhat fuzzy. At its simplest, it is the combination of physical factors \u2014 soil, climate, environment \u2014 that help shape a wine's taste. At its most complex,  terroir  is an interplay involving cultural preferences and a long history of working the land. It can be applied to other products, such as cheeses, that come from a particular and distinctive landscape. It is a concept that can shade into mysticism, or cynicism. Emphasizing the characteristics of a wine's place of origin rather than the grape variety, as the French do, can hint at a unique geological attribute that might be seen as justifying a premium price. \n               Going deep \n             \u201cThere's a fair amount of black magic involved,\u201d says Kenneth Verosub, a palaeomagnetism expert at the University of California, Davis, and organizer of the March conference. And that is where he thinks geology can help. Howell likes to see the concept of  terroir  as a means to an end. \u201cIt's a way of letting people know that there's more to wine than just the grapes and the roots and the soil,\u201d he says. Soil has always been a major part of wineries' worries. Soil scientists advise on the best places to plant vines, and hydrologists suggest how best to water and nurture them. But introducing pure geology \u2014 reaching down to the bedrock itself \u2014 is a relatively new phenomenon for US wineries. Often the geologists help by mapping contacts between different geological units, each of which has its own characteristics for growing grapes. Or they might help winegrowers to understand the three-dimensional picture of a vineyard: vine roots can penetrate many metres down, potentially tapping a deeply buried soil type that differs from that at the surface. That is especially important in the United States, where many wineries are set atop thick alluvial deposits on valley floors, unlike the traditional hillside plantings of European vineyards. And in general, the winemakers seem happy to get scientific advice. \u201cThey are extraordinarily interested in learning as much as they can about the land in which they grow,\u201d says Jonathan Swinchatt, a Connecticut geologist who has collaborated with Howell. One example is Warren Winiarski, owner of Stag's Leap Wine Cellars in Napa Valley. Winiarski says that he appreciates the insights of science without feeling that he needs to understand every last equation. \u201cAn athlete doesn't have to know physiology in order to run the race,\u201d he notes. Winiarski called in geologists because he wanted to understand why wine made with grapes grown in neighbouring vineyards tasted so dramatically different. Two of his vineyards, Fay and Stag's Leap itself, sit side by side and yet identical vines planted in each yielded very different wines. Investigating, Swinchatt and Howell traced the difference back to geology: Fay and Stag's Leap rested on separate alluvial fans spilling down from the mountains. With that information, Winiarski has modified his vine selection and growing practices for each plot of land. Geological studies such as this first became well-known in Napa after the aphid-like insect phylloxera, scourge of vineyards worldwide, began to devastate California grapes in the mid-1980s. The massive die-off caused many winemakers to re-evaluate their land and what should be planted on it. Before that, says Swinchatt, \u201cnobody in Napa would talk about  terroir . If you talked about  terroir  it would be like giving the French some recognition.\u201d But now  terroir  is becoming a West Coast buzzword. Wine marketers see it as a way to individualize each product and stamp it with regional distinction. \u201cThey really appreciate that their geological history makes their vineyards different from vineyards in Kansas or in Italy,\u201d says Larry Meinert, a geologist and wine consultant at Smith College in Northampton, Massachusetts. \n               Ground control \n             Geology is even making it on to labels and into the names of the wines themselves. Columbia Crest, the largest winery in the state of Washington, has introduced a new brand called Torrent: its back label describes the ice-age floods that poured through the scablands of western Washington, scouring the landscape and fashioning the gravels in which the grapes are now grown. Another Washington winemaker has dubbed his land Loess Vineyard, after the air-deposited soils of the region. For Alan Busacca of Washington State University in Pullman, this marks a welcome new accuracy in such matters: he is tired of seeing wine labels that tout the \u2018rich volcanic soils\u2019 of the Pacific Northwest. \u201cThe volcanic stuff is actually a trivial fraction,\u201d he grumbles. \u201cMost of the soils in the northwest are formed from outburst flood deposits, with a mantle of reworked glacial material.\u201d Terroir  as a marketing tool is also catching on outside the United States. Five large new wineries in Patagonia that sit on gravels washed down from the Andes plan to market their geological and geographical characteristics aggressively, says Meinert. In New Zealand, the Gimblett Gravels appellation is defined by a single stratigraphic unit: to bear the Gimblett label, at least 95% of the grapes must be grown on that particular kind of gravel. \u201cThat's a very satisfying thing,\u201d says Meinert. But sometimes, the geology references can degenerate into a deluge of transferred epithets. \u201cI've heard a winemaker correlating the explosive taste of his wine with the explosive nature of the rocks in which it was grown,\u201d says Swinchatt, \u201cor talk about red spicy flavours reflecting the red soil.\u201d A different form of literalism has inspired Randall Grahm, winemaker at California's renowned and eccentric Bonny Doon winery, to experiment with putting smashed-up rocks into wine as it ages. To some, such attempts are an unwelcome geological reductionism. \u201cThe most important thing about this idea of  terroir  comes from learning how to grow grapes and make wines in particular environments,\u201d says Warren Moran, a geographer at the University of Auckland in New Zealand. \u201cEvery region where wine is grown has interesting stories about the way the region developed. That's much more interesting and powerful than any simple environmental determinism.\u201d In some locations, traditional viticultural appellations \u2014 the formalized descriptions of particular grape-growing regions \u2014 happily ignore local stratigraphy. To Moran and other geographers,  terroir  encapsulates far more of the notion of territory than it does of geology. But the geologists are sure they have something to offer \u2014 and, they are happy to admit, something to gain. \u201cI work for wine,\u201d says Terry Wright, a retired field geologist and vineyard consultant in Sonoma county. Consulting fees regularly include a bottle of wine or cases at employee discounts. A few scientists have got so deeply into wine that they have made a second career of it: Busacca, for instance, will leave his university in a few months to start a vineyard consulting business. For geologists, soil scientists and hydrologists looking to get into the field, Meinert advises that they start by learning how sites are chosen for various grapes. \u201cDrink lots of wine and pay attention to what's going on physically,\u201d he says. And for those who do not want to work in wine, but just enjoy it, geology can also help, says Swinchatt. \u201cIf you know the provenance of a painting, it can mean a lot more than if you didn't know anything about its history,\u201d he says. \u201cI think the same is true of wine. If you know where it came from, how it was produced, what kind of care went into making it, it makes a huge difference to how you appreciate it.\u201d \n                     The present and future of the international wine industry \n                   \n                     Wine buffs tongue-tied \n                   \n                     Wine not? \n                   \n                     Gimblett Gravels \n                   \n                     Mechanisms of terroir \n                   \n                     Geotimes article by Larry Meinert \n                   \n                     UC Davis conference: \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Alcohol dehydrogenase is best known as the enzyme that breaks down alcohol in the body, and as such it has been studied exhaustively. But Benner and other researchers in the field have now turned to its evolution, and their work is providing fresh insight into the puzzle of why some creatures, such as yeast, came to make alcohol and why so many others, including ourselves, can tolerate it.

In many creatures, including ourselves, they help to convert alcohols, such as ethanol, into compounds that other enzymes can break down and extract energy from. But in a number of microorganisms, they can help the reverse reaction, making alcohols as part of the process of extracting energy from sugars. The stars of these alcohol-producers are the yeasts. Not only do  Saccharomyces  species of yeast churn out oodles of ethanol, they can also tolerate far higher concentrations of it than other microorganisms. Brewer's yeast ( S. cerevisiae ) owes this ability to two alcohol dehydrogenases: ADH1, which makes ethanol, and ADH2, which breaks it down for use as an energy source. Yeast not only brews its own moonshine, it consumes it too \u2014 \u201cto the last drop\u201d, as Benner says. At first sight, this makes no sense. Making ethanol from sugar and then consuming it is energetically far more wasteful than simply consuming the sugar. Researchers have long pondered why yeast goes to all that trouble. Although it might be nice to think that there is a creature out there whose  raison d'\u00eatre  is to party, evolution doesn't work that way. \n               Make or break \n             Benner and his team came across the explanation when hunting for the origins of ADH in yeast. Benner is interested in combining the study of genes and proteins with geology and palaeontology to gain insight into the history of life on Earth and present-day protein function. \u201cEvery biomolecule is better understood if we know its history as well as its structure,\u201d he says. The  ADH  genes in yeast make an intriguing subject for this approach. When yeast gained its ability to make alcohol, it must have done so as a result of a selection pressure in its environment and, what is more, this would have had a knock-on effect on other creatures. So working out when and how the ADH enzymes came to be could open a small window onto what ecosystems were like back then. ADH  genes and the proteins they make are well studied and have been isolated from many different species of yeast, so Benner's team had plenty of useful material to work with. The goal was to reconstruct the original gene that was duplicated to give rise to  ADH1  and  ADH2 , and to ask what its function was \u2014 did it make alcohol, or did it break it down? From a database of the sequences of related  ADH  genes in various yeasts \u2014 combined with additional  ADH  genes specially sequenced for this study \u2014 Benner and his colleagues assembled an evolutionary tree of yeast  ADH . This showed where the ancestral gene would have fitted in and helped the researchers work out its most likely amino-acid sequence. Inferring the past from the present isn't perfect, so they ended up with 12 slightly different candidate genes 1 . \n               Fruitful collaboration \n             The group then reconstructed all 12 genes and tested them in yeast to see how the enzymes they produced compared with today's ADH enzymes. The supposed ancestor turned out to be most similar to modern-day  ADH1 , the one that helps yeast make alcohol. The same evolutionary tree helped the team to estimate when the ancestor gave rise to the two present  ADH  genes. This information offers some insight into what drove the strategy. Was it humans breeding yeasts and selecting them to accumulate alcohol? Or did the event take place long before that? The group found that duplication of the ancestral gene took place between 80 million and 60 million years ago, which means that humans could not have had anything to do with it. Rather, Benner thinks it was down to flowering plants. \u201cThe hypothesis is that it occurred near the time Earth first provided yeast with fleshy fruits,\u201d he says. With their temptingly large amounts of sugar, the fruit called for a clever strategy. \u201cYeast \u2018realized\u2019 there was a lifestyle opportunity, which involved making large amounts of alcohol as a way of defending the resources against competing organisms,\u201d Benner explains. In other words, yeast came up with a way of \u2018pickling\u2019 the fruit by producing alcohol, which would have made the fruit toxic to its competitors. This had a knock-on effect on its wider ecosystem: as well as killing off its competitors, yeast had created a niche in fermenting fruit for any organism that could devise a way to cope with the alcohol. It was around this time that the fruitflies emerged. Feeding on yeast and fruit juices in rotting fruit that can easily contain alcohol concentrations of 4% or more (about the same as beer), the fruitfly ( Drosophila ) and its larvae found themselves in need of a mechanism for breaking down alcohol.  Drosophila  came up with its own form of ADH, structurally unrelated to that of mammals and yeast. In fruitflies, ADH plays a role in alcohol tolerance but also in energy metabolism, allowing the fly to use alcohol \u2014 indeed many different alcohols \u2014 as energy sources. Different species of  Drosophila  live on different fruits, which in turn produce different combinations of alcohols when they ferment. Given that the biology of ADH is well understood, and that fruitflies are ideal for doing genetics studies, scientists have turned to studying the enzyme to understand how natural selection shapes it to prefer different alcohols in different species. Such studies provide an elegant link between a creature's ecology and the molecular changes that allowed it to exploit its niche. Luciano Matzkin, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Arizona in Tucson, recently looked at ADH in two species of  Drosophila  that feed on different plants. He compared the different versions of the  Adh  gene in each fly, and identified key changes to the enzymes' structures that could have helped the flies adapt to different alcohols 2 . Although alcohol tolerance is clearly an important trait for fruitflies, it is not the only function ADH seems to have in  Drosophila . \u201cIt has played various roles during the evolution of the fruitfly,\u201d Matzkin points out. \u201cIt pops up in many different places.\u201d One of these is related to how well flies can resist a hot environment. Different populations of flies living at different latitudes have different versions of the  Adh  gene. And these patterns can shift rapidly in response to climate change, giving scientists a ringside seat for watching evolution at work, as well as a way of seeing the effects of global warming on ecosystems. \n               Rapid response \n             Together with others, Ary Hoffmann, evolutionary geneticist at La Trobe University near Melbourne, Australia, found that a particular version of the  Adh  gene, called  Adh S , in Australia has spread south by some 400 kilometres in only 20 years 3 . This version of the gene is associated with heat resistance. \u201cTwenty years is rapid in evolutionary terms,\u201d Hoffmann points out. The speed of change suggests that different versions of  Adh  can make a big difference to a fruitfly's survival. ADH, it seems, is a versatile enzyme that has evolved in different times and settings. In fact, ADH activity is carried out by three families of enzymes that seem to have arisen independently. The families are spread among most major life forms \u2014 from bacteria to plants, yeast and animals. It seems as though the structure of ADH, which allows it to bind to alcohol as well as to several other chemicals, made it a useful enzyme under different circumstances. The original purpose of the ADH now found in humans probably wasn't breaking down alcohol: the fact that the enzyme can do this simply came in handy later on. So, what was its original function? At the moment, nobody knows. But some are hazarding a guess. Ricard Albalat, an evolutionary geneticist at the University of Barcelona in Spain, believes it was used to break down other potentially harmful chemicals, such as formaldehyde 4 . \u201cFormaldehyde can react with DNA and cause mutations,\u201d notes Jan-Olov H\u00f6\u00f6g, a medical biochemist at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, Sweden. \u201cThe ability to break it down is a crucial function of ADH.\u201d But whatever their true origins, there is clearly a lot more to these multitalented enzymes than just allowing us to get drunk. As researchers delve further into their history, these molecules are shedding light on the big questions of evolutionary biology. A surefire cause for celebration. \n                     Climate change alters genes on the fly \n                   \n                     Mutant worms withstand boozy bender \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

But such plans need nurturing if they are to succeed, Erika Check discovers. On a cloudy, humid day last month, 250 people gathered near the beach in the small Indonesian village of Kajhu. Local and international officials gave speeches, and some of the villagers performed a traditional dance ceremony. Then, everyone carried shovels and buckets along a gravel road past a flattened area of the beach littered with broken tree stumps. The buckets held tiny mangrove and  Casuarina  pine seedlings, which the villagers tucked into shallow trenches they dug at the water's edge. Kajhu village is in the province of Aceh on Sumatra \u2014 the area most brutally devastated by last year's tsunami. Of the approximately 300,000 killed on 26 December 2004, more than 130,000 were from Aceh. The Kajhu ceremony was a small act of hope in the wake of tragedy. The replanting marked the launch of the Green Coast Programme, a plan drawn up by non-profit groups, international donors and the Indonesian government. The project is one of many across southeast Asia that aims to replace mangrove forests destroyed by the tsunami and by human industry. Mangroves have been disappearing from southeast Asian coastlines for decades, replaced by vast shrimp farms and tourist resorts. In the five countries hit hardest by the tsunami, development eliminated 1.5 million hectares of mangroves between 1980 and 2000 \u2014 26% of the region's mangrove cover 1 . But the devastation wrought by the tsunami has inspired governments to try to restore these ecosystems, which environmental scientists and economists have long said are natural defences against storm damage. Mangrove restoration is notoriously difficult, however, and these replanting projects face huge challenges. Past restoration projects have planted the wrong species in the wrong places, scientists say. And the projects have tended to ignore, alienate or exploit the people living closest to the mangrove forests. \u201cLocal communities must have more of a say in the control, use and protection of mangroves,\u201d says Ed Barbier, an environmental economist at the University of Wyoming in Laramie. Otherwise, future restoration projects will suffer the same fate as past ones \u2014 and fail to have any lasting results. \n               Boom and bust \n             The problem, says Alfredo Quarto, director of the Mangrove Action Project, Port Angeles, Washington, is that \u201cmangrove areas are remote, usually public lands, available to lease by corrupt officials\u201d. Poor fishers and farmers rarely have any land rights and cannot prevent mangroves being cleared for shrimp ponds. \u201cThe people who enforce the laws don't live in these areas and can be convinced by someone with money to turn their backs on the destruction,\u201d Quarto says. When the farms collapse, due to disease or contamination, a wealthy owner can move on to another stretch of virgin coast, leaving a useless waste site behind 2 . Shrimp farms create temporary jobs, but the boom-and-bust cycle hurts villages more than it helps. Healthy mangroves are nurseries for fish, crabs and other creatures that mature in the ocean. So eliminating the mangroves cuts off a source of food and income. Mangrove deforestation compounded the effects of the tsunami. After the wave passed, villagers reported that areas with more mangrove cover suffered less damage. These anecdotal reports have been bolstered by analysis of satellite images taken before and after the tsunami. This October, international researchers coordinated by the Nordic Agency for Development and Ecology in Copenhagen, Denmark, reported that areas with mangrove or tree cover were significantly less likely to have experienced major tsunami damage 3 . The authors caution that vegetation does not prevent the worst devastation, but they see a protective role for plants in reducing damage from regular storms, such as the typhoons that batter the Philippines every year. These findings supported the locals' perceptions that mangroves are natural barriers, says Vaithilingam Selvam of the M. S. Swaminathan Research Foundation in Chennai, India. \u201cIt used to take us years to convince people that mangroves are worth saving,\u201d Selvam says. \u201cNow it is much easier, because people see them as a bioshield.\u201d Many southeast Asian governments have now pledged their support for mangrove restoration. Malaysia has promised $25 million to replace 4,000 hectares of mangroves lost to the storm and to development. Indonesia has pledged $22 million for mangroves, and has already planted 300,000 seedlings near the city of Banda Aceh. The Thai government has expressed its support for mangrove restoration and coastal rebuilding. In India, the government of the southern state of Kerala has pledged $8 million to supplement an existing programme to restore mangroves destroyed by cyclones. International donor groups also offered money and seedlings, and several meetings were set up to coordinate the restoration projects. \n               Shifting ground \n             How likely are these projects to succeed? Many of the seedlings planted on the Aceh coast earlier this year have already died, because they were planted too soon and in the wrong places, say scientists working in the region. \u201cSometimes the site selection was not so good, and there was still debris from the tsunami washing up that destroyed the seedlings,\u201d says Faizal Parish, an ecologist and director of the Global Environment Centre in Selangor, Malaysia. And the paid contractors had no reason to continue caring for the young, fragile shoots. Getting it right is slower and more difficult, say the groups with long-term experience of mangrove restoration in Asia. The Wetlands International Indonesia Programme (WIIP), based in Bogor, Java, has been running projects since 1998. The group coordinates replanting projects by negotiating agreements with villages. The villagers commit to plant a certain number of seedlings they collect from the wild. In return, the programme provides support staff and a loan that the villagers can use to start businesses, such as chicken and goat farms. If 70% of the seedlings are still alive after five years, the village keeps the money; otherwise it must repay part of the loan. Nyoman Suryadiputra, a wetlands ecologist and technical director of WIIP, says this encourages villagers both to plant and care for the forests, making them more likely to survive. So far, villagers have replanted 350 hectares of land along 3.5 kilometres of Indonesian coast through these arrangements. But rebuilding after the tsunami has been more challenging, Suryadiputra says, and covers a wider area. Some of the group's current activities focus on the Aceh coast, including the project in Kajhu. But the group has also begun work on Simeulue Island, 300 km southwest of Banda Aceh, which was hammered by the tsunami and its aftershocks. Before the disaster, Wetlands International estimated that Simeulue Island had at least 1,000 hectares of mangrove swamps. But the tsunami \u2014 plus another earthquake that followed this March \u2014 lifted parts of the island by 1\u20132 metres, cutting off mangroves and coral reefs from the tidal waters that sustain them. And the islanders have been so devastated by these disasters that \u2014 understandably \u2014 planting trees is not their first priority. \u201cMany of the people are still traumatized,\u201d Suryadiputra says. So the group first had to convince Simeulue residents that planting trees would restore some of their lost livelihoods. This summer, staff member Eko Budi Priyanto persuaded villagers in Langi, on Simeulue Island, to plant a nursery of 5,000  Calophyllum  tree seedlings grown from seeds they collected on the beach. Building the nursery brought the village together, as entire families pitched in to help. The seedlings are now about a metre tall and have just been planted, Suryadiputra says. \u201cIt's been a really big challenge, and I don't want to say our approach will be successful,\u201d he says. \u201cWe want to do this properly from the beginning, and that's not easy.\u201d \n               Gathering storm \n             The time and effort involved in community-based programmes makes them harder to execute, but those with experience say approaches that involve local people are the only ones that make sense. In three states in India, where Selvam works, 33 villages have worked with forestry officials to restore 1,500 hectares of mangroves since 1993. So far, three-quarters of the seedlings have survived, Selvam says, double that of other techniques. The communities saw the benefits of their work when the trees buffered the impact of the tsunami, says Selvam, who is trying to enlist new villages in restoration projects. The question is whether commitments to restoration will last longer than one year after the tsunami. Already, there are signs that governments and developers are returning to their old ways. In Indonesia, despite official support for buffer zones, shrimp farms destroyed in the tsunami are being rebuilt without setting aside space for trees. In some cases, says Parish, the Indonesian government has given newly damaged coastal land to developers, to create new shrimp farms. \u201cThese are strong pressures, as they were before,\u201d says Parish. In many cases, local people are unhappy about these new developments, but they lack influence with government officials. This is the situation facing poor communities everywhere, not just in areas hit by the tsunami, says Jurgenne Primavera, a marine biologist at the Southeast Asian Fisheries Development Center in Iloilo, the Philippines. \u201cThe people who are at risk are poor, so they can't lobby the government to put protective greenbelts in the places where they live,\u201d says Primavera. The result in Indonesia, notes Parish, is that \u201cthe initial sensible plan to have some sort of greenbelt along the coast has not advanced as much as it could have.\u201d The next storm in Kajhu is unlikely to be a tsunami, but without healthy mangroves it could still be devastating. \n                     Scientists seek action to fix Asia's ravaged ecosystems \n                   \n                     UN surveys ecological ravages of tsunami \n                   \n                     Asian Tsunami in focus \n                   \n                     Wetlands International \n                   \n                     Mangrove Action Project \n                   \n                     MSSRF, India \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},
{"file_id": "438903a", "url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/438903a", "year": 2005, "authors": [{"name": "Quirin Schiermeier"}], "parsed_as_year": "2006_or_before", "body": "Natural disasters have wreaked havoc on the planet in the past twelve months, and some say that things will only get worse. Quirin Schiermeier assesses the world's growing vulnerability to catastrophe.  In sheer numbers, the death toll of floods, earthquakes, tsunamis, volcanoes and cyclones is small \u2014 80,000 in an average year. Even the recent spate of catastrophes ranks surprisingly low among the scourges of humanity. With the Indian Ocean tsunami and the Kashmir earthquake, disasters in the past 12 months claimed more than 400,000 lives \u2014 the highest toll since 1970. But more than three times that number are estimated to have died on Earth's roads in the same period; more than twenty times as many died of avoidable childhood diseases. To dwell on the averages, however, is to miss the point. Catastrophes are not average; they are the great exceptions. Most of us have seen road-traffic accidents, but few of us have witnessed a natural disaster. They are ruptures with the everyday that change cities, countries and sometimes whole regions forever. They can even change patterns of thought. The Lisbon earthquake of 1755 and its associated tsunami, which struck while the city's churches were celebrating All Saints' Day, shook the faith of millions and altered that century's intellectual landscape irrevocably. It is the fact that they are rare and exceptional that makes it very hard to plan for natural disasters. Problems that crop up less than once a generation \u2014 even, in some cases, less than once a millennium \u2014 are easily overlooked. Experts can anticipate some natural disasters, but their predictions and assessments often count for little compared with the pressures of population and development, which increase the number of people in harm's way. As more people crowd the planet, particularly in vulnerable coastal areas, they risk disasters of unprecedented proportions. Hence the paradox that the twentieth century, benefiting from the most advanced technology in human history, saw more deaths due to natural disasters than any previous century had. There is even the chilling possibility that the current century will beat the previous one's tally of 3.5 million deaths. The science behind predicting disasters is uncertain. But with the best geological and meteorological knowledge in hand, along with models that assess the vulnerability of different populations (see  \u2018Insuring for disaster\u2019 ), experts are starting to quantify just how grim the future will be. Steve Sparks, a volcanologist at the University of Bristol, UK, has looked at analyses of current trends by the German reinsurance firm Munich Re. \u201cThe world can now expect three to five major events per year, which each kill more than 50,000 people,\u201d he says. The mechanisms behind these disasters are not new; the basic factors that underlie volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, cyclones and floods are well understood, and so is the geographic distribution of risk. But there are still three mysteries: where and when a disaster will strike; what unforeseen consequences there might be; and how to get policy-makers and the public at large to take the problems, and the uncertainties, seriously. Public preparedness rarely keeps pace with scientific knowledge. \u201cThe science,\u201d says Sparks, who recently organized a meeting on natural disasters at the Royal Society in London, \u201cis not getting through to policy-makers, planners and populations.\u201d US meteorologists had often warned that their worst-case hurricane scenario would involve a storm breaking the protective levees around low-lying New Orleans. And that's exactly what happened on 29 August with Katrina, which left 1,300 dead \u2014 the largest death toll from a natural disaster in the United States since the 1928 Okeechobee Hurricane. Geologists had long warned of the possibilities of large earthquakes along the Himalayan front, like the one that struck Kashmir in October, and in the Sumatran trench off Indonesia, where the tsunami was born last December.(See  box ) The very enormity of the Indian Ocean tsunami is, in fact, a good example of unforeseen consequences. The seismic risk in the area was known, but the scope of the resulting tsunami, which affected a dozen countries, was totally unexpected. Unlike in Hawaii and Japan \u2014 where tsunamis are a relatively frequent phenomenon, and where education projects and early-warning systems exist \u2014 many people in southeast Asia, India and eastern Africa had never even heard of such waves. The death toll was particularly high in the \u2018shadow zone\u2019 near the Equator, where tropical cyclones rarely occur and people have lived safely by the sea for centuries. Risk-management experts predict that a tsunami of similar scale is likely to happen only once every 500 years. Nevertheless, nations around the Indian Ocean are funding an early-warning system similar to the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center in Hawaii \u2014 the first set of buoys was installed last month. Critics charge that the technology could rust at the bottom of the ocean long before the next big wave strikes 1 , but to some extent this misses the point. Many holders of insurance never need to make a claim, but that doesn't mean it was silly to buy a policy. \n               History lessons \n             Letting the past be a guide to the future is not entirely satisfactory. Hemant Shah is the president of Risk Management Solutions (RMS), a company based in Newark, California, that constructs risk models for the insurance industry. He echoes the US defense secretary, Donald Rumsfeld: \u201cThe challenge for the industry really is to think about the unknown unknowns.\u201d More thinking along those lines might have led to a greater appreciation of the tsunami risk in the Indian Ocean. But analysis of the past does at least provide data for imagining future scenarios \u2014 experts can envisage the consequences of a repeat of the Lisbon earthquake, for example. (See  box )  A team led by Shinji Toda, of the Geologic Survey of Japan in Ibaraki, and Ross Stein, of the US Geological Survey in Menlo Park, California, has been re-evaluating seismic risks to Tokyo in light of past earthquakes. In a report submitted to the Japanese government, the researchers found that a replay of the 1855, magnitude-7.3 Tokyo earthquake that killed 7,000 people could devastate the city and send shocks through the world's financial markets. The problem is that no one understands the 1855 earthquake well enough to predict accurately when it might happen again, and thus to quantify the risk. \u201cThere's an enormous amount of uncertainty,\u201d says Stein. (See  box ) Tokyo's peculiar vulnerability to earthquakes, which arises from its position at the junction of three tectonic plates, is a chronic worry for the global financial system. But in casualty terms, there are places that concern seismologists more. The worst earthquake of the twentieth century, and possibly the worst in history, was China's Tangshan earthquake in 1976, which may have killed more than half a million people. Some seismologists think that the ever-growing cities in earthquake belts across Asia, many filled with unstable buildings, mean that a million-fatality earthquake is possible in the near future; Sparks mentions Istanbul, Tehran and Sumatra's Padang as likely sites. Tehran, a city of 12 million with what one expert at RMS calls \u201csome of the scariest construction known to man\u201d, is a particular worry: just as Tokyo has the potential for an earthquake with disproportionate financial impact, one in Tehran would have a huge geopolitical impact. \n               Floods of fire \n             Volcanic eruptions are also bound to do more damage in the future than in the past, simply because more people live in their path. Here some degree of warning is more likely than it is with earthquakes, but it cannot be relied on. And although cities such as Naples, at the foot of Italy's Mount Vesuvius, face the most obvious dangers, other situations could result in more deaths. Robert Muir-Wood, chief researcher at RMS, notes that a major tragedy could happen if an eruption reached a major city just outside an immediate evacuation zone, to which people had fled for shelter.(See  box ) An additional concern is that we have no historical experience of what a really large volcanic eruption might look like. The twentieth century's most lethal eruption, in Martinique in 1902, was far smaller than the giants of the nineteenth century. The 1883 eruption of Krakatoa in Indonesia obliterated the island and sent plumes of volcanic ash drifting around the globe for years, and the Tambora eruption of 1815 affected climate all over the world. Even mighty Krakatoa was at least an order of magnitude smaller than the Santorini eruption, which effectively wiped out the Minoan civilization in the eastern Mediterranean around 1400  BC . Hurricanes, by contrast, are more tractable. There are limits to their size and destructive power, they have seasons, and their tracks can be forecast with some degree of accuracy. They are also frequent enough for people to take seriously, especially if given the right sort of warnings and information. In the United States, the National Hurricane Center in Miami, Florida, is responsible for issuing storm warnings when Atlantic hurricanes threaten the coast. It now produces maps, available on the web and through television broadcasts, that forecast storm paths with an accuracy that has improved by 50% in the past 30 years. Most coastal residents pay attention only when a hurricane is threatening their particular part of the coast, so this information has to be targeted to the right place, at the right time and in the right way. \u201cMeteorology means nothing to 99% of my viewers,\u201d says Steve Lyons, a hurricane expert and anchorman of the popular US Weather Channel. \u201cWe need to translate the meteorology into impact. It's like telling people in a town very concretely: \u2018It's gonna blow your roof off, so you better run\u2019.\u201d  But it is not all about listening to the media. Teaching people how to notice warning signals from nature \u2014 such as shaking ground or a receding ocean \u2014 can save lives in all sorts of natural disasters. Other relatively simple measures include planning escape routes and evacuations, and reconsidering land use in regions threatened by floods, storms, landslides and avalanches. A 2004 World Bank report on the cost of natural disasters in the 1990s estimates that $40 billion invested in risk reduction and preparation could have cut the decade's final bill in half, from $535 billion to $255 billion. It also estimates that, over the past four decades, $3.15 billion invested in flood control by China has averted $12 billion in losses. Such mitigation strategies have worked to save lives most dramatically during floods, says Muir-Wood. In China, for instance, flood casualties have dropped throughout the century, in part because of investment in protection systems and evacuation plans. In the 1930s and 1940s, 4.4 million people died from flooding in China; in the 1950s and 1960s, that number dropped to 2 million, and by the 1970s and 1980s it was 14,000.(See  box ) Still, the Indian Ocean tsunami and Katrina have highlighted the failure of society as a whole to take preventative action, says Maxx Dilley, a geographer at the Disaster Reduction Unit of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in Geneva. From international organizations to local decision-makers, those in charge are realizing that they need to know how natural events become tragedies. \u201cA lot of things are coming to a head,\u201d says Dilley. \u201cThere is an international push to focus more on risk identification and management, as opposed to post-disaster emergency action.\u201d Several organizations, including the UNDP, the Red Cross and the International Strategy for Disaster Reduction, have recently published reports outlining improved risk-management strategies 2 , 3 , 4 . They emphasize putting more resources into preparedness \u2014 restricting the expansion of cities in earthquake-prone regions, for example. Science, says Dilley, should be the basis of all these activities. But the fragmented research community is not positioned to provide the right input, he adds: \u201cWhat you need are planner-friendly common views, as opposed to highly specialized scientific papers.\u201d To address the issue, a group of experts led by David King, Britain's chief science adviser, has suggested setting up an International Science Panel for Natural Hazard Assessment. Such a panel would function like the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, sorting through a flood of scientific information and creating a generally accessible summary of the latest findings. And the UNDP and World Bank are working with Columbia University's Earth Institute in New York on a project to identify high risks, and give governments and local planners the data to recognize them. \u201cThis is the kind of information,\u201d says Sparks, \u201cthat, had it been available ten years ago, would have allowed governments in southeast Asia to take precautions against the tsunami.\u201d \n                     Watching over the world's oceans \n                   \n                     On the trail of destruction \n                   \n                     Earthquake prediction: A seismic shift in thinking \n                   \n                     Mount Fuji: A sleeping giant stirs \n                   \n                     Montserrat residents \u2018lost faith\u2019 in volcanologists' warnings \n                   \n                     Risk Management Solutions \n                   \n                     United Nations Development Programme \n                   \n                     International Strategy for Disaster Reduction \n                   \n                     World Housing Encyclopedia \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Emma Marris travels to the coast to learn what might be saved \u2014 and what might not. Getting stuck was the highlight of the day. In Little Vermilion Bay, along Louisiana's fast-disappearing coast, researchers cherish every bit of land they can find. So when a boatload of scientists recently got stuck in chocolate-brown mud, they celebrated even as they struggled. \u201cWe got the boat through here last time,\u201d says Richard Raynie, a coastal-resources scientist at the Louisiana Department of Natural Resources (DNR), satisfied with the change. The Louisiana coast, a lacy delta plain known for its seafood, oil, alligators and hurricanes, is unravelling. Generations of engineering projects, designed to make the soggy floodplain habitable, have disrupted the processes that held the wetlands together. Water that once deposited sediments onto the Mississippi River Delta is now hustled into the Gulf of Mexico by levees and floodwalls. Canals let the sea into coastal marshes, bringing salinization and erosion. Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, which hit opposite ends of Louisiana this August, underscored the marsh's fragility. The storms exposed the choices that must be made about land used for habitat, real estate, hunting, fishing, seafood and oil. Now, with the momentary but fading attention of the nation, scientists who have long worked to beat back the sea are being asked to solve every problem at once: Can we save everything? What do we save first? What are the most effective methods? Where should the money come from? The resources of the marsh, as well as the infrastructure located there, are worth a lot in Louisiana, and the state has long fought to keep its land from dropping into the sea. But in the 1990s, Louisiana lost just over 60 square kilometres of coastal wetland each year \u2014 an area the size of a football field every half-hour. Katrina and Rita washed away another 260 square kilometres, according to early estimates by the US Geological Survey (USGS). \n               New bayou \n             Engineers have built a series of projects to try to hold on to the land. Among them is the Caernarvon water diversion, 25 kilometres south of New Orleans, where river water pours through a levee onto wetlands. It is a pale imitation of the flooding that once fed this area with sediment and freshwater. The diversion often flows at far less than its maximum capacity of 230 cubic metres per second \u2014 and since Katrina, it has not flowed at all because of a lack of electricity and other problems. Even under ideal conditions, estimates suggest, it will save only 65 square kilometres of land over 50 years. Even so, there are signs that Caernarvon is bringing freshwater marsh back to the region. As researchers' airboats glide across the water, dozens of alligators wake up. Freshwater plants, such as alligator weed and rattlebox, thrive. Roseate spoonbills mix with other birds. But since Katrina blitzed through this area, open water and soggy land have swapped places. The wind picked up acres of marsh and flung it about in tiny handfuls called marshballs. Researchers are debating how many \u2014 if any \u2014 of these balls will take root in open water, perhaps creating new marshland. The Caernarvon diversion opened in 1991, a year after Louisiana senator John Breaux got funding for coastal restoration. Now, a system of federal and state trust funds pays for such projects; even so, they restore only a small fraction of the lost wetlands. The Breaux money funded a series of restoration projects without an overarching vision. \u201cPeople began to ask: \u2018Do we have a big plan?\u2019\u201d says Gerald Duszynski, head of the DNR's office of coastal restoration and management. The result was a multi-agency plan called Coast 2050, stuffed with goals \u2014 protecting shoreline here, building a delta there, and diverting water all along the Mississippi. Not surprisingly, the federal government baulked at the $14-billion price tag. A short-term, $1.9-billion plan was drawn up. But the projects in that plan are not the integrated approach that the coast's problems demand, according to an evaluation released in November by the US National Research Council. Meanwhile, some of the projects made headway. In Little Vermilion Bay, near the Texas border, a $900,000 project built 23 long, thin islands, known as terraces, to slow coastal erosion. Over the past few years, a whole cast of typical marsh plants has arrived, perhaps just in time: Hurricane Rita hit the area, but the terraces were thickly vegetated and so suffered only minimal erosion. On a hot November day, DNR scientists David Castellanos and Dona Weifenbach work their way across the islands, recording every plant in metre-long segments. \u201c Alterniflora , bull tongue,  Phragmites , deer pea, alligator weed,\u201d Castellanos calls out. \u201cWe encourage everything that will hold its roots down,\u201d says Weifenbach. The terraces work in many ways. \u201cWe protect the shorelines, but we also gain acreage,\u201d says Castellanos. By catching sediment, the terraces create additional land. A little less than half a metre was laid down between 1999 and 2003. Now \u2014 as Raynie and his colleagues discovered \u2014 there is enough to beach a boat. \n               Different strokes \n             Few dispute that Louisiana should fight to keep its land; hunters and fishermen value the marsh as much as the environmentalists. But there is disagreement over what kind of strategies should be used. Put simplistically, engineers prefer hard structures such as levees and rock walls, biologists prefer freshwater diversions such as Caernarvon, and geologists prefer soft earthworks such as terraces. Each approach has its drawbacks. \u201cFor freshwater diversion really to work, it takes decades,\u201d says Shea Penland, a geologist at the University of New Orleans. Robert Twilley, a systems ecologist at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge, agrees that diversions take time, but argues that they are worth doing because they run cheaply and improve the marsh. Expensive earth-moving exercises are \u201cshort-term triage\u201d, he says \u2014 something to keep the problem from getting worse. One problem is where to get the earth from. \u201cYou can't just rearrange the resources \u2014 you need to bring in new resources,\u201d says Twilley. Some experts want to dredge up sediment from the sea floor and add it to the coast. In particular, a number of restoration experts have their eye on a huge vein of sand called Ship Shoal, 20 kilometres offshore. These include Mark Kulp, also of the University of New Orleans, who is in a floatplane over Plaquemines Parish south of the city. As one goes south, the strips of land get narrower and the wreckage worse. Ten weeks after Katrina, an ocean barge lies on its side on a levee. Houses are a few heaps of lumber on a slab, and the ground twinkles with broken glass. In Kulp's ideal world, this scenario would never happen again. The communities on the lower part of Plaquemines Parish would be moved to higher ground. \u201cWe need to be willing to cut our losses,\u201d he says. He calls this idea managed retreat, prioritizing which bits of land are worth the money and energy to save. The National Research Council study noted that some people may have to leave vulnerable areas. The ideal time to move people, Kulp suggests, would be now, as so many were uprooted by this year's storms. It's not clear whether the wetlands' sudden fame will improve the fortunes of the restorers. In June, Louisiana politicians scored nearly $90 million annually over four years for coastal restoration, in addition to the trust fund set up by the Breaux act. Legislators included $1.4 billion for coastal restoration in an early version of a budget bill. It remains to be seen if it will be part of the final version, which lawmakers hope to get out before the end of the year. \n               In rehab \n             Since Katrina, the state legislature has voted to combine hurricane protection and coastal restoration under one authority and, potentially, one trust fund. This makes Duszynski nervous. \u201cWe're worried that the pressure is going to be so heavy to build levees that the restoration will be left behind,\u201d he says. On the other hand, any windfalls for levee-building may possibly get redirected to restoration work. But money has to come soon, he warns. \u201cThe problem is that as time ticks on, the pressure is less to do anything,\u201d he says, \u201cand then we are back to begging for restoration money.\u201d At any rate, restoration is the wrong word for what these scientists are aiming for. None of them expect the levees and floodwalls to go. There is no one agreed map of what the coast should look like in the future. \u201cYou can restore, you can rehab, you can preserve,\u201d says Chuck Villarrubia of the DNR. \u201cReally what you want to do is set the habitats on a trajectory that is sustainable.\u201d Castellanos puts it another way: \u201cThe natural system has been altered, and you can't go back. The bottom line is that every time you increase that acreage, you get benefits \u2014 forage for fish, shoreline protection, and even aesthetic values for people.\u201d For every researcher who secretly wishes people would leave the marsh to the alligators, there is another who wants to use the tools of the restorer \u2014 rocks, sand, freshwater and mud \u2014 to engineer the coast they want. Coastal restoration, it is clear, is mostly coastal design. \n                     After Katrina: tracking the toxic flood \n                   \n                     Katrina boosts calls for conservation \n                   \n                     After the flood \n                   \n                     USGS Hurricane and Extreme Storm Impact Studies \n                   \n                     Louisiana Department of Natural Resources Office of Coastal Restoration and Management \n                   \n                     Main CWPPRA site \n                   \n                     Army Corps of Engineers site on the Caernarvon Diversion \n                   \n                     America's Wetland Campaign to Save Coastal Louisiana \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Carina Dennis investigates. First, there is the cowering in the darkness. Then the furtive scurrying and crouching against the wall. But what really grabs the attention of the former CIA agent is the nervous scratching. An expert in video surveillance, he is programming a computer to monitor these movements. But, unlike in his previous work, he is not tracking suspicious behaviour that could flag a possible terrorist or criminal. This time his attention is focused on the antics of a mouse. The expert, who won't reveal his identity, is collaborating with geneticist Mario Capecchi at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City to develop computer technology that will aid studies of psychiatric disorders in mice. The aim is to let researchers screen the behaviour of large numbers of mice without having to spend thousands of hours glued to a video monitor. Scientists hope that such developments will let them unleash the full power of mouse genetics on the challenging problem of human psychiatric disease. There is little doubt that genes play a significant role in psychiatric disorders; a raft of genes has been implicated in conditions such as depression and schizophrenia 1 , 2 . But tracking down these genes can be extremely difficult. And there is much to be learned about how the culprit genes that have been identified contribute to the onset and progression of the disorders. Studying the faulty genes is a challenge. For one thing, it is nearly impossible to do the kinds of genetic and molecular experiment needed to work out how these mutant genes cause disease in people. For another, researchers need good animal models in order to test and develop new drugs. \u201cThe big change for the field is being able to model the genetic aspects of psychiatric illness in mice,\u201d says Daniel Weinberger, a psychiatrist at the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) in Bethesda, Maryland, who is using mice to test different forms of a human gene implicated in schizophrenia. \n               Timid tendencies \n             The great advantage of mice is that, unlike rats, they can readily be genetically engineered \u2014 in this case, to carry a specific gene mutation known, or thought, to cause human disease. The engineered mice can then be rigorously tested to see how the mutant gene affects the animal's behaviour, cognition and physiology, and used to test new therapies. Breeding the mice with other strains can show whether a different genetic make-up influences the effects of the mutation. Their completed genome sequence and rapid reproduction also means mice are easy to screen in large numbers for new disease genes, whose equivalents can then be tracked down in people. But mice have a big drawback: they are extremely nervous creatures that become stressed when people are near. This makes it hard for scientists to tell whether a behaviour they observe is down to a mutant gene or, say, sheer fright. For that reason, most psychiatric work has, until now, focused on the more nonchalant rat. \u201cThe mouse has really been underestimated,\u201d says Tim Bussey, a behavioural neuroscientist at the University of Cambridge, UK. \u201cPeople think it is more difficult to do behaviour studies with mice than with rats, but it's often easier.\u201d Now, new screening technology and more sophisticated behavioural tests are giving the field a boost. Researchers are using a range of approaches to study how genes influence specific behaviours observed in psychiatric conditions. Some are targeting known genes, whereas others are randomly disrupting genes in the mouse genome and screening the resultant mutants for behavioural changes. Yet others are looking for natural behavioural variations in mouse strains and tracking down the culprit genes. But once armed with their chosen mice, geneticists face two key problems: the timidity of their subjects, and the question of how to interpret the behaviour they see. \n               Secret surveillance \n             To tackle the first problem, researchers have devised ingenious ways to achieve something like a Big Brother mouse house, where the mice can get up to their usual antics unaware that humans are monitoring their every rustle and tussle. To help Capecchi spy on mice, the CIA computer expert is automating the recording of highly repetitive actions in a mouse model of obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD); that is, the actions of mice that lack their normal  Hoxb8  gene 3 . \u201cWatching hours and hours of video footage was cumbersome \u2014 we needed to automate the process,\u201d says Capecchi. He plans to compare the behaviour of mice with different genetic alterations of  Hoxb8 , which are the same as those found in humans, to see how the different mutations affect mice's actions. He hopes this will help him to identify mutations that cause OCD and related conditions in humans. Capecchi also plans to use the technology to study abnormal social interactions in mice with an altered  Hoxa1  gene, which is implicated in autism. Other groups \u2014 such as that led by Hans-Peter Lipp at the University of Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland \u2014 have created a \u2018mouse hotel\u2019, which sleeps up to 16 mice and has a wide array of platforms and gadgets to test behaviour and social function. \u201cIt doesn't make sense to test mice that are isolated because usually they live in a social environment,\u201d says Lipp. A tiny microchip implanted in the back of each mouse's neck allows their movements and interactions to be automatically recorded 4 . \n               Seriously social \n             But unobtrusive researchers are still left with the second problem: diagnosing the mouse's behaviour. Although mice are good models for many aspects of human biology, it is unlikely that they could fully mimic all the complexities of a human psychiatric disease such as schizophrenia. Instead, researchers are breaking down these diseases into their simpler components, such as the anxiety involved in depression, or the lack of sociability associated with autism, and using mice to gain insights into the neurobiology underlying such traits. \u201cMice are a very social species so they are a good choice for modelling symptoms of autism,\u201d says Jacqueline Crawley, who heads the Laboratory of Behavioral Neuroscience at the NIMH. She developed her mouse sociability tests after watching autistic children interact at a clinic. Her tests involve a three-chambered apparatus (pictured), and each mouse is able to choose to spend time with a novel object or with a stranger mouse 5 , 6 . Normal mice would rather get acquainted with the stranger, but Crawley and her team have identified several inbred strains that, like autistic children, fail to show sociability. Geneticist Richard Paylor, of the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, Texas, and his team are also homing in on autism. Their approach is to study mice engineered to have a mutation in the gene  Fmr1 . Humans who don't express this gene suffer from a mental retardation condition called fragile-X syndrome, and up to 20% of patients with the syndrome also have autism. Paylor wants to understand why, when all the patients lack the same gene function, only some develop autism. He and his team have devised an experiment that tests whether a mouse's willingness to socialize stops when it is presented with a new mouse or a new environment; difficulties in dealing with new social situations is a characteristic of fragile X in humans. By crossing the mutant mice with different strains, Paylor and his colleagues have shown that some of the offspring avoid all social interaction, more typical of autism. They hope to identify the genes that exacerbate the fragile-X traits towards more severe autistic behaviour. \n               From mouse to man \n             Teasing out these crucial shifts in behaviour often requires subtle tests. Seth Grant, a geneticist from the Sanger Centre in Cambridge, UK, for example, is investigating how a gene encoding a protein called SAP102 contributes to learning and behaviour. This gene is mutated in humans with mental retardation 7 , but mice lacking SAP102 have less obvious defects. With training, the mice can overcome their learning deficit, but will keep on using the same strategy even when an easier option is available. So, although the animals can learn, they are relatively inflexible in the choices they make. But how far can you compare, say, anxiety in a mouse to anxiety in a human? Some researchers go as far as applying the same behavioural tests to humans and mice. Bussey, for example, has taken a standard touch-screen test used to assess cognitive function in humans and adapted it to mice. The mouse is shown two images on a screen (pictured) and learns that if it touches one, it gets a food pellet. Then experimenters reverse the rules to see how quickly the animal can adapt to change, an ability that is impaired in some human behavioural disorders. Mark Geyer, a psychopharmacologist at the University of California, San Diego, has turned the tables and applied a mouse test for exploratory behaviour \u2014 called an open-field test \u2014 to human patients. He has designed an environment for patients, in this case a bogus \u2018office\u2019, where they are asked to wait. Manic patients behave a lot like manic mice \u2014 hyperactively exploring the new environment. According to Geyer, these unpublished data will help to validate his mouse model, which, he hopes, will shed light on the biology of mania and schizophrenia. So although humans are clearly more complex than mice, perhaps the basic components of our behaviour are more similar than we would like to think. We might not have too long to wait before researchers can use mice to get inside our heads. \n                     Mice yield secret of maternal courage \n                   \n                     Study to probe genetics of depression \n                   \n                     Genes point to schizophrenia cells \n                   \n                     Antidepressants web focus \n                   \n                     Mouse genome web focus \n                   \n                     NIMH \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},
{"file_id": "438278a", "url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/438278a", "year": 2005, "authors": [{"name": "Geoff Brumfiel"}], "parsed_as_year": "2006_or_before", "body": "A protest by Chinese graduate students at Yale University has revealed the plight of a vulnerable workforce in US labs. Geoff Brumfiel investigates. Last month, Xuemei Han was at her wit's end. A second-year graduate student in the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at Yale University, she was facing expulsion. Efforts to transfer to the university's forestry school had failed, and it looked as though the 26-year-old might have to return to China within a matter of weeks. \u201cI had a lot of pressure on me, and I did not feel confident anymore,\u201d she says. In June, Han had been told that she was \u201cnot in good academic standing\u201d with her department \u2014 an accusation she disputed. She had passed her qualifying exams at the first attempt and, after a few more tries, her required language exam as well. So she did something that many Chinese graduate students would never dream of doing: on 20 October she filed a complaint against Yale, accusing the university of treating Chinese students unfairly. The only Chinese student in her department, Han wrote in her complaint that she suspected professors were reluctant to work with her because they thought she would need extra help preparing manuscripts and grant proposals. Her grievance quickly gained a high profile on campus and beyond. Three other graduate students filed supporting testimonials that detailed problems they had experienced in their departments, and just over half of the 274 Chinese graduate students at Yale signed a statement backing her. The case garnered media coverage in the United States and even made the evening news in China. Within a week, university administrators relented and allowed Han to transfer to the department of forestry, where she had found an adviser willing to support her. Yale flatly denies any accusations of discrimination against Chinese students. Department members and administration officials declined to comment on the details of Han's case for legal reasons, but in a statement, Yale spokesman Tom Conroy said: \u201cYale has a long standing tradition of being a welcoming and supportive university for international students, and especially those from China.\u201d Whether or not it was discrimination, Han's story taps into a rarely seen vein of discontent among Chinese students and postdocs across the country. Chinese nationals are by far the largest group of foreign academics working in US universities. Between 1985 and 2000, some 26,500 Chinese students earned science and engineering PhDs in the United States \u2014 more than double the number of students from all of Western Europe, according to the National Science Foundation. And a recent survey of postdocs by scientific research society Sigma Xi in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, showed that Chinese postdocs tend to work longer hours for less pay than their American counterparts (see graphic). \n               Culture shock \n             Many Chinese come to the United States to participate in cutting-edge research, but must first overcome language barriers, cultural differences and visa hassles. They frequently feel isolated from their US lab-mates. And although all graduate students are at the mercy of their advisers, foreign students are especially vulnerable. They lack alternative options, so a disagreement or funding problem is all that it takes for them to be sent back to China. \u201cA lot of people live in fear,\u201d says Cong Huang, president of the Association of Chinese Students and Scholars at Yale and a third-year graduate student in the statistics department. The high percentage of Chinese in the lab is no coincidence. US researchers are happy to recruit academically gifted Chinese scholars, while the best and brightest Chinese are drawn to the country by research opportunities that they cannot get at home. That opportunity is what brought Han from Inner Mongolia to Yale in 2003. She received her undergraduate and master's degree in ecology from Beijing Normal University, but had never travelled outside China. \u201cEcology research has only just started in China, so my professors recommended that I study here,\u201d she recalls. She was ecstatic when she learned that Yale had admitted her to a PhD programme with funding from a Fan Family Fellowship, which supports Chinese students. But shortly after arriving in the United States, Han ran into difficulty. Like many Chinese students, she had studied English extensively in China, but that training focused primarily on reading and writing, not speaking. \u201cThe first semester was very hard,\u201d she says. \u201cIn physics and other departments, there are other Chinese graduate students who can help, but I was the only one in my department.\u201d Han's experience is not unusual. Many Chinese students have trouble fitting in when they first reach the United States, according to Hongwen Zhu, a graduate student at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York. Zhu says many students are embarrassed to admit that they don't understand what is being asked of them, or they are reluctant to raise their concerns vocally with their professors. \u201cMost Chinese students tend to be very quiet, and this is a very big problem,\u201d he says. Han made steady progress in her language skills, but it came at a cost. She was unable to teach, a requirement of her department, and she had trouble finding a research adviser. \n               On the edge \n             Still, Han was shocked to learn in June that she was no longer in good standing with her programme. The department told her that without an adviser she would be expelled from the programme on 31 August. With help from members of the ecology department, Han eventually found someone who was willing to advise her in Yale's forestry school. But when she tried to transfer, she was informed that she would lose the Fan Family Fellowship. Foreign students and postdocs frequently run into these sorts of funding problems, says Ji-Cheng Wang, a postdoc cancer researcher at City of Hope Hospital in Duarte, California. Unlike American students, who can switch advisers if necessary, many foreigners are financially tied to their principal investigator (PI). \u201cIf anything happens to the PI then the student is put at risk,\u201d Wang says. This relationship can put students in a precarious position. When Wei Fu, not his real name, moved from Peking University to became a postdoc at a midwestern university, he was hoping for a chance to expand his own research career in biophysics. Instead, Fu's lab director asked him to devote most of his time to existing experiments. \u201cI didn't have much independence, I didn't feel free,\u201d he says. When Fu told the PI of his unhappiness, he found himself suddenly out of a job. He had just three months to scramble for a new position, or risk expulsion from the country. Eventually, he managed to find a position at a lab in California. \u201cYou can imagine that I was very stressed,\u201d he says. That stress has been exacerbated by recent US and Chinese immigration policy. Most international students and scholars get a multiple-entry visa for the duration of their studies, but Chinese students must reapply for a new visa every six months. That is an improvement over the old rules, which required students to reapply each time they left the country, but it still causes trouble for researchers such as Yangheng Zheng, a postdoc studying high-energy physics at the University of California, Los Angeles. While conducting graduate research at the University of Hawaii, Zheng frequently travelled between the United States and Japan, and each trip required a new visa both ways. \u201cIn three years I used up all of my passport's pages,\u201d he says. Although the situation is better now, there are still problems, he says. Two months ago, on his latest excursion to CERN, the European particle-physics lab, he ended up stuck in Geneva for three weeks waiting for a US security check. \n               Sink or swim \n             There is little consensus in the Chinese community over how serious these issues are. Some students and postdocs that  Nature  spoke to said they had not encountered significant problems, and many reported strong relationships with their advisers, who helped them resolve issues. \u201cThe people I know are very nice to me,\u201d says Ye Jin, a postdoc in molecular biology at the University of California, Berkeley. \u201cWhen I try to write papers and proposals my PI has been very patient and corrects my grammar. She has been very encouraging.\u201d \u201cLanguage is not a barrier if you are willing to learn,\u201d adds Grace Wong, the president of Student Vision, a Boston-based group that helps students find jobs in biotechnology. \u201cIf your skills are good and you're willing to work really hard, any boss will love you.\u201d But Huang disagrees. \u201cWe really appreciate that the university gives us the chance to come here and study,\u201d he says. \u201cBut even if you work hard, sometimes you still have the risk of being kicked out because of a funding problem or a disagreement with your adviser.\u201d Huang's group, together with Yale's Graduate Employees and Student Organization, is now asking for modifications to the university's grievance process for international students. Regardless of whether the issues are real or perceived, the United States has seen a decline in Chinese graduate students in recent years. First-time enrolments were down 8% in the 2003\u201304 school year \u2014 although they rose by 3% this year, according to the Council of Graduate Schools, a non-profit consortium of graduate educators. Heath Brown, director of research at the council, says that the decline was primarily the result of stricter visa policies after 11 September 2001, which made the United States seem less welcoming (see  Nature   427 , 190\u2013195; 2004). Brown sees this year's reversal as \u201cvery positive\u201d, but he adds that much needs to be done to improve the image of the United States among Chinese students and scholars. As for Han, now that Yale has allowed her to transfer to the forestry school and retain her fellowship, she says that she is \u201cvery happy\u201d. She hopes that her story will encourage others to speak up when they encounter trouble working or studying in the United States. \u201cMost students don't know even one example in which a student fought and won,\u201d she says. \u201cI hope that after me, more students will speak up for themselves.\u201d See Editorial,  page 258 . \n                     As one door closes... \n                   \n                     US extends security clearance for scholars \n                   \n                     US Visas in focus \n                   \n                     Yale University \n                   \n                     Yale Graduate Employees and Student Organization \n                   \n                     Sigma xi postdoc survey  \n                   \n                     Council of Graduate Schools \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

As the climate warms up, melting glaciers are threatening the livelihoods of millions. David Cyranoski reports. The mighty Himalayas straddle many countries and are home to a host of ethnic groups. But all along the mountain range, local communities are finding that they have at least one thing in common: their way of life is being threatened by changes to their environment. In Nepal, rising temperatures are swelling glacial lakes to bursting point. Across the mountains in Tibet, herdsmen are struggling to feed their livestock on an increasingly deteriorating landscape. In recent years, the locals have begun to blame global warming for many of their troubles \u2014 and the data now being collected suggest that they may be right. \u201cLocal people do not know much about climate change, but they can very clearly see that there is a change affecting them,\u201d says Lifeng Li, at the China branch of conservation group the WWF. Billions of people rely on water that ultimately comes from the Himalayas. The range is home to the 14 highest peaks in the world, and the area's snowpack feeds the flow of several major rivers. Hydrological models 1  suggest that the effects of climate change in the region could be far-reaching. And reports published earlier this year paint a grim picture of vanishing glaciers and declining water supplies 2 , 3 . Future disasters could include floods, droughts, land erosion, biodiversity loss, and changes in rainfall and in the annual monsoon. As a result, scientists and conservation groups are monitoring the region and asking what can be done to help its inhabitants to adapt to the changes. \n               Swept away \n             Both sherpa mountain guides in Nepal and and cattle herdsmen in Tibet stand to benefit from these initiatives. Climate change can have an immediate and disastrous effect on their lives. In 1985, Nawa Jigtar, a senior monk in the village of Ghat in Nepal, heard a loud noise and rushed outside, only to watch helplessly as his cows were carried away by a deluge. \u201cIf it had come at night, none of us would have survived,\u201d he told the WWF in a recent documentary,  Meltdown in Nepal . That flood occurred when the Dig Tsho glacial lake burst its banks, wiping out more than a dozen bridges as well as a new hydroelectric plant. Studies by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and others have shown that at least 20 such glacial lakes are at risk of bursting in Nepal 4 , with more in Bhutan. The lakes form naturally from the meltwater of glaciers, but as climate change forces the glaciers into an ever-faster retreat, the excess water floods into the lakes. Fragile moraine dams \u2014 piles of rock and debris left by the retreating glacier \u2014 are all that stand between the water and the communities downstream, says Shardul Agrawala, a climate-change administrator at the OECD. Earthquakes, landslides or slope instability can trigger the natural dams to collapse. And the problem seems set to get worse. In March, a WWF team reported on how quickly the Himalayan glaciers are melting 2 , and what consequences that might have for water supply in India, China and Nepal. Temperatures in Nepal have been rising steadily over the past few decades, and climate-change models predict that they will rise a further 1.2\u00b0C by 2050, with a total increase of 3 \u00b0C by 2100. As a result, the glacial lakes are growing in both number and size. \u201cMost glaciers are in retreat, so glacial lakes have to hold more water,\u201d says Ninglian Wang, a glaciologist at the Cold and Arid Regions Environmental and Engineering Research Institute (CAREERI) in Lanzhou, China. Nepal's glaciers are shrinking at a rate of 30 to 60 metres per decade 4 . On the Tibetan side of the range, 50% of the glaciers were retreating during the period 1950 to 1980 \u2014 that rose to 90% in the 1980s and to 95% in the 1990s 2 , according to data gathered by Tandong Yao, head of the Chinese Academy of Sciences' Institute of Tibetan Plateau Research based in Beijing. The runoff from melted glaciers in China is now roughly equal to the annual flow of the Yellow River. \u201cMelting glaciers are one of the most convincing pieces of evidence for the impact of climate change,\u201d says Nigel Arnell, a specialist in climate resources at the University of Southampton, UK. But the picture isn't so clear when it comes to other data, such as the cause of land deterioration in Tibet. This summer, a team from CAREERI sponsored by Greenpeace documented shrinking glaciers and lakes in the source region for the Yellow River 3 , which rises on the Tibetan plateau and is a crucial water resource for millions of Chinese. The group found that the region is experiencing vegetation loss of 3\u201310% each year. If the trend of rising temperatures continues, the team predicts a decrease in water availability of 20\u201340% over the next 50\u2013100 years, and a fall in total agricultural output including wheat, rice and corn crops of 10% by 2030\u201350. \n               Down to earth \n             But the question of land use \u2014 particularly overgrazing \u2014 is complicating the picture. The locals tend to reject the idea that they are partly to blame for the deterioration. For instance, Tibetan herdsmen near the source of the Yangtze River, who were interviewed by WWF researchers, were adamant that global warming had ruined the amount and quality of their grasslands, as well as increased the spread of disease from animals such as rats. And one of the main findings of the subsequent report 2  put together by members of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, was to correct the notion that overgrazing had destroyed the ecosystem. Most scientists, however, believe that overgrazing is playing a major role in the vegetation loss \u2014 the question is how much. The issue highlights one of the major problems in assessing the changes caused by global warming. Anecdotal surveys form the bulk of the data for these regions, and experts warn against relying too heavily on this kind of evidence. The regional studies are often not rigorous, notes Martin Parry, a senior research fellow at Britain's Met Office. \u201cEven if you can estimate the climate change, you can look at what the impact would be on agriculture today, but agriculture in the future will be different,\u201d he says. \u201cYou need to take into account social, economic and political change.\u201d Occasionally, local governments have taken the initiative to try to mitigate the effects of climate change. In February, the Chinese government allotted 7.5 billion renminbi (US$930 million) for conservation projects in the source regions of the Yangtze and Yellow rivers. To solve the problem of land degradation, officials are talking about relocating many of the Tibetan herdsmen, says Li. He argues that such an approach would be too costly, both financially and in terms of its cultural impact. \u201cWe should try to improve productivity of the land rather than move people,\u201d Li says \u2014 perhaps by selecting more robust species of grass and improving irrigation in the region. \n               Peak practice \n             Dealing with the threat of glacial lakes is a little more straightforward \u2014 if there is money available. Beginning in 1998, the Netherlands spent US$3 million to drain Tsho Rolpa, one of Nepal's most dangerous glacier lakes. The project lowered the water level by 3 metres, but the respite is only temporary, warns Agrawala. Meltwater is likely to fill it up again shortly, he notes. A new book from the OECD that examines the situation in Nepal 4  suggests other measures, such as early warning systems for floods to reduce the risk to local communities. It also proposes using smaller hydroelectric plants spread out on several rivers, rather than relying on one major plant that could be wiped out in a single lake burst, as happened in 1985. Such solutions are just one approach to a multifaceted problem. Regional policy-makers must juggle social and economic needs while worrying about how to adapt in the face of global warming. \u201cThere is a lot of talk of climate change, but how do you tell national planners to take it into account?\u201d asks Agrawala. One possible solution could be a new adaptation fund, to be considered when member states of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change meet in Montreal starting on 28 November. The framework would provide funding, insurance and technology transfer to developing countries whose geography puts them at risk from climate change \u2014 such as countries prone to drought, and those with mountainous ecosystems. Regardless of what aid it could get in the future, China may already be getting a taste of things to come. In Qumalai County, near the headwaters of the Yangtze, wells have recently gone dry and smaller rivers have vanished completely. If climatologists are correct, these water shortages may be a harbinger of the future along the Himalayas.

At one brand new base, astronomers are braving the extreme cold to build telescopes that they hope will rival space observatories. Gabrielle Walker investigates. For the thirteen residents of Antarctica's newest scientific base, the winter is finally over. In early November, after nine months of isolation in temperatures dropping to 80 degrees below zero, the first relief planes arrived bearing fresh food, letters and \u2014 perhaps the biggest blessing of all \u2014 new faces. On the relatively balmy Antarctic coastline, there are many permanent bases, but Concordia is the first year-round station to be built in the interior for 50 years. The site has been used by summer visitors since 1995 for a European ice-coring project, which was successfully completed last December 1 . This year, the first winter crew spent most of the dark months working to finish the wiring and plumbing of their brand new home \u2014 a joint venture between the French Polar Institute Paul Emile Victor (IPEV) and the Italian Antarctic Research Programme (PNRA). But they haven't laboured solely on construction jobs. Astronomer Karim Agabi from the University of Nice in France, part of Concordia's first winter crew, has good news to report about the site's potential for optical astronomy. Although more problematic than first thought, Concordia could be one of the best places in the world to site an optical telescope. The stars shine uncommonly steadily there, Agabi says. \u201cYou really have the impression that they're stuck to the sky\u201d. The high Antarctic plateau has many potential advantages for astronomy, such as little atmospheric water vapour to distort incoming light. The US National Science Foundation, based in Arlington, Virginia, has been exploiting this potential for decades at the South Pole, which proved to be excellent for observing microwaves, but astronomers have been frustrated in their attempts to observe ordinary visible light. One reason is the frequent auroras, which interrupt any serious star gazing. \n               Eternal night \n             A bigger problem is that the South Pole lies on a slope, so winds tumble down from on high, generating a layer of turbulent air more than 200 metres thick. Turbulent winds aggravate what astronomers call \u2018seeing\u2019, a measure of the jitter they observe in starlight as it passes through packets of air of different temperatures before reaching the telescope. Concordia, in contrast, sits on a flat-topped dome of ice where there is almost no wind. The base is also outside the normal region for auroras. And unlike other high spots in Antarctica, Concordia is relatively easy to reach. During the summer, people and sensitive equipment can be transported by ski-equipped planes from the Italian coastal station at Terra Nova Bay. Meanwhile, heavier material can be hauled over the ice by tractors from the French coastal base of Dumont d'Urville, 1,100 kilometres away (see map). Many astronomers hoped that the seeing at Concordia would rival that available in space, but be much cheaper, with the additional benefit that humans would be on hand to fix equipment; transport costs on the traverse are just a few euros per kilogram, compared with many thousands for a space mission. Agabi and other researchers from the University of Nice have been testing the site for the past five summers. Their white telescopes stand on a stylish 8-metre platform, graced with an arch modelled on the base of the Eiffel Tower \u2014 a design that one of the astronomers, Eric Aristidi, calls \u201cthe French touch\u201d. Alas, the architect's original vision was compromised a little when he persuaded the firms providing materials to hand over two of everything for the price of one, so now two golden arches stand side-by-side. As Aristidi acknowledges: \u201cThe idea was to copy the Eiffel Tower, not McDonald's\u201d. The group's summer results seemed promising, using bright test stars visible despite the 24-hour daylight. Although seeing was poor at midnight, when the sun was at its lowest, by mid-afternoon it was significantly better than at any other ground-based site. There were hopes that seeing would improve further during winter darkness when optical astronomy would be possible. An automated Australian telescope left at Concordia during the 2004 winter reported seeing conditions that seemed to rival those observed in space 2 . \n               Star gazers \n             But not everything went according to plan for the Australians. Left unattended, in a bulbous green building known as \u2018the kiwi fruit\u2019, the instruments stopped working after a few months, and the group only obtained data up to 5 May, just one day after the beginning of the permanent winter night. Also the instruments were sensitive only to the seeing from 30 metres upwards. Nobody knew what was happening closer to the ground. So this year, Agabi volunteered to test the Nice telescopes during winter. An Antarctic veteran used to working at temperatures of \u221240 \u00b0C, Agabi discovered that winter was quite another challenge. Going outside, the crew risked instant frostbite. Faces and hands were worst off. As temperatures dropped below \u221270 \u00b0C, face masks frosted over in seconds, but working without them was unbearable. \u201cEverybody got burned,\u201d Agabi says. Fiddly tasks such as changing screws became interminable using thick mittens, yet the researchers could slip them off and work with glove liners for only a few seconds at a time. On a mild night, perhaps only \u221260 \u00b0C, Agabi would venture outside to admire the sky and take photos. He felt confident that they were going to have a good winter. But to Agabi's dismay, as winter darkness approached, the seeing seemed to grow steadily worse. \u201cI told myself, that's normal, the atmosphere just needs to settle down,\u201d he says. However, by the end of May, after four weeks of complete darkness, he realized there was a serious problem. How could the seeing be so poor when the Australian instruments had found it to be exceptional? Agabi launched weather balloons to measure the amount of turbulence from the ground upwards 3 . He discovered that around 90% of the turbulence at Concordia lay below 30 metres. \u201cThe Australians started just above the interesting part,\u201d says Aristidi. Concordia's turbulence is caused by an extremely steep temperature difference between the snow and the air above it. The air contains scarcely any water vapour \u2014 the Earth's principle greenhouse gas \u2014 and therefore retains little of the Sun's warmth. So the switch from 24-hour daylight to total darkness has little effect on its temperature. The snow, however, a much better heat-retainer during summer, steadily loses heat during the winter darkness, cooling the air immediately above, and creating layers of air at different temperatures. Although the air at Concordia is extremely still, the slightest breeze ruffles the layers, making stars viewed through a telescope skip frustratingly from side to side. Although Agabi was disappointed with his findings, they weren't yet disastrous; many telescopes are built on platforms 25 metres high. But to be sure that the layer stayed reliably low during the winter, Agabi needed to make continuous measurements. So in early July, with only five weeks of darkness left, Agabi persuaded the station manager to let him put a telescope on the roof of Concordia, at a height of 24 metres. It was a difficult project. The roof slopes and the only access is a narrow spiral staircase with an overhead trapdoor. The Concordia team had to build a platform for the telescope in complete darkness and at temperatures of nearly \u221280 \u00b0C. \n               Towering task \n             The results were worth it. At last, from its vantage point above the turbulence, the telescope recorded the exceptional seeing for which the astronomers had hoped. \u201cThe window was dirty but I have cleaned it,\u201d Agabi says. \u201cAnd through it I've seen the true quality of the site.\u201d Back in Nice, Agabi's colleagues are busy thinking of ways around Concordia's unexpected turbulence layer: a large windbreak or a new form of adaptive optics that might counteract the stars' skipping. At Concordia the wind comes mostly from the same direction, so a single barrier might prevent even the faintest breeze from stirring the air. If neither of these options work, the answer would be to build towers. \u201cAt 30 metres we'd have practically the same performance as in space,\u201d says Aristidi. John Storey, from the University of New South Wales in Sydney, who is a member of the Australian team, agrees. \u201cThirty metres is a bit disappointing, but it's not a show-stopper,\u201d he says. \u201cMost of the world's 4-metre telescopes are at 30 metres or so above the ground.\u201d His team has begun to model the aerodynamics of potential towers and snow-hills on which a future telescope could be sited. Aristidi has already arrived in Antarctica to take over from Agabi in preparation for Concordia's second winter. With him are instruments to locate the turbulent layers more precisely, and to take infrared measurements. The cold temperatures and absence of water vapour mean that background infrared noise should be very low even in summer. A group from the University of Perugia in Italy hopes to have an infrared telescope installed by January 2007. In the longer term, suggestions for big astronomical projects at Concordia are plentiful. One idea is to build an array of 50 small telescopes, which could look for Earth-like planets. The only rival technology at the moment involves space launches, although if every single telescope needs a high platform, the project could lose its appeal. In that case, Agabi thinks that one very large dish might be the answer. Constructing a single tower would be easier, and they could transport large components overland. Either way, he says, it is important to think big. \u201cIt really is a super site,\u201d he says, \u201cand it's going to be worth truly grand projects.\u201d \n                     Antarctic deemed perfect for stargazing \n                   \n                     Antarctic stations: Cold comfort \n                   \n                     Eight glacial cycles from an Antarctic ice core \n                   \n                     First winter at Dome C \n                   \n                     The Dome C Project \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

But can the state pull off an even more ambitious goal and slash its greenhouse-gas emissions? Charles Petit finds out. Arnold Schwarzenegger has a mission: he wants to terminate global warming. In June, the California governor called for the state to slash its greenhouse-gas emissions to 80% of 1990 levels in the next 45 years. \u201cThe debate is over,\u201d he said in a forthright speech in San Francisco. \u201cWe know the science. We see the threat. And we know the time for action is now.\u201d This was fighting talk, but if any advanced economy can pull off such drastic cuts in emissions, this high-technology Pacific Rim state and its 36 million residents probably can. Schwarzenegger has help. His muscle for the job is a team of state energy-conservation experts who have been in the business for years. And first among them is his polar opposite: a short, skinny physicist named Arthur Rosenfeld. More than three decades ago, Rosenfeld helped to trigger the state's successful fight to cut energy consumption; today he is one of the five members of California's Energy Commission. Rosenfeld was Enrico Fermi's last graduate student and he spent decades as a physics professor at the University of California, Berkeley. He now commutes weekly between his home overlooking San Francisco Bay and Sacramento, the capital, in an energy-saving Prius hybrid sedan that the state provides. The Energy Commission's job isn't easy: to help the most populous US state figure out how it might cut greenhouse-gas emissions and make money doing it. \n               Under control \n             In his office, Rosenfeld pulls out a data plot of which he is particularly fond. It shows electricity consumption per capita from 1960 to 2002, with one line for California and one for the United States. In 1960, both lines sit at 4,000 kilowatt-hours per person. They rise at roughly the same pace to about 7,000 kilowatt-hours in the early 1970s. But at the point when the US energy crisis struck that decade, the lines diverge dramatically: California virtually flatlines its energy use per citizen \u2014 even though its economy was outpacing the rest of the nation. The state's electricity use per capita today is the lowest in the nation at 6,800 kilowatt-hours, compared with 12,800 kilowatt-hours for the country overall. The strategies that helped California achieve those conservation goals may now help it in its greenhouse-gas cuts. State energy experts, including Rosenfeld, don't foresee California adopting many radical new technologies to meet its ambitious goals. Rather, a steady application of proven technologies should do much of the job. The governor is a real-life climate action hero today. Nancy Ryan, Environmental Defense California's $1.5-trillion gross annual product makes it the world's sixth largest economy, behind France and ahead of Italy. It is the planet's ninth-largest emitter of greenhouse gases. \u201cCalifornia is not an insignificant actor, and we are seen as a world leader in protecting the environment,\u201d says Eileen Tutt, a senior officer at the California Environmental Protection Agency. \u201cNot to take action sends a very strong signal.\u201d Still, the governor's pledge, made on the United Nations World Environment Day, caused more than a few jaws to drop. Schwarzenegger is a tax-cutting Republican who owns several fuel-slurping Hummers and is deeply suspicious of government regulation. Beset by budget fights and union opposition, he has sagged in popularity with the state's generally Democratic voters since his election two years ago. But his energy policies, building on those of a string of governors of both parties, get him kudos from longtime activists. \u201cThe governor is a real-life climate action hero today,\u201d Nancy Ryan, a senior economist with the group Environmental Defense, told reporters after his speech. Specifically, Schwarzenegger vowed that California will cut its greenhouse-gas emissions to below 2000 levels by 2010 and to less than the 1990 level of 373 million tonnes by 2020. But then the governor added the final, ambitious goal to cut emissions by a further 80% by 2050. \n               Out on a limb \n             His policy stands in stark contrast to that of the federal administration under President George W. Bush, who has refused to ratify the Kyoto Protocol to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions. The president has said that such action would squeeze the US economy too much. California officials say that they can do it while boosting the economy and creating jobs. The state's strong environmental policies in the past, they point out, occurred while its economy thrived. Success will require the cooperation of several interlocking agencies. The Energy Commission plays a major role, as do the state's Environmental Protection Agency, Air Resources Board and Public Utilities Commission. Schwarzenegger's proclamation renewed their \u201cabsolute licence to go out and make California a model country for greenhouse policies\u201d, says Stephen Schneider, a physicist and climate-policy analyst at Stanford University. State officials have much at stake. California's climate could change utterly if a warmer world redirected storm paths (see  Nature   430 , 818; 200410.1038/430818b ). Rising temperatures could cause winter rain instead of snow in the Sierra Nevada mountains, triggering floods for which the state's aqueducts and dams are not prepared. Plus, its coast is vulnerable to a rise in sea level. Other states have also recognized their vulnerability to climate change, and have independently taken climate policy into their own hands. Local legislators, from mayors of cities to state governors, have begun their own versions of Kyoto-like regulations (see B. Fisher and R. Costanza  Nature   438 , 301\u2013302; 2005). In the northeast, nine states have agreed to cap carbon dioxide emissions from more than 600 power plants in the region (see  Nature   437 , 11; 2005). On the west coast, California has joined with Oregon and Washington in a governors' initiative to encourage energy efficiency and conservation. But of all the states, California has set itself up as a model of how diligent attention to efficiency can take root and pay off. Its example has caught on: in recent years many other states have adopted California's standards for car pollution rather than the more lax federal standards. And the state is now attracting international attention. In September, its Public Utilities Commission, Energy Commission and the Pacific Gas and Electric Company signed a pact with China's Jiangsu province to train officials and utility executives in energy-conservation tactics. Earlier this month, Schwarzenegger led a sales delegation to China to tout the state's energy-saving technologies, and another team from the state's Air Resources Board travelled to Belgium to brief European air-quality experts on energy policies. California's approach to energy conservation has helped it save money. The state sets electricity rates for private utilities, and sometimes provides subsidies to help power companies induce customers to cut their consumption. If they do, the state gives money back to the companies \u2014 through rate adjustments and other payments \u2014 that makes up for what the firms would have earned had they built additional power plants. The Energy Commission calculates that the total power bill for residents is about $16 billion lower each year than if the state had not launched its conservation campaign. Conservation has also managed to prevent some 18 million tonnes of carbon pollution being emitted from power plants \u2014 equivalent to taking 12 million cars off the roads. After allowing for the cost of measures such as changed building practices, appliances and subsidies, the net saving is about $12 billion. And deeper energy cuts should pay more, the commission says. The Air Resources Board estimates that planned reductions in greenhouse-gas emissions by 2020, from motor vehicles alone, could save Californians $256 million annually by 2010 (mostly from smaller fuel bills), and $4.8 billion annually by 2020. \n               Cut and dried? \n             But will the state's longer-term emissions policy succeed? Schneider is unsure how cost-effective the whole plan will be. Earlier stages may pay for themselves, he says, but the final leap to the 80% cut is unlikely to come without costs. \u201cIt would take a total revamp of our fuel infrastructure,\u201d he notes. So far, even state planners aren't sure how they will meet the later goals. \u201cWe don't have the details, but we'll have a report to the governor's office in January,\u201d says Tutt. Some fresh ideas are already in the works. One notion, set out by Schwarzenegger's administration, is to place 1 million solar-panel systems on rooftops by 2018. California gets about 11% of its electricity from geothermal, wind, biomass and solar units; for the United States overall, the number is around 2%. California aims to increase its share of renewable sources to 20% by 2010 and to 33% by 2020. Also helpful will be the vehicle clean-up legislation enacted just before Schwarzenegger's arrival. This requires car manufacturers, starting in 2009, to cut greenhouse-gas emissions from new cars and trucks by 22% by 2013 and 33% by 2017. But the law remains in dispute \u2014 perhaps predictably, car companies have sued. They argue that carbon dioxide is not a pollutant, and that regulating it at state level would pre-empt federal control over the fuel-efficiency standards in new cars. In the long run, the governor has chosen hydrogen-fuelled cars as his personal crusade. Wind power figures large in state plans. California pioneered wide-scale use of it and already has more than 14,000 wind turbines. In a good breeze their combined capacity is 2,100 megawatts \u2014 about the same as two nuclear power plants. State energy officials estimate that wind alone, in principle, can generate an additional 30,000 megawatts. \n               Fuel for thought \n             The rest of the renewable energy would probably come from beefed-up geothermal, solar and biomass facilities. In recent weeks, the utility company serving San Diego contracted to buy another 205.5 megawatts of wind power, and the Los Angeles utility company ordered 500 megawatts of solar power from a complex being built some 120 kilometres northeast of the city. When construction is completed in 2013, this will be the world's largest solar facility and will more than double US solar-energy generation. One energy source that is not on the agenda, despite not emitting greenhouse gases, is nuclear power, which now provides about 10% of the state's electricity. California law forbids the construction of additional nuclear plants until safe, long-term waste storage has been assured. If Schwarzenegger's emissions-busting goal seems ambitious, Rosenfeld is happy to put it in perspective. He recalls the early days of conservation work when he co-founded a programme in energy-efficient buildings at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. The effort spawned what today is an entire Environmental Energy Technologies Division at the lab. Back then, Rosenfeld's personal project was to make fluorescent lights more efficient. Around the same time, in 1973, state lawmakers formed the California Energy Commission, which was signed into existence by then-Governor Ronald Reagan. In its early days, the commission took almost as gospel any reports from Rosenfeld's group on how to reduce energy demand. In 1978, the state used the team's recommendations as a guide to impose energy requirements on new buildings. Appliance standards came two years later governing such items as gas furnaces, air conditioning and refrigerators. Today, due largely to such regulations, refrigerators use a third of the electricity and cost about a third as much to buy as in the early 1970s. In contrast to California's efforts, federal standards, such as \u2018Energy Star\u2019 labels for approved appliances, did not arrive until the 1990s. \n               Energetic response \n             The total electricity used for air-conditioning new homes in California is now a third of what it was in the 1970s. And two technologies from the Lawrence Berkeley initiative \u2014 the revamped light bulb and window coatings that keep heat out in the summer and in during winter \u2014 will save the US economy some $23 billion in utility bills, the National Academy of Sciences has estimated. Rosenfeld is not done waging war on wasted energy. He is pushing hard for regulations to encourage the use of white roofs, or at least coloured ones, that reflect most near-infrared radiation. Such cool roofs could save $200 million yearly in air-conditioning costs in Los Angeles alone. He frets over energy \u201cvampires\u201d, the trickle of power that modern appliances continue to suck through their plugs even when they are turned off. Such vampires include televisions waiting for a signal from the remote, cable boxes, modems, recharging cell phones, cordless phones, garage-door openers waiting for a signal and stereos. Standby power, which was insignificant two decades ago, now typically accounts for 10% of a home's electricity use. New technology that gives appliances more efficient standby modes, which California will require as it becomes available, could reduce this by 75%. \u201cLet me show you something,\u201d Rosenfeld says as he pulls out an iconic NASA satellite image of the Western Hemisphere at night. The US industrial centres blaze like constellations against the black backdrop of the continent. \u201cYou are looking at millions of light bulbs,\u201d he says in dismay. To Rosenfeld, the necklaces of light are not signs of advanced civilization but of a wastrel society leaking precious photons into the void. Then, Rosenfeld leans forward with a conspiratorial air. \u201cIn the next 20 years,\u201d he declares, \u201cCalifornia will disappear.\u201d And that is Rosenfeld's dream \u2014 that the state will disappear, or at least fade, at night. Rules enacted this year require new lights for streets, parking areas and the like to focus 98% of their illumination on the ground, not into the sky. Once again, Rosenfeld says, the message for California on saving energy is simple: every little bit helps. \n                     Carbon dioxide storage holds limited promise \n                   \n                     Governors take the initiative over US carbon dioxide emissions \n                   \n                     Senate hearings strengthen calls for US action over climate \n                   \n                     Climate modellers go local to target California's politicians \n                   \n                     Energy: Nuclear power's new dawn \n                   \n                     California Energy Commission \n                   \n                     California Climate Change Portal \n                   \n                     Pew Center on Global Climate Change summary of state-level US activities \n                   \n                     California Environmental Protection Agency page on its Climate Action Team \n                   \n                     California Public Utilities Commission site on climate change \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

But can they prevail? Emma Marris finds out it's not all black and white. Chesapeake bay in Virginia played host to some of the first British colonists. And along the banks of the York River, crumpled beer cans and someone's soggy hunting cap bear witness to their success. Another colonial type has also put down roots by the river: a few feet above the high-tide line sit some feathery reeds. They are  Phragmites australis  \u2014 and they are the enemy. This strain, thought by some to have been introduced from Europe a century or so ago, is now classified as an invasive species \u2014 one which aggressively steals habitat from native flora. Today, the reeds will come under attack from an invasive-species strike team. Armed with high-tech gear, these specialists travel from park to park \u2014 all-terrain vehicle in tow for the off-road areas \u2014 ready to pull, poison or burn anything that is out of place. Since their inception in 2000, the National Park Service's strike teams have treated some 270,000 hectares. But success depends on the yardstick one uses: plant seeds can survive for decades and most invasives return sooner or later, often within a few years of treatment. Some ecologists even question the rationale behind the entire approach. Dressed in a pale khaki uniform and thigh-high waders, Kate Jensen is carefully recording the exact location of the  Phragmites  using a hand-held global positioning device, which chirps merrily when it reaches enough satellites. Half an hour later, her teammates \u2014 Dale Meyerhoeffer and Matthew Overstreet \u2014 arrive with a 200-gallon tank of a herbicide called Habitat. The team mixed the chemical early in the morning and added a fluorescent blue dye that will make it obvious which plants have been hit. The aim, Jensen says, is to make the area liveable for native plants. She points to a handful of cattails behind the  Phragmites . \u201cThat's what we want here. We like those.\u201d The Park Service's 16 exotic-plant management teams were conceived as a way to spread scant resources over hundreds of US national parks. Each team covers a wide area \u2014 this one handles the mid-Atlantic region, which stretches 550 kilometres from Pennsylvania to Virginia. The teams are made up of park employees, contractors, conservation students and volunteers, whose shared goal is to wrestle the parks back into something like their pre-colonial condition. To this end, the mid-Atlantic team goes after tree-of-heaven ( Ailanthus altissima ) from China and autumn olive ( Elaeagnus umbellata ), an east Asian import once planted to fatten game birds. They also tackle privets ( Ligustrum  spp.) \u2014 hedgerow plants that form dense thickets and compete with natives \u2014 and mile-a-minute weed ( Polygonum perfoliatum ), whose name betrays its bad habit. \n               Cutting costs \n             The introduction of such alien plants is a growing concern worldwide, as international travel and shipping accelerate the spread of seeds and cuttings around the globe. Among the most damaging additions to the United States are leafy spurge ( Euphorbia esula ), which has rendered great swathes of western prairie useless for grazing, and salt cedar ( Tamarix  spp.), which depletes groundwater and moves salt to the soil surface. Crews cutting the cedars back with chainsaws report a salty taste on their tongues as they work. The cost of the damage is estimated to run into tens of billions of dollars each year. And these figures do not take into account intangibles such as loss of fresh water or recreation opportunities, says Mike Ielmini, invasive-species coordinator for the US Forest Service, based in Washington DC. \u201cUntil we get some definitive studies, it is going to be very hard to say how much it costs the United States,\u201d he says. In the face of such economic damage, the US government's response has been increasingly aggressive. In 1999, President Bill Clinton signed an executive order that crystallized the approach to invasive species: all agencies were to avoid spreading them and to stamp them out, wherever possible. Today, the federal government spends more than $1 billion annually controlling invasive species 1 . But is such large expenditure necessary? Although many thousands of plant species have accompanied human migrations to new lands, most manage to coexist in one way or another with what is already there. Only a small percentage are truly invasive, pushing out the native flora and altering the local ecology. And although the prevailing ethos says that all invasives should be eliminated, not all ecologists agree. \n               Required weeding? \n             Removing invasives is more a human preference than a scientifically grounded prerogative, argues Mark Davis, an ecologist at Macalester College in St Paul, Minnesota. \u201cThere is a huge amount of arbitrariness here,\u201d he says. \u201cCan't we just forget about where they came from, identify species that are causing us problems according to our values, and then deal with them?\u201d Although invasives have been called the second most serious threat to endangered species after habitat loss 2 , a recent review of the literature suggests that there are few solid data to support this idea 3 . Many ecologists now agree that invasive plants, in particular, seldom drive other plants extinct by competing with them directly for resources. The view that ecosystems are stable places in which every niche is filled until some disruption occurs has given way to something else. \u201cI think that the natural world out there is more like a swirling and boiling cauldron,\u201d Davis says, where change and challenge are the order of the day. Perhaps the fears about invasive plants are overblown? Not according to Peter Vitousek, an ecologist at Stanford University in California, who says interloping plants more often cause local extinctions by changing something fundamental about the area. \u201cThey don't just compete with or consume native species, they change the rules of the game,\u201d he says, by changing the composition of the soil, the availability of water or the frequency of fire. \u201cIt is often a subtle and long-term phenomenon.\u201d The truly problematic invasives tend to share several characteristics that turn them from, say, a charming ornamental shrub into a rampaging monopolizer of wild land. They reproduce quickly and explosively, either by prodigious production of seeds or by fast-growing rhizomes \u2014 horizontally growing roots that sprout new plants. Often, invasives are plants that in their native regions colonize areas after a fire. They do not attract local insects or diseases. And some, including tree-of-heaven and leafy spurge, exude noxious substances that knock out competing plants. Phragmites  spreads both by seeds and rhizomes to produce thick stands with up to 200 stems per square metre. Its aggressive tactics are the reason for Overstreet's herbicidal attack. He leans back, balancing the weight of the hose. On the weekends, he rides broncos competitively. He is also a veteran of park management, apt to say things like \u201cI did that running from a bear\u201d or \u201cThat was when I was hunting hogs in the Smokies\u201d. Meyerhoeffer pays out more hose so Overstreet can work his way behind a ghostly stand of dead  Phragmites  from last year, which still shelters some persistent shoots. \u201cI'm getting a few back here,\u201d he calls. \u201cI'm leaving the rest for job security.\u201d After a pause, he adds: \u201cThat was a joke.\u201d The strike-team approach is winning converts among managers of public lands. The US Fish and Wildlife Service set up five of its own strike teams in 2003 to attack invasive species within National Wildlife Refuges. These are parcels of land set aside to conserve flora and fauna. Although the word \u2018native\u2019 does not appear in the teams' official remit, it is presupposed, says Michael Lusk, invasive-species coordinator for the refuges. The Forest Service, which manages land for public and commercial use, spends more than any of the other services on managing invasive species; it says it is planning to set up strike teams of its own. \n               Bush administration \n             For its part, the Park Service is charged with preserving places of cultural importance to the United States, such as Alcatraz and the Grand Canyon. So are the reeds around York River being killed for their historical inaccuracy? Rita Beard, who runs the plant management teams, says no. \u201cIt is not just a matter of aesthetics. It is not just a matter of saving the plant communities that have been here historically,\u201d she says. \u201cIt is also about maintaining ecosystems that can withstand the ecological changes that will inevitably occur.\u201d The idea is that an ecosystem with lots of co-evolved species will be more resilient to changes, such as the spread of a disease or a change in climate, than a smaller group of introduced species. The assumption is that aggressive invasive species will reduce the biodiversity in an area and that this will make the area less stable. Ecologists such as Davis are not ready to sign on to this intuitive premise, however. Davis, who sees invasive plants as less of a menace than many, worries that resources are being spent on fighting exotics that could be used for other conservation processes. \u201cMore and more people are now questioning \u2014 with data \u2014 what was originally presented as a kind of simple idea: that invasive species are inevitably a huge threat,\u201d he says. Whether they are or not, culling these plants is not easy. For the mid-Atlantic team, the long, hard hours battling plants can feel a bit sisyphean. \u201cThis is a never-ending process. You can get a handle on it, but the invasives are always creeping in,\u201d admits Jensen. Still, she says, the job is important, and it is clear that it colours her world view. She reaches through some reeds and snaps a bent twig off a tree. \u201cThis is native cherry. We like that.\u201d \n                     Pall hangs over desert's future as alien weeds fuel wildfires \n                   \n                     Invaders leave enemies behind \n                   \n                     Alien versus predator \n                   \n                     US Federal page on invasive species \n                   \n                     National Park Service's Exotic Plant Management Teams \n                   \n                     The Federal Interagency Committee for the Management of Noxious and Exotic Weeds \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},
{"file_id": "438417a", "url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/438417a", "year": 2005, "authors": [{"name": "Erika Check"}], "parsed_as_year": "2006_or_before", "body": "Earlier this month, students from around the world locked horns in competition. Their challenge was to build functioning devices out of biological parts. Erika Check finds out how they got on. Even if you're thinking big, you usually have to start small. Especially, as a group of Swiss students found, when big means counting to infinity. The team was drawing up a blueprint for the world's first counting machine made entirely of biological parts. Although they had their sights on loftier numbers, they opted to go no higher than two. If the plan worked, it would be a proof-of-principle for a much larger tallying device. The group, from the Federal Institute of Technology (ETH) in Zurich, was one of 17 teams unveiling their projects at the first international Intercollegiate Genetically Engineered Machine (iGEM) competition, held at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Cambridge on 5 and 6 November. The event attracted students from all over the world to design and build machines made entirely from biological components such as genes and proteins. They drew up grand designs for bacterial Etch-a-Sketches, photosensitive t-shirts, thermometers and sensors. And if none of the designs succeeded completely, that was more because of the limitations of the nascent science of synthetic biology than any lack of enthusiasm, creativity or hard work. Synthetic biology aims to merge engineering approaches with biology. Researchers working at the most basic level are copying simple biological processes, such as the production of a protein from a gene. They break the process down into its component elements, such as a gene and the pieces of DNA and other molecules that control its activity. They then string these elements together to build a module they know will behave in a particular way \u2014 say, oscillate between producing and not producing a protein, or produce a protein that can switch another module on or off. It is these kinds of components \u2014 oscillators and switches \u2014 that engineers order from suppliers and link together to build more complex electronic circuits and machines. Synthetic biologists are trying to develop a similar armoury of biological components, dubbed BioBricks, that can be inserted into any genetic circuit to carry out a particular function. Scientists at MIT have established a Registry of Standard Biological Parts, a catalogue of BioBricks that theoretically can be ordered and plugged into a cell, just as resistors and transistors can be ordered and plugged into electronic circuitry 1 , 2 , 3 . But it is hard to find scientists who are trained and interested in both biology and engineering to fuel the development of this new science. So, like true engineers, the founding synthetic biologists are trying to build their future colleagues from the ground up. To do so, they have commandeered a time-honoured engineering tradition: the student competition. The iGEM event began life as a project class for MIT students in 2003. Last year, it was thrown open to other US universities, and this year it went international. The organizers hope to attract 30 to 50 teams next year, including some from Asia. \n               Competitive culture \n             Much like the robot competitions that tap into students' desire to build something cool, the iGEM jamborees fire the participants' natural curiosity \u2014 hopefully encouraging biologists to learn something from engineers, and vice versa. \u201cIf you want to make something in this field, you can't just get some glue out and stick two cells together,\u201d says Randy Rettberg of MIT, who organized the competition. \u201cYou have to learn some biology to do it, and it's easy to do that during the competition because you know exactly why you're doing it.\u201d This year, the teams presented an eclectic selection of designs. Students from the University of Cambridge, UK, tried to make a circuit that could control the movement of  Escherichia coli  bacteria. They aimed to engineer the bacteria to contain a switch governing their sensitivity to the sugar maltose. With the switch off, the microbes would ignore the sugar. Tripping the switch would make the bacteria sensitive to the sugar and induce them to move towards it. In the end, the group \u2014 like almost every other entrant \u2014 had trouble completing assembly of its genetic parts in time. Many of the other students also tackled problems related to bacterial communication and motion. The team from Pennsylvania State University designed a bacterial relay race, which it hoped would bring synthetic biology into the realm of sports \u2014 an innovation that won it an award for the Best New Sport at the end of the competition. A team from the University of Oklahoma's Advanced Center for Genome Technology in Norman tried to exploit the sugar arabinose as an engine to drive bacterial motion. Teams from the University of Toronto and the University of California, San Francisco, built concepts for bacterial thermometers; and groups from Harvard, Toronto and Princeton designed bacterial illustrators and Etch-a-Sketches. Detection and sensing were also popular, with groups from Davidson College and MIT focusing in this area. And a lab at the California Institute of Technology tackled a problem raised at last year's event: designing biological memory. Students from the University of Texas, Austin, demonstrated the world's first bacterial photography system. The team engineered a plate of  E. coli  so that they would respond to light and has since used the invention to take numerous photos, including shots of the group's adviser, Andrew Ellington (pictured) 1 . \n               Piece by piece \n             As well as helping students to bridge the divide between disciplines, the competition gave them firsthand experience of life in the lab. All hit snags assembling their parts into coherent devices. It is still difficult to dissect the different genetic components of the circuits, stitch them together and get them to work in live cells. As Emanuel Nazareth from the University of Toronto reported, the students all learned one hard truth: \u201cYou can never allocate enough time for assembly.\u201d This hints at a larger problem in synthetic biology. The field aims to build up a library of parts that can be interchanged in circuits with minimal effort. But that goal is not yet a reality as DNA sequencing and assembling technologies are still a bit too expensive and complex. \u201cWe're not organized at the community level around fabrication,\u201d says MIT's Drew Endy, one of the founders of the field and of the Registry of Standard Biological Parts. These hurdles need to be overcome before biological components will be as easy to deploy as their engineering counterparts. Another learning experience was the reminder that, even stripped down to its basic components, biology can be complex and unpredictable. A team from the University of California, Berkeley, for instance, tried to design an entirely new way for cells to communicate. This is a potentially important because it would enable cells to send and receive information, forming interlocking cell circuits instead of relying on simple gene circuits built in single cells. The team hoped to exploit a natural method used by bacteria to exchange genetic information, known as conjugation. In this, two bacteria connect their respective cell walls together using a structure called a pilus. The group managed to trigger the conjugation response with synthetic circuits. But the bacteria turned out to be so eager to join up that they did so in huge bunches \u2014 and once they did, it was hard to separate them. \u201cThey don't really conjugate one at a time,\u201d said team spokeswoman Melissa Li. \u201cThey can go, but they can't stop.\u201d \n               The living end \n             Scientists in synthetic biology expect to stumble over these unanticipated quirks. But the pioneers admit there is still a basic question that the field hasn't yet answered: will synthetic biology actually work? As Rettberg points out, there are a lot of sceptics. \u201cThere's this big question, which is: can you build simple biological systems out of interchangeable parts and make them work in living cells?\u201d he says. \u201cWe think you can, but there's a lot of people who think the other way and say biology is simply so complex you can't do it.\u201d Given these concerns, it is no surprise that researchers have decided to keep things as simple as possible, hence the ETH team's approach. As Robin K\u00fcnzler said in introducing the project: \u201cIn the beginning we talked about counting to infinity, but we thought maybe we'd start by counting to two.\u201d Despite this narrowed scope, the students faced a formidable challenge. They designed a a series of devices: the first takes in a signal, which is then passed to an event processor. This processor \u2014 a genetic circuit \u2014 splits the signal into two components. A third circuit does the counting and generates a read-out. To design and execute its plan, the Zurich team enlisted student biologists, engineers and computer scientists. Together they successfully designed and tested the event processor. But they hit a snag when building the counter: the company making the genetic sequences was unable to deliver them on time. Other teams encountered similar problems. Researchers in the field hope that the proliferation of suppliers \u2014 including firms starting up in Europe \u2014 will address that problem, if not in time for next year's competition, then for later down the road. But iGEM has been as much of a learning experience for the old hands as for the students. \u201cWe don't know how to engineer biological systems,\u201d says Endy. \u201cYou can't teach something you don't know how to do, so the students are helping us to figure it out.\u201d After all, the field is young, and growing pains are inevitable. Nevertheless, the plan to engineer future synthetic biologists seems to be paying off. Several institutes taking part in iGEM have confirmed that they intend to run classes in the subject as a result. \u201cIt's been a very interesting approach and what it has done is provide very rapid uptake and a very rapid spread of this whole idea,\u201d says Gos Micklem, a geneticist at the University of Cambridge. \u201cThe competition is essentially stimulating every level, from graduate and undergraduate to senior people.\u201d \n                     Synthetic biologists face up to security issues \n                   \n                     Synthetic biology: Starting from scratch \n                   \n                     Futures of artificial life \n                   \n                     iGEM Jamboree \n                   \n                     Drew Endy \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

His creation went on to surpass his prediction that \u201cthe usefulness of the scheme would in turn encourage its increased use\u201d. But in the rush to develop the web as a flexible way to find information, the original concept of users interacting in real time was largely forgotten. Fifteen years later, the web seems to be returning to its roots. For most users, the web in its first decade was like a big online library, where they mainly searched for information. Today it is undergoing a subtle but profound shift, dubbed Web 2.0, to become more of a social web, not unlike Berners-Lee's original vision. Yet scientists are largely being left behind in this second revolution, as they are proving slow to adopt many of the latest technologies that could help them communicate online more rapidly and collaboratively than they do now. \u201cI find it ironic that science is about the adoption, discovery and exploitation of new knowledge and techniques, yet the biggest revolution on the web is passing us by,\u201d says Greg Tyrelle, a bioinformatician at Chang Guan University in Taiwan. He has been experimenting with blog (short for web log) software for five years to interact with a growing audience of his peers and the wider public. The emerging web is largely being shaped by dynamic interactions between users in real time. But many researchers still see publications in the formal scientific literature as \u2018the\u2019 means of scientific communication. Although the traditional published paper is accepted as the undisputed information of record, younger researchers, in particular, are concerned that scientists are missing out on new ways to communicate with each other and the public. They recommend the use of collaborative technologies such as blogs and wikis, websites that any visitor can add to and edit. Supporters say these offer a forum for broader and more timely discussion, to complement the existing system of peer-reviewed journals. This could enhance science communication, both before publication, when generating ideas, and after publication, when discussing results (see  \u2018Open house\u2019 ). Blogs are just one example of new social technologies that are allowing more people to publish more easily and in more diverse ways on the web. By allowing reader feedback and syndication feeds, blogs create an instant online community. \u201cBlogs can offer any kind of content \u2014 from peer-reviewed articles to sheer speculation to rants, and everything in between,\u201d says Amy Gahran, an expert in new media and editor of Contentious.com. \n               The write stuff \n             The best-known wiki is the online encyclopaedia, Wikipedia, which has grown to almost a million entries since its launch in 2001. Scientists at Harvard and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) recently started their own wiki, OpenWetWare, to apply the same approach to sharing lab protocols and data among biology groups worldwide. Outside academia, blogs are taking off in a big way. A study published in October by the Guidewire Group, a research firm in new media, says that 90% of marketing communication companies have either launched, or intend to launch, internal blogs. There are now some 20 million blogs, permeating almost every sector of society. But science is a glaring exception, and today there are still only a few dozen scientific bloggers. Scientists who blog see their activities as a useful adjunct to formal journals, not a replacement. \u201cThe standard scientific paper is irreplaceable as a fixed, archivable document that defines a checkpoint in a body of work, but it's static, it's very limited,\u201d says Paul Myers, a biologist at the University of Minnesota, who blogs at Pharyngula. \u201cPut a description of your paper on a weblog, though, and something very different happens,\u201d says Myers. \u201cPeople who are very far afield from your usual circle start thinking about the subject. They bring up interesting perspectives.\u201d By sharing ideas online, you get feedback and new research ideas, he says. A senior US epidemiologist who blogs once or twice a day under the pseudonym \u2018Revere\u2019 on his public-health blog Effect Measure, has attracted a diverse readership. \u201cAbout 1,500 people visit each day,\u201d he says. \u201cIf someone told me that I could show up at a lecture hall every day and deliver a short opinion, and that 1,500 people would show up to hear me, I'd be pretty satisfied \u2014 1,500 is twice the subscription of many speciality journals.\u201d But for most scientists and academics, blogs and wikis remain unattractive distractions from their real work. Many consider them an online version of coffee-room chatter, background noise that goes against the very ethos of heavily filtered scholarly information. \n               Opinion pieces \n             Scientists who frequent the \u2018blogosphere\u2019 see it differently. The dynamic hierarchy of links and recommendations generated by blogs creates powerful collaborative filtering, they argue. Blogs may create noise, but they are a great way of keeping up with what's hot in your field, says Tyrelle, who blogs at Nodalpoint.org. He believes that the more bloggers there are in a particular community, the more efficient this filtering becomes, so \u2014 counter-intuitively \u2014 reducing information overload. Tyrelle suggests that this is not so different from BioMed Central's Faculty of 1,000, a popular fee-based service that highlights biology papers according to recommendations from a subset of 1,000 scientists. But in the blogosphere, this service is free and could marshall input from a subset of 10,000 scientists or more. Yet even the most web-savvy scientists remain unconvinced that blogs have any useful role in science. \u201cI have my doubts that blogging reduces information overload, but blogging will survive as it appeals to all the exhibitionists,\u201d quips Rolf Apweiler, a bioinformatician at the European Bioinformatics Institute in Hinxton, UK, and head of the UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot protein-sequence database. Others disagree. \u201cScience is too hung up on the notion of \u2018the paper\u2019 as the exclusive means of scientific communication,\u201d says Leigh Dodds, a web expert at the publisher Ingenta. Publication and research assessments are more geared to measuring a researcher's standing than communicating science, he claims. Jennifer Hallinan, a biologist at the University of Queensland, Australia, who runs the blog Cancer Dynamics, agrees with him. The web is providing a hierarchy of sources, she says, including useful blogs and wikis. \u201cEach level of the hierarchy has its own sources of error, its own strengths and weaknesses,\u201d she explains, \u201cbut these are known and can be taken into account when using them.\u201d Blogs associated with traditional journals may help bridge the gap between the literature and blogs, says Glenn McGee, editor-in-chief of  The American Journal of Bioethics . The leading journal in its field, it was the first to create a companion blog, Blog.Bioethics.Net. The bioethics blog allows the journal to respond faster and in different ways to public controversies, says McGee. The blog has high impact, he adds, often influencing reporting on ethical issues by the mainstream media. Print journals cannot keep up with developments in certain fields, adds Gavin Schmidt, a researcher at NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York, who blogs at RealClimate.org with other climate scientists. The blog helps to reduce noise by setting the record straight, says Michael Mann, another RealClimate blogger and director of Pennsylvania State University's Earth System Science Center, citing as an example a recent post on whether hurricanes are linked to global warming (see  http://www.realclimate.org/index.php?p=181 ). McGee and Schmidt have permanent jobs, and both agree that many scientists don't blog because they fear it has a poor image and could damage their careers. Most younger biologists blog anonymously, says Roland Krause, a researcher at the Max Planck Institute for Molecular Genetics in Berlin and a bioinformatics blogger. \u201cMany fear that their superiors consider it a waste of time, or even dangerous,\u201d he says. Schmidt agrees: \u201cUntil blogging is seen as normal, this will continue to be a problem.\u201d Others fear being scooped by rivals. \u201cIn many institutes it's just way too dangerous to discuss work in progress with the people across the floor,\u201d regrets Krause \u2014 let alone on a blog. Such fears are dated, argues Jason Kelly, an MIT graduate student involved in OpenWetWare. The upcoming generation, he says, believes that excessive competition can harm science; they see the benefits of brainstorming their research ideas on blogs as far outweighing the risks. Kelly admits some may regard this view as naive. But Schmidt suggests that once scientists come up with some sort of peer-review mechanism for blogs that increase their credibility, without diminishing their spontaneity, blogs will take off. \n                     Climatologists get real over global warming \n                   \n                     Welcome climate bloggers \n                   \n                     pharyngula.org/index/science \n                   \n                     www.nodalpoint.org \n                   \n                     www.wikipedia.org \n                   \n                     openwetware.mit.edu/wiki/Main_Page \n                   \n                     contentious.com \n                   \n                     effectmeasure.blogspot.com \n                   \n                     blog.bioethics.net \n                   \n                     www.realclimate.org \n                   \n                     cancerdynamics.blogspot.com \n                   \n                     www.facultyof1000.com/start.asp \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Andreas von Bubnoff tracks the demise of the printed page. Vishwas Chavan travels a lot. An informatician based at the National Chemical Laboratory in Pune, India, he collects data on what types of animal live where in India to enter into a biodiversity database. Yet the specimens he hunts for have neither fur nor feathers, but yellowing pages and ageing dustjackets. Much of the information Chavan seeks is in old, out-of-print tomes that are scattered around the world; about 2,500 of the 7,000 books he has unearthed were written in the first half of the nineteenth century. To find them, Chavan has spent years trailing around libraries. He dreams of the day when books such as these are scanned and made available as digital files on the Internet. Chavan and other digitization visionaries paint a future in which books no longer gather dust on shelves, but exist as interconnected nodes in a vast web of stored literature, all accessible at the click of a mouse. So instead of hunting for specific books, scholars could search for specific information, customizing searches to suit their needs. A few years ago, Chavan's dream seemed little more than a castle in the air. True, a number of mostly volunteer-driven or publicly funded projects had been scanning books and making them freely available on the Internet. But most efforts were limited. In December 2004, the Internet search-engine company Google announced plans to change that. It said it would scan millions of books from five major libraries: the university libraries of Oxford, Harvard, Stanford and Michigan, and the New York Public Library. The announcement energized other organizations in the United States and in Europe, which soon unveiled similar plans to scan and catalogue millions of books. The move to digitize books is set to transform the worlds of publishers, librarians, authors, readers and researchers. Obscure specialist titles could find new readerships; librarians and information specialists will have to develop tools to catalogue and navigate this labyrinth of data; and authors and publishers may soon have to start thinking in digital dimensions, just as website designers and writers already do. \n               Bloody revolution \n             But revolutions are rarely bloodless and this one could soon get ugly. In the United States authors and publishers are squaring up against Google for a legal fight over copyright. Opinion is divided over whether the scanning projects being implemented by companies such as Google and Amazon (see graphic opposite) will hand control of the world's literature to private enterprise \u2014 and, if so, what this could mean. And with several independent scanning projects under way, it is still not clear how much of the information will be freely available, or where and how it can all be coordinated and accessed. The idea to digitize books and make them available online has been around since the Internet's inception in the early 1970s. When the US Declaration of Independence was typed in and sent to everyone on a computer network on the night of 4 July 1971, it marked the birth of Project Gutenberg, the first book-digitization venture. Since then, the project's 20,000 volunteers have scanned or typed in about 50,000 out-of-copyright books, says its founder Michael Hart, who works in the basement of his home in Urbana, Illinois, and, like the project's volunteers, for free. Projects such as this are driven by the idealistic desire to make knowledge and literature freely accessible to all, but also by the benefits of having book collections easily searchable. \u201cBeing able to find it online is pretty much the same as having it online,\u201d says David Weinberger of the Berkman Center for Internet and Society at Harvard Law School in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Assets such as searchability have prompted the National Science Foundation (NSF) in Arlington, Virginia, to get involved in an open-access enterprise called the Million Book Project. This is an international scanning effort with many participants, including Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Since the project began in 2002, about 600,000 out-of-copyright books have been scanned, although only about half of them are currently available online (see graphic). The scanning takes place in India and China, with books being shipped there temporarily from libraries around the world. \n               Made to fit \n             Searchability is also the main driving force behind commercial plans to scan books, including texts whose copyright has yet to expire. For example, if their products have been digitized, online booksellers can allow customers to search within books and browse a few pages before deciding to buy. In the United States, with the publisher's permission, Amazon puts searchable digital data from mostly copyrighted books online. Amazon says that several hundred thousand books are currently available for searching. Amazon also offers the option of purchasing e-books and e-documents on its website, which can be viewed after downloading them to a portable reading device (see \u2018 Will flexible screens be the end of paperbacks? \u2019). The company expects these services to drive additional sales. Its \u2018search inside the book\u2019 feature increases sales by 8%, the company says. Scientific publishers, such as the US National Academies Press also see increased print sales when they allow their books to be viewed online. But Google doesn't mention money in its announcement that it plans to make the contents of millions of copyrighted books searchable as part of its Google Book Search project. Its spokesman, Nate Tyler, says Google's motivation is to include literature that is currently only available offline in its mission to make information universally accessible. But the possibility that the company could gain financially from the move has raised hackles among US authors and publishing organizations. In the autumn of this year, the Authors Guild and the Association of American Publishers filed a lawsuit against Google for copyright infringement. They complained that Google hadn't asked them for permission to scan copyrighted books. Google has obtained the go-ahead from publishers to include some copyrighted works as part of its Book Search project, but not all. It argues that it does not need to seek permission for every book, because what it plans to do is permissible according to the \u2018fair use\u2019 exception of US copyright law. This allows copying for uses such as teaching, scholarship or research. Google will, for example, not make the full text available, but only show \u2018snippets\u2019 of text around the search results if a book is still copyrighted. The company says that people are more likely to buy or borrow a book if they can search it this way, adding that the snippets are similar to the card catalogues found in libraries. But Paul Aiken of the Authors Guild in New York City argues that the act of scanning the works is copyright infringement no matter how the texts are used. The outcome of the lawsuit will depend on the courts' decisions over how the concept of fair use applies in the age of digital books and the Internet. Meanwhile, the rest of the scanning world is watching from the sidelines, and being careful to scan only books that are out of copyright, or to obtain the publisher's permission before scanning anything. Google's plan has shaken up the digital-book world in other ways too. For one thing, many believe that its size and resources mean Google can pull of this feat \u2014 so large-scale repositories of digital books seem a more realistic and immediate prospect than ever before. Google has also galvanized its competitors, both public and private (see graphic) to redouble their efforts, and has placed a question mark over the future of libraries and librarians. \u201cI think Google is in a class by itself because of the quantity of money and the level of centralization,\u201d says Daniel Greenstein, librarian of the California Digital Library in Oakland, California. \u201cGoogle has paved the way, created the appetite for this kind of activity, and anxiety on the part of libraries and publishers.\u201d \n               Out with the old \n             But Michael Gorman, president of the American Library Association, says he is not worried that libraries could become obsolete. As well as providing access to books, they serve as a place for people to meet and study, he says. And librarians' expertise in information management will still be needed. \u201cWe are not worried about our own jobs,\u201d agrees Dennis Dillon, associate director of the research services division of the University of Texas libraries at Austin. \u201cThe job is changing, which makes it even more fulfilling than it was before.\u201d But Gorman is worried that over-reliance on digital texts could change the way people read \u2014 and not for the better. He calls it the \u201catomization of knowledge\u201d. Google searches retrieve snippets and Gorman worries that people who confine their reading to these short paragraphs could miss out on the deeper understanding that can be conveyed by longer, narrative prose. Dillon agrees that people use e-books in the same way that they use web pages: dipping in and out of the content. \n               Best of both worlds \n             Having a mix of both e-books and real books could be the answer. A mix would certainly help solve that perennial headache for libraries \u2014 the lack of shelf space and cost of keeping physical books. Ensuring that some libraries always keep a physical copy of a particular work means that they will be available through inter-library loans for readers needing a real book, adds Dillon. Some of them are already dispensing with hard copies. The University of Texas at Austin, for example has about 10,000 copyrighted books and 300,000 out-of-copyright works that are available only as e-books, says Dillon. Another person to be energized, but also alarmed, by Google's move is Brewster Kahle, founder of the Internet Archive, a non-profit organization in San Francisco that archives web pages and other digital files. Although Google has never indicated that it plans to claim ownership over its digitized material or charge for search access, Kahle doesn't want to leave digital books entirely in the hands of private enterprise. That's why, in October, he announced the formation of the Open Content Alliance (OCA). This aims to build a permanent archive of multilingual digitized text and multimedia content, which, as far as possible, will be freely accessible. Like the Million Book Project, the OCA will scan out-of-print books; the first few are already available online. The alliance hopes to rival Google's project in terms of scale; among the groups helping to finance its scanning efforts are Yahoo and Microsoft. Some libraries who were reluctant to join the Million Book Project for logistical reasons have signed up to the OCA. \u201cWe did consider the Million Book Project, but we were hesitant because we wanted to avoid shipping overseas,\u201d says Tom Garnett, assistant director for Digital Libraries and Information Systems at the Smithsonian Institution Libraries in Washington DC, a contributor to the OCA. For taxonomists such as Chavan, the OCA is perhaps the most interesting scanning project so far. Eight museums including the Natural History Museum in London have formed the Biodiversity Heritage Library Project, which will collaborate with the OCA to scan about one million volumes of biodiversity literature, much of it out of copyright. But Matthias Ulmer, a German publisher who helped launch an e-book initiative by the German Publishers and Booksellers Association, thinks that scanning old books is \u201ca complete waste of money\u201d. \u201cScience is moving incredibly fast, even in the field of taxonomy,\u201d says Ulmer. Earlier this year, his association announced an initiative whereby some 100 German publishers are considering digitizing about 100,000 newly published books by 2006. Publishers will take their own digital raw data and place them on a network of their own servers. Scientists and others will then be able to access the books for a fee. With 2005 seeing the birth of so many digitization projects, it might not be long before Chavan can realize his dream of hunting for new specimens from the comfort of his armchair. \n                     France takes on Google in scanning race \n                   \n                     Publishers irritated by Google's digital library \n                   \n                     Science in the web age: Start your engines \n                   \n                     Science in the web age: Joint effort \n                   \n                     Million Book Project \n                   \n                     Open Content Alliance \n                   \n                     Project Gutenberg \n                   \n                     Google BookSearch \n                   \n                     Superstar Reader \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

So when a veteran researcher at the CIA extols the virtues of the latest tools on the Internet, it is worth tapping in to his thoughts. Calvin Andrus, head of the CIA's unit for collaboration technologies, set out his stall in September's  Studies in Intelligence  with a paper entitled \u201cThe wiki and the blog: toward a complex adaptive intelligence community\u201d. Intelligence officers, he argues, should have access both to online (although obviously restricted) blogs on which they can record their experiences and insights, and to wikis \u2014 websites that can be edited by a community. Such tools could transform the responsiveness of the intelligence community, helping isolated officers to comment on each other's ideas and to collate rapidly breaking data and information. This week's News Features look at what wikis, blogs and other technologies may mean for the future of scientific communication beyond the confines of scientific journals. These tools offer fresh opportunities both before publication, when people are debating ideas and hypotheses, and after, when they are finding and discussing published results. They also provide scientists with exciting new possibilities for communicating with policy-makers and the public. Our opening Feature on scientific blogs and wikis finds that scientists are lagging behind other communities, including the commercial sector, in seizing these opportunities. Young scientists are often reluctant to express their thoughts online out of fear that it is somehow inappropriate, or even possibly damaging to their careers. Another worry is that new technologies bring the threat of information overload. Some of the tools we highlight here offer hope on this score, whether through better filtering or improved searching. Academic librarians are keeping a close eye on the development of search engines, such as Google Scholar; some are even blogging about it ( http://acrlblog.org ). But the technological idea that is most likely to land them in hot water is the growth of digital libraries. University libraries that have signed up to digital scanning projects, such as Google Book Search, are finding themselves in the uncomfortable position of leading the revolution. This suggests that they have a vision for their future, something readers who want to discover new works and read books in new ways will welcome. But they may have some explaining to do to publishers, including their own university presses, and to authors who are gearing up for a legal battle with the search giant. A fair number of these possibilities will no doubt fail to bear fruit, either nobly \u2014 by losing out to even better ideas and technologies \u2014 or ignobly, held back by the scientific establishment's cultural resistance. Some, however, will surely thrive. As Andrus puts it: \u201cFor every ninety-nine mediocre ideas, there will likely only be one brilliant idea. The few brilliant ideas, however, are worth the investment of many mediocre (and chaotic) ones...The few brilliant ideas will survive in the market place of ideas.\u201d For online versions of these News Features with active links, please go to  http://www.nature.com/news Reprints and Permissions"},
{"file_id": "438554a", "url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/438554a", "year": 2005, "authors": [{"name": "Jim Giles"}], "parsed_as_year": "2006_or_before", "body": "Google has launched another challenge to commercial search services \u2014 this time aimed at scientists. But is the new engine running as smoothly as its fans hope? Jim Giles investigates. As an undergraduate in India in the mid-1980s, Anurag Acharya had to write letters to scientists when he could not find the papers he wanted. It is a memory that makes the softly spoken computer engineer laugh. Now working at Google, Acharya is creating a search tool that aims to be the first choice for everyone from Indian students to Iranian professors. \u201cI want to make it the one place to go to for scholarly information across all languages and disciplines,\u201d he says. And that ambition, he freely admits, is \u201csimple to state, but not to achieve\u201d. For a member of the public seeking a one-off scholarly article, Google Scholar is ideal. It is free to access, and as easy to use as the main Google search engine (see \u2018 Inside information \u2019). But for academics with access to dedicated library resources, why make the switch? Most scientists rely on tried and trusted favourites, including subject-specific databases such as the US National Institutes of Health's PubMed or the NASA Astrophysics Data System, to find papers. Since its launch last November, Acharya's Scholar engine has delighted and infuriated in equal measure. One librarian has even begun a blog following the search engine's progress. Although there are no detailed studies, many librarians report that faculty members and students are beginning to use the search engine; some suspect that Scholar will replace more established, and more costly, search tools. Figures from academic publishers also suggest that use of Scholar is growing rapidly: it already directs more online traffic to  Nature  websites than any other multidisciplinary science search engine. Thomas Mrsic-Flogel, a neuroscientist at the Max Plank Institute of Neurobiology in Martinsried, Germany, and a regular PubMed user, has started to use Scholar. He says he finds the engine useful when he is not quite sure what he is searching for. Search results include citation links to other articles, so he follows the links until he finds something interesting \u2014 a function that PubMed, which does not track citations, cannot provide. \u201cI follow the citation trail and get to papers I hadn't expected,\u201d says Mrsic-Flogel. \u201cI have found papers that way that I wouldn't have found otherwise.\u201d This citation tracking puts Scholar in direct competition with the fee-based search engines marketed by traditional science publishers. Until Elsevier launched its search engine, Scopus, in 2004, Thomson Scientific's Web of Science had a monopoly on citation tracking. Citation counts allow researchers, institutes and journals to follow the impact of individual articles through time, leading to metrics, such as journal impact factors, that are the bane and blessing of many academic careers. But unlike Scopus and Web of Science, Scholar does more than just search the peer-reviewed literature. Some users like the fact that Scholar searches lots of non-traditional sources, including preprint archives, conference proceedings and institutional repositories, often locating free versions of articles on author websites. This \u2018grey literature\u2019 is growing in importance but remains poorly defined. It is widely assumed that Google considers a source scholarly if it is cited by another scholarly resource \u2014 but as online publishing evolves, so may this definition. Advocates of greater access to the scientific literature hope that Scholar will encourage more researchers to deposit their articles in free online repositories. But how well does Scholar actually work? Librarians who have run systematic searches across several engines, say that Scholar performs well. A study published this year, which looked at more than 100 papers, concludes that Scholar finds similar numbers of citations to its commercial rivals 1 . Yet such results need to be interpreted cautiously, say information scientists. Critics point out that the study did not examine the list of citations to see whether they contained duplicated or erroneous entries. A closer look at Scholar search results suggests that duplication may well be occurring. One of Scholar's harshest critics, P\u00e9ter Jasc\u00f3, an information scientist at the University of Hawaii in Honolulu, has taken the engine on numerous test drives. He has documented the results in unflattering terms on a website run by Thomson Scientific. In one extreme case, Jasc\u00f3 found that the first 100 results from a search for documents on \u2018computers\u2019 and \u2018intractability\u2019 returned 92 slightly different citations of a book entitled  Computers and Intractability  and only 8 other unique results. \n               Cite unseen \n             The source of this problem is the way in which Google adds records to its scholarly index. At Web of Science and Scopus, staff scan in the abstracts and references from print journals and use dedicated electronic feeds supplied by publishers. Scholar, by contrast, uses an automated process. Software robots crawl the web in search of documents that look like scientific papers, and then use algorithms to strip out relevant information such as author and publication date. The process is vastly cheaper and quicker, but it is not yet updated daily and there are no manual checks to delete duplicates or correct misclassified records. Google has deals with several academic publishers that allow it to search the full text of many papers, whereas Web of Science and the others are largely restricted to searching abstracts. But Scholar's index is restricted to online sources \u2014 Web of Science has archives that go back to 1900. And the automated process means Scholar's citation tracking can return odd results. For example, Web of Science finds almost 14,000 citations for a 1988  Science  paper on the polymerase chain reaction 2 , identifying it as the most highly cited paper ever to appear in that journal. Scholar finds just under 3,000. All this suggests that there may be little overlap between the citations in the grey literature found by Scholar, and those extracted from the primary literature \u2014 even when the citation counts match up. For now, librarians are unanimous in their advice: stick to Web of Science or Scopus if you need to do a thorough literature search or an accurate citation count. The engines have impressive coverage and well indexed records with fewer misclassified entries. Librarians also warn that Scholar is still an experimental, or beta, version. Google remains reluctant to reveal details of its search algorithm, or what it indexes, so hopes of using Scholar as a tool for checking on citation counts is a distant prospect, they say. All three search engines will continue to evolve. Scopus and Web of Science plan to add additional resources to their databases, such as institutional repositories, together with new ways for searching those sources. Scopus, for example, is integrated with a chemical database, such that users can go from a literature search to see structural information on molecules of interest. But it is unlikely that these engines will ever mine the grey literature as broadly as Scholar. Elsevier has a separate, free search engine, called Scirus, that searches science web resources, but it doesn't track citations. So where does this leave Acharya's bold goal? Librarians say that Scholar's current high usage rates are likely to reflect searches run by undergraduates, who typically require only a couple of key papers on any one subject, and researchers who want a quick snapshot of an unfamiliar field. Acharya says he intended Scholar to appeal to such users, but also wants to attract academics who need to keep up with the latest papers in their field. As Thomson and Elsevier continue to invest in new services, it will be interesting to see whether Scholar can keep up. \n               Two's company \n             With just two full-time staff working with Acharya, it would seem that Scholar is a low priority for Google. But maybe they could draw on the expertise of outside computer programmers by letting them write software that taps into Scholar's database. It is an approach Google has used before to good effect. If Google allows programmers to do the same with Scholar, it is likely that add-ons would be developed by librarians and academics. So does Scholar plan to open itself to outsiders? Not right now, says Acharya. He remains cagey, but is not ruling it out. \u201cWe may reconsider this decision once the service is closer to how we envisage it.\u201d The Google team may also reconsider if enthusiasm for Scholar continues to grow. Librarians at Virginia Tech in Blacksburg have already created a free software extension, called LibX, for an Internet browser, which allows users to retrieve papers using Scholar with a simple mouse click on highlighted text. LibX will take you directly to your library's resources, if the paper can be found there. And that is the sort of tool both Google and librarians can learn to love. \n                     Enthusiast uses Google to reveal Roman ruins \n                   \n                     Publishers irritated by Google's digital library \n                   \n                     Science searches shift up a gear as Google starts Scholar engine \n                   \n                     Publishers go head-to-head over search tool \n                   \n                     Google Scholar \n                   \n                     Web of Science \n                   \n                     Scopus \n                   \n                     Scirus \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

But is the country ready to capitalize on its investment? Michael Cherry investigates. Sutherland has a reputation as the coldest town in South Africa. Sat on a windswept, barren plateau at an altitude of some 1,600 metres, it is home largely to sheep farmers. But on 10 November, it is set to be the focus of a visit by President Thabo Mbeki, when he inaugurates the largest single optical telescope in the Southern Hemisphere at the town's nearby observatory. When construction began on the $32-million Southern African Large Telescope (SALT) five years ago, it was accompanied by a sense of excitement. \u201cWe are building a gigantic African eye through which we can view the Universe,\u201d Mbeki said at the time. For Sutherland, which is in South Africa's poorest province, the Northern Cape, the prospects seemed good. And the government had high hopes that big science projects such as SALT would inspire a future generation of South African scientists. But even as the telescope saw first light on 1 September, some questions were being raised about South Africa's readiness for the project. \u201cI'm most impressed with the engineering,\u201d says Brian Warner, emeritus astronomer at the University of Cape Town (UCT). \u201cThe embarrassment is that South Africa does not have the capacity to use the observation time allocated to it.\u201d SALT is a collaboration between South Africa, Germany, New Zealand, Poland, Britain and the United States. Having contributed one-third of SALT's overall costs, South Africa has been given a similar proportion of observation time. But astronomy in South Africa \u2014 even more than other scientific disciplines \u2014 is still struggling to escape the confines of its colonial legacy. That legacy has a long history. The plaque outside the South African Astronomical Observatory (SAAO) in Cape Town declares that it was \u201cestablished by the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty in 1820 on the recommendation of the Board of Longitude\u201d. Yet administration of the SAAO, which has run Sutherland's observatory for the past 33 years, was transferred to South Africa as recently as 1971. Since then, just one of its directors has been South African: Richard Woolley, who held the post from its inception until 1976. Even when South Africa's two top jobs in astronomy came up for grabs this year, they were taken by non-nationals. In July, astronomer Phil Charles at the University of Southampton, UK, became the new director of the SAAO and therefore of SALT. And earlier this year, Ren\u00e9e Kraan-Korteweg, a Dutch national, succeeded Warner in the chair at UCT \u2014 the only department in the country dedicated to astronomy. Charles admits that the SAAO is run largely the same way it was a century ago. \u201cIt is outrageous that until recently there has been nothing in place to create an indigenous astronomy community,\u201d he says. The observatory's track record in training graduate students has been particularly dismal, says Clifford Nxomani. For the past three years, Nxomani has run the SALT Science Foundation, an arm of the SAAO that aims to promote astronomy in the wider community. The approach of the astronomers at the observatory, he says, has been one of \u201cfocusing on their work, and regarding everything else, including student training, as an imposition\u201d. Nxomani left the foundation last month to take up a senior post in South Africa's Medical Research Council. \u201cThe ten senior astronomers employed by the SAAO have only five doctoral students between them,\u201d Nxomani notes. \u201cAs a national facility, one of its functions should be to train postgraduate students.\u201d At UCT, it is a similar story. With three academic staff, its astronomy department, has produced just 15 PhDs since its inception in 1972. But Nxomani is optimistic that things will improve. \u201cEverything is changing with the advent of SALT,\u201d he says. \n               Scope for improvement \n             There have been some recent attempts to address the lack of indigenous astronomers. In 2003, the SAAO, under the leadership of astronomer Patricia Whitelock, helped to launch the National Astrophysics and Space Science Programme. Based at UCT, this master's programme enlists the help of 46 scientists nationally who are active in astronomy, cosmology and space science to teach the classes. Students also go on field trips to SALT and other local observatories, before choosing a dissertation topic and supervisor for their thesis. To date, 15 South Africans and 6 students from other African countries have graduated from the course. Another 19 South Africans and 5 students from the rest of Africa are currently enrolled. Peter Dunsby, a cosmologist at UCT who coordinates the programme, hopes that the students from other African countries will return home and form \u201cnodes of expertise across the continent that would be linked through using SALT\u201d. The government's Department of Science and Technology is currently considering a proposal to expand the programme to produce 76 doctoral graduates and fund 30 postdoctoral fellowships over the next five years. By providing training across many astronomy and space-science topics, Dunsby hopes to generate graduates not only for SALT, but also for other fields of space science, such as radio astronomy. That strategy could pay off as South Africa is trying to expand its role in space science. It is currently bidding against China, Australia and Argentina to be the main site of the US$1.2-billion Square Kilometre Array radio telescope, which will be decided in mid-2007. The success of that bid may depend on how SALT is perceived \u2014 especially at home. Local investment in SALT has been justified on several grounds. South Africa has a tradition in optical astronomy that dates back to the early nineteenth century \u2014 the British astronomer John Herschel, for instance, came to Cape Town in the 1830s to map the southern skies, and while there documented the return of comet Halley in 1835. And 60% of SALT's construction and development budget has been spent in South Africa \u2014 resulting in a net inflow of capital \u2014 although only a fraction of this was spent in the poor Northern Cape. Like its sister telescope in Texas (see  \u2018Sharp shooter\u2019 ), SALT will be run more like a space telescope than one based on the ground. Astronomers will submit requests for observations over the Internet, and once these have been prioritized and completed by operations staff at SALT, they will receive their data over the net too. Warner quips that in his retirement he will be able to do his observations in bed. Although this system is more flexible than traditional scheduling, some worry that it might perpetuate astronomy's colonial legacy as it will severely limit the number of scientists visiting the observatory. In addition, four of SALT's team of six dedicated astronomers have so far been appointed, and none of them is South African. \u201cThe problem,\u201d says Nxomani, \u201cis that the job requires experience in working on large telescopes. Only now that we have SALT, can South Africa begin to develop this capacity.\u201d Whitelock confirms that there have been no South African applicants with the necessary experience. Seeing how slowly things change at the top, Nxomani chose to focus his efforts at ground level, working with local schools in Sutherland. He got pupils to take part in educational camps in Cape Town and at SALT. Schools from all over the country are also encouraged to visit both sites. There has been a similar push to improve the skills of teachers, many of whom have attended an 18-month part-time course to upgrade their teaching abilities in maths, science and technology. \n               Teething troubles \n             The problem with astronomy in South Africa, as in so many other areas, originates in the education system. The post-apartheid government has been fairly unsuccessful at improving the maths and science education of black Africans since it took office in 1994. In 2002, for example, the number of black school-leavers who had maths grades good enough to study science at university was the same as it was in 1991, according to a report published last year by the Johannesburg-based Centre for Development and Enterprise. So far, the country as a whole has produced only three black and two mixed race PhD astronomers. But retention rates have been high: four of them are now at the SAAO; the other is at the University of Chicago. Nxomani agrees that the problem starts at grassroots level. He recalls his shock at the low standard of facilities at Sutherland High School, especially as during the apartheid era it was a white school. \u201cIn the Northern Cape, everyone is poor \u2014 whether you are black or white,\u201d he says. Despite these problems, the advent of SALT has given a new lease of life to astronomy in South Africa. \u201cThe future is bright, because if we use our observation time wisely, we should be able to make a significant impact in astrophysics and cosmology,\u201d says Dunsby. \u201cThe challenge is to ensure that sufficient local astronomers are trained to take advantage of this opportunity.\u201d \n                     News in brief \n                   \n                     Southern African Large Telescope \n                   \n                     South African Astronomical Observatory \n                   \n                     South African National Astrophysics and Space Science Programme \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Sound dangerous? Claire Ainsworth discovers that it could be a cure for genetic disease. On 28 November, two patients in an Israeli hospital downed a vanilla-flavoured shake in the hope of curing their cystic fibrosis. The drug in the shake is meant to get their cells to ignore the genetic mutation that makes their lives a misery. Remarkably, if this trial works, the very same drug might be used to help patients with a huge range of genetic diseases. At the moment treatments for cystic fibrosis concentrate on the condition's symptoms, such as lung-clogging mucus, rather than its underlying cause \u2014 a faulty gene. Advocates of gene therapy aim to correct this by delivering working copies of the cystic fibrosis gene to a patient's cells, but results have been mixed so far. The drug in the shakes, PTC124, takes a different approach, concentrating neither on the gene itself nor on the symptoms it causes, but on the process that links the two. It is supposed to work on the system that translates genetic information into proteins, coaxing it into ignoring a specific sort of genetic defect. The drug cannot offer aid to all those with cystic fibrosis, because it is expected to help with only a particular subset of mutations. But if it works for a few people, it should also work against some of the other diseases in which single genes are damaged. It is estimated that one-third of people with an inherited genetic disease have the sort of mutations that PTC124 and similar treatments might get cells to ignore. PTC124 is aimed at thwarting a cellular process called nonsense-mediated decay, or NMD. Research into this phenomenon has taken off only in the past ten years, but it is already offering potential therapies and insight into the mysteries of information processing in the cell 1 . Some of the scientists involved hope that NMD will shed light on classic puzzles, such as why creatures with similar genetic make-up can have different physical characteristics and why our genome has evolved the way it has. In the first step towards producing a protein from a gene, the cell makes a complementary RNA copy of the gene's DNA sequence. This copy, called messenger RNA, is packaged and processed and sent off to the cell's ribosomes \u2014 molecular machines that read RNA and put together proteins according to the instructions contained in the sequence. Each sequential group of three genetic letters, or codons, in the RNA tells the ribosome to add a particular amino acid to the protein that it is constructing. If the gene is damaged in some way, the RNA will be too. If a piece of DNA is missing, some codons will be lost; if it is garbled, the codons will be as well, and the resulting amino-acid chain may not be a properly functioning protein. But not all codons signify an amino acid. Some, the \u2018stop\u2019 codons, mark the end of the gene's protein-coding sequence; they tell the ribosome that the chain of amino acids it has been making should come to a close. Some mutations can cause a stop codon to appear in the middle of a messenger RNA, and it is these mutations that cause the NMD response. In the late 1970s, scientists noticed something odd about a subset of patients with a potentially fatal inherited anaemia called \u03b2-thalassaemia. This disease affects \u03b2-globin, one of the subunits of haemoglobin, which carries oxygen in the blood. In some forms of the disease, patients make faulty \u03b2-globin; in others they don't seem to make the protein at all. Lynne Maquat, then a postdoc at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, was studying the bone marrow of patients that apparently made no \u03b2-globin and found that the messenger RNA for the protein disappeared unusually rapidly from their cells 2 . Maquat and others sequenced these patients' genes and found stop mutations in them. It seemed as if the extra stop codons were triggering a quality-control process that disposed of the faulty messages. But no one could work out how a cell tells the difference between a normal stop codon and one caused by mutation. \n               Don't shoot the messenger \n             A key clue came from a set of patients with a rare form of \u03b2-thalassaemia. These patients made a shortened version of the protein \u2014 the version you would expect to see if the cell was allowed to read the faulty RNA and simply finished the protein when faced by a premature stop codon. The thing these rare cases had in common was that their extra stop codons all lay towards the end of the \u03b2-globin gene. Subsequent work by Maquat, now heading a team at the University of Rochester, New York, and by other groups has shown that the explanation lies in the way that messenger RNA is patched together from its gene 3 . Not all the DNA in a human gene codes for amino acids. The bits of the gene that carry instructions for making the protein are called exons; the intervening bits are called introns. The introns are cut out of the RNA copy of the gene, and the remaining exons are spliced together. These splicing points have marker proteins stuck near them, like Post-it notes (see  graphic ). Researchers think these notes act as signposts, telling the ribosome where it is as it moves along the RNA, explains Elisa Izaurralde, who works on NMD at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory in Heidelberg, Germany. If the first ribosome that encounters the messenger RNA makes it past the final Post-it, the cell will be satisfied that the RNA is up to scratch, and allow other ribosomes to work on it. But if the scouting ribosome finds a stop codon before that point, alarm bells ring and the faulty message gets shredded by NMD. In the rare thalassaemia cases, the RNA survived to produce protein only because the stop codon appeared too late in the sequence to trigger the decay response. The protein fragments that premature stop codons would produce if left to their own devices could do various types of damage; for example, they might stick to other proteins and stop them working properly. NMD gets rid of this problem. In some cases this limits the harm done by mutations with which we are born; in others it may lessen the effects of mutations we later acquire. The development of cancer often involves the appearance of stop codons in genes that would otherwise protect us from the disease, and it may be that the efficiency of a person's NMD response affects their predisposition to cancer. \u201cIt's an attractive speculation, and may well turn out to be true, but it is not yet proved,\u201d says Philip Anderson, a biologist who works on NMD in the  Caenorhabditis elegans  worm at the University of Wisconsin. Still, NMD is a double-edged sword. In \u03b2-thalassaemia, shortened versions of the \u03b2-globin protein really would do damage, and it makes sense to silence the gene through NMD. But shortened versions of the cystic fibrosis protein do not cause disease. \u201cIt's the other side of the coin,\u201d says Andreas Kulozik, a paediatrician at the University of Heidelberg who studies the decay response and its role in blood diseases. \u201cIf these truncated proteins were actually made, they would do some good.\u201d The same is probably true in many other conditions; not all protein fragments are harmful, and some help. \n               Deliberate mistakes \n             Researchers have not yet worked out how to control NMD. But what they can do is smuggle nonsense mutations under NMD's radar, and fool the cell into producing a protein that the decay response would prohibit. In a neat twist, they learned this trick from an antibiotic commonly used to treat the lung infections that plague cystic fibrosis patients. Gentamicin belongs to a family of antibiotics called aminoglycosides that gum up the ribosomes of bacteria, making them prone to misreading messenger RNA. These befuddled ribsosomes will often mistake a stop codon for one specifying a run-of-the-mill amino acid and \u2018read through\u2019 it, adding that amino acid in its place. Researchers wondered whether they could pull off the same trick in human cells and so tiptoe past the NMD machinery. If the ribosomes were to read through instead of stalling, the decay process wouldn't come into play, and nearly normal proteins should be produced. In 1997 a team at the University of Alabama, Birmingham, announced that it had managed to get human cells in culture to read through a faulty cystic fibrosis gene with the aid of gentamicin 4 . Two years later, a team led by Lee Sweeney of the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, showed that the strategy could work in living animals 5 . Studying mice with nonsense mutations in the dystrophin gene, which is mutated in Duchenne muscular dystrophy, Sweeney's team found that those dosed with gentamicin produced full-length dystrophin protein, although much less of it than normal mice do. Movement did less damage to the muscles of treated mice than untreated mice. The papers caught the eye of Eitan Kerem, a cystic fibrosis specialist at the Hadassah University Hospital in Jerusalem. He and his team had noticed that some of their patients with cystic fibrosis improved to an inexplicable extent when given gentamicin to inhale for lung infections, relapsing badly when the drug was withdrawn. \u201cIn some patients, we used to call it a magic drug, because they improved remarkably,\u201d he recalls. \u201cWe always said: there must be something else in this drug.\u201d And they were in a particularly good position to test the idea that gentamicin was suppressing NMD. In most populations, nonsense mutations are the cause of cystic fibrosis in just 2\u20135% of cases. But owing to an ancient genetic accident and centuries of intermarriage, some 60% of Ashkenazi Jews with cystic fibrosis carry a nonsense mutation. Kerem's team gave gentamicin nose drops to 19 cystic fibrosis patients who had stop-codon mutations. The drug restored protein function in the nasal membranes of 90% of them 6 . In itself this did not lead to a clinical improvement, but Kerem was encouraged enough to start planning to administer the drug by inhalation at higher doses than those used to treat infections. At that point he was contacted by Stuart Peltz, founder and chief executive of a biotechnology company called PTC Therapeutics, based in South Plainfield, New Jersey. By looking for small molecules that interfered with ribosomes, Peltz's company had developed a drug that, like gentamicin, encouraged read through of nonsense mutations. At the 2004 North American Cystic Fibrosis conference in Anaheim, California, Peltz revealed unpublished data showing how PTC124 partly restored protein production and normal physiology in a mouse model of cystic fibrosis. The drug has now completed the first phase of safety trials in healthy volunteers, and unlike gentamicin, which can cause kidney failure and deafness, its immediate side effects seem rare and mild. It is also readily absorbed through the gut, making it easy for patients to take, says Peltz. Phase II efficacy trials on adult patients have begun in both the United States and Israel. Cystic fibrosis patients are already trying the drug \u2014 with 24 involved in Kerem's trial \u2014 and patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy are being recruited. The results, due in mid-2006, should show whether PTC124 offers clinical benefits. If it does, the company hopes to try it on other conditions, possibly including cancers in which nonsense mutations play a role. The researchers are aware, however, that letting cells make proteins that NMD would normally prohibit may have long-term risks, and these need to be weighed against the advantages of drug treatment. \u201cI suspect that you don't want to tamper with that too much,\u201d says Kulozik. \u201cBut for certain conditions, tampering a little bit is likely to be beneficial.\u201d The detailed workings of NMD are still unclear. \u201cWe think we know most of the players in the game, but we don't know how they play with each other,\u201d says Matthias Hentze, a biologist at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory. \n               Switched on \n             In the future, researchers hope to control the decay response in a more sophisticated fashion, says Maquat. And it is a reasonable goal. There are signs that the some of the proteins involved in the decay can receive signals from inside or outside the cell, which raises hopes that the system could be turned on and off. Kulozik's team, together with Hentze's, recently discovered at least two distinct switches for the NMD response in mammalian cells 7 . Evidence such as this suggests that NMD is much more than a mere cellular janitor. Researchers know, for example, that NMD proteins are needed for efficient translation of normal messenger RNAs 8 . It could also be involved in controlling gene expression. The ability to splice exons together in different ways lets cells make more than one protein from the same gene. This is a useful way to get the most out of a genome, but it is also a rather messy one \u2014 likely to produce some RNAs with stop codons in them. A nonsense-mediated response reduces the risk that these stop codons will cause harm. And the interplay of NMD and the stop codons introduced by splicing may, in fact, be a way of controlling how and when genes get turned into proteins 9 . \u201cAs time goes on, there are more and more examples of \u2018purposeful\u2019 targets of NMD,\u201d says Anderson, citing his work on  C. elegans . \u201cThese are not errors of gene expression, they are normal aspects of it.\u201d Michael Lynch, a biologist at Indiana University in Bloomington, suggests that NMD may have helped to spread introns through genomes. Using a mathematical model, Lynch discovered that introns are far more evenly spaced in vertebrate genomes than would be expected by chance. Introns in organisms such as yeast and fruitflies, which do not seem to use the Post-it system to trigger NMD, are rarer or more randomly distributed. Lynch speculates that introns and the decay response scratched each other's backs through evolution: NMD meant that errors caused by multiplying introns were minimized, while introns that spaced themselves evenly in genes acted as regular signposts for ribosomes, making NMD work better. \u201cBut who was driving whom is really an open area of research,\u201d he says. Anderson agrees that the decay response is a force to be reckoned with in evolution. By masking the effects of mutations that would otherwise reduce a creature's ability to survive, NMD gives genomes much greater freedom to experiment and evolve. What is more, Anderson's team has shown that differing versions of the same gene behave differently, depending on the presence or absence of NMD machinery 10 . It is this idea that excites medics such as Hentze and Kulozik, who wonder whether differences in NMD could influence how badly people are affected by inherited diseases. As well as saving lives, it seems that understanding NMD could help us to explain some of biology's biggest questions. But researchers still need hard data from molecular biology to make these theories stick. \u201cIt's easy to make these speculations, and very entertaining,\u201d says Anderson. \u201cIt's damned hard to prove, but to me it makes a lot of biological sense.\u201d \n                     Geneticists hail variety show \n                   \n                     Molecular medicine: Lost in translation \n                   \n                     Nature genome gateway \n                   \n                     PTC Therapeutics \n                   \n                     Haddassah Medical Organization \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

But is it too soon to put it to use? Erika Check finds out. Three years ago, a doctor told Debbie Sukin that her son had a rare and serious genetic disease called Angelman's syndrome. The diagnosis meant that her son, then just one year old, would face tremendous physical and mental challenges for the rest of his life. After the diagnosis, Sukin went to see Arthur Beaudet, a leading expert on the syndrome. Beaudet tested Sukin and her husband, and found that neither of them was carrying the genetic fault that had caused her son's disease \u2014 the condition had arisen spontaneously in the unborn child. Because there was no reason to suspect a problem, Sukin did not have any genetic tests performed during her pregnancy. Beaudet, a geneticist at the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, Texas, felt that Sukin's story represented a broader problem in medicine. He could see a widening gap between geneticists' growing understanding of the roots of disease and their inability to detect those diseases in the womb. The main problem is that prenatal tests can only catch genetic problems if doctors know to look for them. For Beaudet, this was simply not good enough. To tackle the problem, Beaudet's lab has developed a way to test for more than 150 chromosomal abnormalities using a single package that costs just under US$2,000 a go. Over the past year, Beaudet has tested the technique in an unpublished clinical trial in 98 women who were at high risk of having babies with genetic problems. He was so convinced by the results that this August his clinic became the first in the world to offer the prenatal test. Beaudet predicts that the test will change the face of medicine. \u201cThis is going to cause a world revolution in prenatal and perinatal care,\u201d he claims. Beaudet's claims are perhaps optimistic \u2014 for now, the test will only be used by women who can already afford genetic screening. Other doctors and scientists agree that the technique has huge potential, but they worry that it is too soon to use it in unborn children. They say it could pick up genetic features that are difficult to interpret, causing extra anxiety for parents-to-be. In some cases, the results mean that additional tests must be done to examine DNA from both parents, which could reveal instances of what geneticists delicately call \u2018non-paternity\u2019. And others fear that the test will give parents more opportunities to terminate fetuses with undesirable traits. Beaudet's technique is the latest development in a long line of tests that examine chromosomes in the fetus. Until recently, doctors could detect only large deletions, copies or rearrangements of chromosomes, such as an extra copy of chromosome 21, which causes Down's syndrome. Now, modern techniques such as fluorescence  in situ  hybridization, or FISH, can pick up much smaller changes. \n               A wider net \n             Beaudet's test has two powerful advantages. It picks up even smaller changes than the FISH test, and unlike FISH it simultaneously screens hundreds of chromosome areas that have been linked to disease. Doctors don't usually check for mutations in all of these areas because most of the mutations are extremely rare accidents that occur during development. Any abnormalities that show up can then be investigated further. \u201cOur system allows you to do every known FISH test in the world at once,\u201d says Beaudet. The new test uses microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization, or array CGH. This is based on the principle that every cell should have two full copies of its DNA \u2014 one from the mother and one from the father. The test scans for regions of fetal DNA that deviate from this pattern because they contain too much or too little DNA. These aberrant patterns correspond to regions of the genome that are either copied or deleted, and could therefore cause disease. Although array CGH is still very new, a few labs in Europe and the United States are already using it in the clinic. But in most instances, they use it only to look for genetic problems in children or adults who have unexplained mental retardation 1 , 2 , 3 . And, unlike Baylor, these labs believe that it is too early to use the test as a prenatal screening tool. Their hesitation stems from a new understanding of human genetic diversity 4 . Researchers are finding that individuals who seem perfectly healthy often carry deletions and duplications of certain genes. The Baylor test looks for mutations across long stretches of DNA, and it could be difficult to predict the consequences of deletions and duplications of these regions in a fetus. \u201cUntil we have a much better understanding of what normal variation is, it is dangerous to launch into clinical testing in the prenatal context,\u201d says Martin Bobrow, a medical geneticist who is working with a group at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute near Cambridge, UK, on developing pre- and postnatal diagnostic tests based on array CGH. Bobrow and others are also concerned about the test's power to uncover ever more detailed information about a developing baby. For instance, an old version of one genetic testing device scanned regions of the Y chromosome that allow a man to make sperm. If found in a fetus, defects in this part of the chromosome might signal that a baby boy is destined to grow into an infertile adult, perhaps leading some parents to think twice about keeping the baby. But, as Bobrow says: \u201cVery few doctors would want to be involved in terminating a pregnancy on the basis of male infertility.\u201d \u201cThe big question is, where are we going to go with all of this?\u201d asks Dorothy Mitchell-Leef, a fertility doctor at Reproductive Biology Associates in Atlanta, Georgia. \u201cI doubt if there's anyone alive today who is a perfect example of a healthy individual and has absolutely no disease.\u201d That makes it difficult to know what genetic changes really mark a fetus as abnormal, she notes. \n               Baby steps \n             Beaudet is aware of these pitfalls. But he argues that genetic counsellors have been dealing with these issues since the 1970s, when prenatal testing began. \u201cWe have always faced findings of uncertain significance in prenatal diagnosis,\u201d he says. He adds that the results of Baylor's year-long preliminary study, described at the American Society of Human Genetics meeting on 26 October in Salt Lake City, Utah, have been reassuring. The test turned up no abnormal findings in the vast majority of pregnancies. In five of the 98 women taking part in the trial, the test uncovered obvious abnormalities \u2014 four were the tell-tale signature of Down's syndrome. In nine other cases, the test detected a genetic hiccough that wasn't known to be associated with any disease, but the variation was also found in one of the baby's healthy parents, so doctors assumed it was not dangerous. Only once did the test turn up a variant that was not associated with disease and was also not found in either of the baby's parents. In future cases, Beaudet says, the group would like to perform a paternity test in these situations, to be sure it is looking at the right parental DNA. He admits that this raises issues of its own. \u201cIt's relatively new territory for prenatal diagnostics to have to look at data from both parents to interpret data on the fetus,\u201d he says. But, he adds, the Baylor group will refine its methods as it learns which DNA variations are harmless to the fetus. And both Beaudet's team and other groups have performed studies to prove that the technology actually detects genetic changes that lead to disease 5 , 6 . Beaudet's prenatal work has followed strict ethical guidelines. But there is a legitimate worry that less scrupulous operators could develop the test to screen for genetic variations associated with desirable traits, such as height or IQ. Although more rigorous than in most other parts of the world, US regulation of genetic tests is still somewhat patchy. So some doctors are calling for self-regulation. Mitchell-Leef believes that medical societies should set policies now on what sorts of conditions should be tested in embryos and fetuses. Beaudet and his group agree that such issues are important. But just as important, they say, are the voices of the pregnant women who have requested the test so far. This January, for instance, Anca Segall, a biologist at San Diego State University, had her unborn child tested. At 44, she was anxious to know upfront if her child had any major problems. \u201cYou really have to think about whether this knowledge is important for you, and it was for us,\u201d Segall says. Her test raised no red flags, and she gave birth this October to a healthy baby girl. Sukin is not sure what she would have done had she found out five years ago that she was carrying a child who might have Angelman's syndrome. But she is sure she would have wanted to know. \u201cWe have a responsibility to share whatever knowledge is available,\u201d Sukin says. \u201cThe majority of people will have a healthy child.

This change will also mean a move towards better science, says Alison Abbott. Every time you reach for an eyedrop or reapply a lip salve, you do so confident that the chemicals they contain are safe to use. But the toxicology tests on which regulators rely to gather this information are stuck in a time warp, and are largely based on wasteful and often poorly predictive animal experiments. Efforts in Europe are about to change this, and the man charged with bringing toxicology into the twenty-first century is a plain-talking German: Thomas Hartung. Although Hartung acknowledges the immense challenges ahead, he sees this as an opportunity for toxicology \u201cto turn itself at last into a respectable science\u201d. Three years ago, when Hartung became director of the European Centre for the Validation of Alternative Methods (ECVAM) in Ispra, Italy, he didn't know that the job was about to shift gear dramatically. ECVAM was set up in 1993 to support European Union policy aimed at reducing the number of animals used in regulatory testing. The centre, which nestles on the sleepy shores of Lake Maggiore in the Italian Alps, originally had ten members of staff and faced an uphill struggle to cut back the millions of animal tests carried out in Europe every year. Then in 2003, two major policy changes were announced from above, increasing the pressure on the centre's labs. ECVAM found itself facing an unexpectedly short deadline for delivering a slew of animal-free methods for testing chemical toxicity. \n               Rule change \n             The first change was to the European Union's Cosmetics Directive, which phases out over ten years the use of animals in cosmetics testing. A short while later, the European Commission proposed its controversial REACH legislation (Registration, Evaluation and Authorization of Chemicals). Europe produces some 30,000 chemicals for which toxicity data have never been registered. REACH aims to make registration mandatory for both future and existing chemicals \u2014 even those that have been on the market for decades. If, as expected, the REACH directive is approved next year, it will come into effect in 2007. Animal-welfare groups fear that this will mean millions more animals will be used in tests to meet the regulatory requirements. And industry claims that the testing process could cost it billions of euros. Almost overnight, industry's interest in cheaper, animal-free testing skyrocketed.  Last month ECVAM was put in charge of developing, with industry and regulatory agencies, the testing strategies for REACH. Now commanding 50 staff, Hartung is rising to the challenge. The toxicity tests that have been used for decades are \u201csimply bad science\u201d, he explains. \u201cWe now have an opportunity to start with a clean slate and develop evidence-based tests that have true predictive value.\u201d Many of the animal tests used today were developed under crisis conditions. The notorious Draize test, which assesses the irritation or damage caused by chemicals simply by putting them into the eyes of rabbits, is a prime example. It was developed by the US Food and Drug Administration in 1944 after reports in the 1930s that some cosmetics were causing permanent eye injuries. One 38-year-old woman had gone blind after dyeing her lashes with Lash-Lure, a product that contained a derivative of coal tar. Then came the calamity of thalidomide, which was given to pregnant women in the late 1950s to control morning sickness, but which caused horrific birth defects. By this time, governments were highly sensitive to public concerns and called on their authorities to develop animal-based tests that would predict all conceivable toxic effects of drugs and chemicals. The principles behind most of those tests remain more or less unchanged today. The battery of tests demanded by European authorities covers all eventualities, from acute effects that are seen shortly after exposure \u2014 such as eye and skin irritation \u2014 to concerns about whether in the longer term a compound might cause cancer, or brain or birth defects. In addition, tests must be carried out to define the risk a chemical might pose to the environment, such as toxicity to fish and other aquatic species. \n               Safety catch \n             Each chemical that goes through the multiple tests required for registration can use up to 5,000 animals \u2014 or 12,000 if the chemical is a pesticide. The cost of doing this for the 30,000 unregistered chemicals so that they comply with REACH has been estimated at between \u20ac5 billion (US$6 billion) and \u20ac10 billion. In the decade since ECVAM was established, the number of animals used in toxicology testing has fallen slightly, although it still hovers at about one million per year. This reduction is a result of the refinement of existing tests, and the introduction of some alternative methods that rely on  in vitro  tests using cell cultures. ECVAM is still pushing on both fronts. For example, the LD 50  acute toxicity test, which involves feeding animals with a chemical to determine the lethal dose, still accounts for one-third of all animal tests worldwide. But the numbers involved have fallen from 150 animals per chemical in the 1970s to just eight animals in 2002. ECVAM believes that it can halve the total number of animals used for regulatory testing within a decade. It has just completed its first large-scale validation study of an  in vitro  cytotoxicity test, which monitors death of cultured cells following short-term exposure to a chemical. Chemicals shown to be harmful in this test would be excluded from any LD 50  animal tests. At least 70% of the chemicals registered in the past two decades fall into this category, says Hartung. And this is just the beginning. \u201cWe've made a lot of progress with the low-hanging fruits, but many of the remaining animal tests \u2014 particularly the tests for toxicity in the long term \u2014 are much more challenging to replace,\u201d says Hartung. \n               Poor prediction \n             This is despite the acknowledged poor quality of most animal tests, which have never undergone the rigours of validation that  in vitro  alternatives now face. Most animal tests over- or underestimate toxicity, or simply don't mirror toxicity in humans very well.  Take the embryotoxicity test in which chemicals are fed to pregnant animals and the fates of their embryos, and the progeny of two subsequent generations, are studied. \u201cAnimal embryotoxicity tests are not reliably predictive for humans,\u201d says Horst Spielmann, a toxicologist at the Federal Institute for Risk Assessment in Berlin. \u201cWhen we find that cortisone is embryotoxic in all species tested except human, what are we supposed to make of them?\u201d  The same goes for cancer. To test a single chemical for its potential to cause cancer takes five years and involves 400 rats, each of which is treated with the maximum tolerated dose. It is dramatically over-predictive: more than 50% of the results are positive, of which 90% are false positives 1 . Yet the number of compounds proved to be carcinogenic to humans is very low \u2014 the International Agency for Research on Cancer in Lyons, France, has identified just 95 proven and 66 probable human carcinogens.  As their experience grows, ECVAM staff are finding out just how complicated it is to develop persuasive alternative tests. A highly strategic approach is required, says Hartung. \u201cIn most cases it is not just a question of replacing one animal test with one  in vitro  test,\u201d he explains. Instead, a number of tests will be required, each of which has been shown to match data on toxicity in humans, assuming such information is available. For example, several  in vitro  alternatives have been developed to replace the Draize test, each with its own advantages and limitations. Among these, some are better at predicting mild irritation than physical damage. Others are more suited to a particular chemical class, such as detergents. \n               Life or death \n             Scientists also cannot assume that  in vitro  alternatives are automatically better, says Spielmann. In 1971, a comparison of animal Draize tests in different labs revealed the test to be hopelessly non-reproducible 2 . But Spielmann's 1995 study of animal-free alternatives to the Draize test showed that they were equally unreliable 3 . Since then the  in vitro  tests have been standardized, and they are intrinsically more reproducible. \u201cAlthough reproducibility and relevance are not the same thing,\u201d Spielmann cautions. Relevance requires a good match between the test results and human data. At an ECVAM workshop in February, 30 industrial scientists met to develop the most effective strategy for using the alternative Draize tests, so that the false negatives and false positives of each test compensate for each other. This strategy is now going through the crucial validation procedure, in which human data, often from occupational health databases, will be used as points of reference (see  \u2018The validation game\u2019 ). ECVAM has so far seen 17 alternative tests through validation \u2014 11 use  in vitro  methods, another six involve refining  in vivo  tests to reduce the number of animals used. An additional 40 or so tests are under peer review, with more to come. Most of the new tests assess acute toxicity, but animal use is highest when testing for the toxic effects of prolonged exposure to chemicals for long-term consequences such as cancer and reproductive toxicity. These costly procedures are harder to mimic  in vitro  and may never be completely replaced. \n               Sounds familial \n             This is why, apart from the \u20ac30 million it uses to support ECVAM annually, the European Commission is funding three multimillion-euro \u2018Integrated Projects\u2019. Under these, dozens of labs will collaborate for five years to tackle more difficult issues, such as allergic reactions or widespread toxicity resulting from chemicals entering the bloodstream.  Scientists know that they are likely to find it hardest to convince regulators about alternative tests for highly emotive issues such as cancer and birth defects. More than half of all animals that will be needed to support REACH legislation are likely to be used in reproductive toxicology testing. The \u20ac9-million Integrated Project called ReProTect has 27 labs dedicated to developing alternatives to these tests. The ReProTect consortium has broken down the human reproductive cycle into smaller elements, from male and female fertility to implantation, to pre- and postnatal development, and is trying to develop a meaningful package of tests 4 .  \u201cQuite correctly everyone feels uneasy about taking risks where stakes are so high and issues so emotive,\u201d says Hartung. \u201cWe all want to be sure that there is real evidence that alternative tests are predictive of human toxicity.\u201d  For example, regulators know the weaknesses of the rat cancer test as well as scientists but, wanting to be safe rather than sorry, they accept it because it is believed to throw up few false negatives. They prefer to let industry prove the innocence of any compound that shows up positive. Any replacement tests will need to reassure both regulators and industry. With so much yet to be achieved, is Europe on target to deliver toxicity tests to meet the new regulations? The Cosmetics Directive phases out animal use in acute toxicity testing in 2009, and in testing for long-term effects in 2013. \u201cWe are on target for the first deadline, but the second deadline may be more difficult,\u201d says Hartung. Fortunately, the 2013 deadline can be renegotiated. The REACH legislation is yet to be finalized, and alternatives to tests that present the highest financial and animal burden, such as reproductive toxicology and carcinogenicity, will not be in place when REACH first becomes law. But the longer-term picture should see a reduction in animal suffering going hand in hand with use of better science. \n                     Thousands of chemicals headed for further testing \n                   \n                     ECVAM \n                   \n                     REACH legislation \n                   \n                     German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

But the tongues are disappearing faster than scientists can document them. Jessica Ebert reports. The tips of dried sage burn in a small cast-iron pan like a row of lit matches. Alex Gwin, an elder of the Hidatsa Native American tribe, carries them from room to room chanting softly in his native tongue. The tiny two-bedroom house on North Dakota's Fort Berthold Reservation fills quickly with the sweet smoke. Gwin extinguishes the sage twigs and sits at the dining-room table across from John Boyle, a linguist at the University of Chicago in Illinois. The burning of sage \u201ccleanses the house so there is room to talk objectively\u201d, explains Gwin. Now he is ready to talk about \u2014 and in \u2014 the language of his ancestors. Hidatsa, like many languages, is on the verge of vanishing and taking with it crucial linguistic and cultural data. As fluent speakers grow older and major languages such as English, Spanish, Arabic and Mandarin Chinese overwhelm small cultures, fewer young people choose to cultivate their native tongue. Only about 75 people speak Hidatsa fluently. Most of them, including Gwin, are over 50. The world contains about 6,900 languages, but linguists estimate that at least half of these will vanish during the next century. Languages are fluid systems, constantly changing and adapting to speakers' needs; death is a natural part of that process. Yet languages are disappearing at an unprecedented rate. Every ten days or so, the last fluent speaker of a language dies, erasing key linguistic information. \u201cLosing languages is bad for science,\u201d says Boyle. Fragments of some are retained in written documents or recordings. But most have never been written down. They vanish without any documentation of their sounds, words or sentence structure. Such information can provide vital clues to understanding how the brain acquires, organizes and processes language. In addition, small and endangered languages often display rare characteristics that help linguists understand the limits and versatility of language. They may harbour knowledge about the natural world and even offer insight into human migrations. \n               Strong language \n             Yet linguists have not always appreciated the importance of rare tongues. In the 1950s and 1960s, the influential linguist Noam Chomsky proposed that the human brain is prewired to learn language 1 . His research prompted others to search for language \u2018universals\u2019 that underpin all tongues and so offer insight into the building blocks of human thought. Some field researchers continued to document the quirky characteristics of little-known languages, which often challenged the language universals. \u201cEssentially, every time we find another language, another universal bites the dust,\u201d says Doug Whalen, a linguist at Haskins Laboratories in New Haven, Connecticut. For example, an important language universal involves the order of words in a sentence. An English sentence such as \u2018the boy hit the ball\u2019 follows a subject\u2013verb\u2013object (SVO) word order. In Hidatsa, the same sentence would read \u2018 maagar\u00edshdawacee ma'\u00faudabi nig\u00edc \u2019, or \u2018the boy the ball hit\u2019 \u2014 a pattern known as SOV. These are the two most common patterns, and certain others were long thought to be impossible. But in the 1980s, linguists studying rare tongues in the Amazon, discovered the object\u2013verb\u2013subject (OVS) word order, which translates literally as \u2018the ball hit the boy\u2019 2 . \u201cIf linguists hadn't noticed those languages,\u201d says David Harrison of Swarthmore College in Pennsylvania, \u201cwe might still have a mistaken idea that OVS is an impossible structure for a language.\u201d By the 1990s, linguists had joined forces to voice their concern about language loss 3 . This spring, the US National Science Foundation and National Endowment for the Humanities established the $4.4-million Documenting Endangered Languages project. Another nonprofit group, the Endangered Language Fund, is supporting Boyle's Hidatsa work. On a September afternoon a few miles east of the North Dakota badlands, Boyle hunches over a notebook and elicits phrases from Gwin. \u201cThe part I like is when John throws crazy sentences at me,\u201d says Gwin, grinning. Gwin calls his language a tool handed down from his grandmother and mother. \u201cNative languages go to where the English language cannot travel,\u201d he says. \u201cThey are the key to talking to the spiritual world.\u201d Hidatsa was not always treated with such reverence; as a girl, Gwin's grandmother, Pearl Burr Young Bear, was placed in a boarding school where English was the only language permitted. Pearl would sneak into the boiler rooms with her friends to practise their Native American languages. On this trip, Boyle is working with Gwin to find out how Hidatsa forms subordinate clauses, which in English often involve words such as \u2018when,\u2019 \u2018if\u2019 and \u2018because\u2019. He is also studying how Hidatsa coordinates nouns, noun phrases and clauses. For the latter, Boyle asks questions such as \u201cHow do you say \u2018the man and the girl sing\u2019?\u201d At one point he accidentally asks, \u201cHow do you say \u2018the man can dance and sing\u2019?\u201d Gwin spoke the sentence in Hidatsa; Boyle, surprised, asked him to repeat it. \u201cI didn't even think about how I was asking it,\u201d says Boyle, but that small slip of the tongue revealed a characteristic of Hidatsa that he didn't know: the use of \u2018can\u2019 as a modal verb. Linguists had documented this in Crow, the language most closely related to Hidatsa, but never in Hidatsa itself. \u201cEliciting artificial sentences tells you a lot about the grammar and structure of the language,\u201d Boyle says. \n               The written word \n             Field linguists often work for years with the goal of producing a dictionary of 10,000 to 15,000 words, a 300- to 400-page grammar describing the language, and a group of texts that show how the language is used. So far, Boyle has a basic Hidatsa dictionary of 4,500 nouns and verbs, a basic grammar book designed for high-school students, and a book of 133 irregular verbs. Native speakers use materials such as these in revitalization programmes; linguists study the details to define the limits of human cognition and language diversity. For instance, many languages use suffixes called illocutionary markers to define the truth value of a statement. Hidatsa and other languages in the Siouan language family stand out by having as many as 18 of these markers. In Hidatsa, for example, the basic sentence \u2018the man kissed the woman\u2019 is built using the words  mac\u00e9e  for man,  wi\u00e1  for woman and  iigirac\u00f3obi  for kiss. But a Hidatsa speaker would have to explain how he or she came upon this information. If the speaker witnessed the event and knows it for a fact, then markers would be added to make the sentence read \u2018 mac\u00e9e\u015d wi\u00e1ha iigirac\u00f3obitooree\u015d \u2019. But if the speaker is telling a traditional story passed down through generations, the final marker would change, making the sentence: \u2018 mac\u00e9e\u015d wi\u00e1ha iigirac\u00f3obiwareec \u2019. Documenting such variability shows the many ways in which people can put words together, explains Alice Harris, a linguist at the State University of New York in Stony Brook. \u201cLanguages are the natural laboratory for linguists,\u201d she says. At Swarthmore College, Harrison has spent years documenting rare languages in Siberia. He discovered that one such language, Tofa, has a single suffix, - sig , that can be added to any noun, changing it into a word that means \u2018smelling of\u2019 or \u2018smelling like\u2019. For instance, the word for reindeer in Tofa is  ivi , so  ivisig  means \u2018smelling like a reindeer\u2019. The smell suffix had never been reported before; why it is important to the Tofa people remains a mystery. But linguists argue that little pieces of information like this are essential for understanding the limits of how the brain organizes language. \u201cIf linguists had only major world languages to study \u2014 say, Japanese, Hindi and Spanish \u2014 we would be severely handicapped in understanding human cognition,\u201d explains Harrison. \u201cLinguists need the oddest, quirkiest and most unusual languages and words to test our theoretical models.\u201d Languages of small cultures can even shed light on human migration. \u201cA language is probably the most important artefact a culture possesses,\u201d says Robert Rankin, a professor emeritus at the University of Kansas. \u201cLanguage can tell us about the things that archaeology cannot.\u201d \n               Speaking volumes \n             For example, the material artefacts of the Wiyot and Yurok tribes of northern California bear little resemblance to those of the Ojibwa, Shawnee and similar tribes of the northeast. But their languages share essential characteristics of grammar and vocabulary. \u201cSo the tribes must have come from the same group at some time in the distant past,\u201d says Rankin. \u201cThis is really important information that archaeology could never have revealed.\u201d Small and endangered languages can also harbour indigenous knowledge, for example about medicinal plants and pesticides. This knowledge represents long-term adaptations to the land, says Harrison, and often cannot be easily transferred into another language. \u201cSmall cultures are a repository of knowledge about nature that is about to be lost,\u201d he says. In Tofa, for instance, each month is named after a hunting or gathering activity. The word for May means \u2018digging  saranki  root month\u2019 because it is when locals collect the bulb of the lily-like  saranki  flower, to be used year-round to treat colds and other illnesses. November is \u2018hunting month\u2019, and July \u2018hay-cutting month\u2019. The knowledge embedded in these words is lost when people begin using a more common language. Tofa children who now speak Russian no longer retain the monthly information, and many elders have also forgotten it. Activists hope that the new push to save endangered languages will make a difference, but it is unclear whether the efforts will stem the rate of language loss. For many, time is running out. Nearly 550 languages have fewer than 100 fluent speakers. And even as Gwin teaches Hidatsa in the schools, most children on the reservation speak English as their first language.

But no Western journal editor seems willing to publish his research. David Cyranoski talks to the neurosurgeon whose global reputation among the ailing hasn't swayed his peers.  Renowned German artist J\u00f6rg Immendorff is used to causing a stir. But when he flew to China this March to receive an unconventional treatment for his neurological disease, he provoked uproar at home. His doctor scolded him for trying a therapy that was unproven. And newspapers warned of the possible rise of medical tourism to China based on false hopes. Immendorff was undeterred. He suffers from ALS, or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, a progressive disease that is slowly breaking down his nerve cells and destroying his muscle control. The condition is incurable, and Immendorff was willing to try nearly anything to alleviate his symptoms. \u201cI see myself as part of an experiment,\u201d he told the German newspapers. The artist's destination was the clinic of Hongyun Huang, a neurosurgeon at Chaoyang Hospital in Beijing. It was Huang who developed the treatment \u2014 and it was Huang who injected two million cells from an aborted fetus into Immendorff's brain. Since 2001, Huang has used cells taken from nasal tissue in fetuses to treat some 600 patients with a number of neurological problems, from spinal injuries to degenerative disorders such as multiple sclerosis and Parkinson's disease. He claims a high success rate, but says he uses the treatment only as a last resort. \u201cMany diseases have no cure,\u201d he says, \u201cand we need to try new methods.\u201d Many of Huang's patients are effusive in their praise for the unconventional therapy. But it remains anathema outside China \u2014 his critics argue that his results are supported by little more than anecdotal evidence. This divide presents something of a dilemma. Medical scientists want to see new treatments put through rigorously controlled studies and are suspicious of claims not backed by scientific evidence. A strong patient following is not enough to demonstrate the efficacy of a novel approach, particularly given that desperate patients are eager to try anything that may help. On the other hand, a physician who believes a treatment is working might resist performing placebo controls as these seem unethical. This can leave patients caught in the middle \u2014 unsure of the science, they will often seek the treatment whether or not the research has been done. Among his patients, Huang has treated about 400 with spinal cord injuries and 100 with ALS. Some who have received the therapy claim that they have improved hand motion and feeling in their fingers. Others report better bowel control and greater ease of breathing. Huang admits that not all of the patients who receive the US$20,000 treatment respond, but he claims that most do. And he says there is no evidence of serious side effects. As a result, his reputation among patients has spread. Some 3,000 Chinese and 1,000 foreigners are now lined up for the fetal-cell injections. \n               On a mission \n             Distracted in an office bustling with assistants, Huang says he is confused over why the Western academic world won't recognize him. He has published nine papers in Chinese journals, including one written in English 1 . But despite his claims of clinical success, Huang says that his latest manuscript has been rejected by several of the top international journals, including  Nature Medicine ,  Science ,  The Lancet ,  The New England Journal of Medicine  and the  BMJ . Huang says his results should be seen as a revolution in clinical treatment, and that rejection is pure discrimination \u2014 a refusal to take a serious look at a new method developed by a researcher in China. \u201cIf this came from England or the United States, it would have already been published,\u201d he says. Many observers disagree with that assessment. They say that the real problem with Huang's work, which he has presented at several international meetings, is the difficulty of measuring his results. For the most part, they are anecdotal. Huang uses videotapes of individual patients and relies on their own assessment of their progress. Such self-assessment is not always consistent. German newspapers reported that Immendorff, for example, felt he could move his hands better after the surgery. But later he said that the treatment hadn't really had any effect. Unlike proposals to use stem cells to treat conditions such as ALS, Huang's cell injections are not intended to replace damaged nerve tissue. Instead he uses olfactory ensheathing cells (OECs) to promote healing through the production of proteins called growth factors that stimulate cells to grow and divide. OECs are believed to be responsible for the olfactory system's unique and still mysterious ability to sprout new connections to the central nervous system throughout a person's lifetime 2 . Studies in animals suggest that OEC transplants can help to repair damaged nerves. This was most dramatically illustrated in 2000, when Almudena Ram\u00f3n-Cueto, a neuroscientist at the Autonomous University of Madrid, used the cells to give paralysed rats the ability to use their legs 3 . Geoffrey Raisman, a neurobiologist at London's National Institute for Medical Research, has seen similar results. Raisman has been working with OECs since the 1980s, and has found that the cells can significantly improve breathing difficulties in rats with spinal injuries 4 , 5  \u2014 in humans, breathing problems can chain patients with spinal damage to a ventilator. \n               All on tape \n             In his office, Huang plays videos of patients taken before and after the OEC transplant. Before, one ALS patient moves forward in a jerky motion and needs a crutch. His speech is limited to unintelligible mumbling. A month after surgery, the same patient gives a clearly enunciated introduction and, after a struggle to stand, moves forward without a crutch and more smoothly than before. Another who couldn't hold a cup for ten years is shown, post-surgery, signing his name with a pen. More quantitatively, Huang scores some patients on tests designed by the American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) and the International Medical Society of Paraplegia. Using the ASIA test, which measures the patient's ability to move, and to feel a light touch and pin pricks, Huang has reported some improvement after the transplant in patients with spinal-cord injury 1 . Since Huang began performing the operations, enthusiastic reports from patients have been broadcast in news reports and Internet discussion groups. Among his champions is Donald Debolt from east central Illinois, who was paralysed in an accident in 1994. He says that he is still improving following his surgery in May 2004. \u201cI was recently able to fasten a button for the first time in 11 years,\u201d Debolt says. Increased muscle development in his arms, back and abdomen are a great help when his wife struggles to get him in and out of his wheelchair, he adds. Laura Jackson, who was paralysed below the neck in a cheerleading accident in May 2003, couldn't breathe on her own for more than five minutes before the surgery. Now she can stay off the ventilator for two hours at a time, and she has regained some trunk movement and sensation in her fingertips. \u201cWas all of it from the therapy? No. Was most of it? Yes,\u201d says Daryl, Laura's father.  But not all patients are satisfied. Francis Catena, a major in the Belgian army until a fall broke his spine, says that despite modest improvements in movement and sensation, his therapy was not worth the hassle or the money. Reached at his home in Thailand, Catena complained of unsanitary hospital conditions in Beijing. He adds that his own doctor raised questions about whether the surgery had been done properly. \u201cI've seen amazing recoveries from Huang's procedure with my own eyes,\u201d Catena says, \u201cbut I expected more.\u201d Patient testimonials and video tapes hold little sway with Huang's research peers. According to Raisman, the fundamental problem with Huang's studies is the lack of proper controls or any independent analysis of the data. \u201cHe needs to carry out studies for a significant length of time before and after the surgery with a degree of independent assessment,\u201d Raisman says. \u201cHis studies are not advancing things.\u201d \n               Hard to measure \n             Martin Schwab, a neuroscientist at the University of Zurich, agrees that lack of careful quantification of the patients leaves evaluation of the procedure reliant on reflex testing and other subjective factors that might produce a placebo effect. \u201cVideotapes and anecdotal evidence are clearly not acceptable as scientific evidence,\u201d he says. More compelling evidence might be possible if Huang used magnetic resonance imaging or electrical recordings of muscle activity to demonstrate changes in neural circuitry, suggests  Nature Medicine 's editor Juan Carlos L\u00f3pez. \u201cThese would be quite convincing data,\u201d he says. Without such studies, it is difficult to know whether the surgery is worth the risks. Although a number of animal studies using OEC to treat spinal-cord injury have been published, work in animal models of ALS or other neurodegenerative diseases has yet to reach this stage. Such work is normally a prerequisite for gauging the safety and efficacy of a treatment in humans. Furthermore, as the fate of the cells once they are injected is not well understood, there is cause to worry about side effects, Schwab notes. \u201cThey could trigger inflammatory processes which, within the intact central nervous system tissue, would have catastrophic consequences,\u201d he says.  Huang counters that he has received approval from his hospital's ethical review board, and he insists that the safety of the procedure has been proven. Although he concedes that there is room for improvement \u2014 so far he has not used tissue-type matching to reduce the chance of the cells being rejected, for instance \u2014 he argues that it is time for action, not more animal studies. Scientific or not, that argument has a strong appeal to patients. \u201cThere are more animal and mouse studies than the world can take. We're ready for the real thing,\u201d says Daryl Jackson. Huang's detractors say that tissue matching, as well as controlled studies, should have been a top priority from the very beginning. They add that this gap between Huang's approach and that of the mainstream biomedical research community will only make it more difficult for him to win general acceptance for his therapy \u2014 and to get published. In the face of the repeated rejections, Huang says he is going to give up trying to convince a Western scientific community that, he is convinced, is prejudiced against him. \u201cIt's their loss. If they believed my results, it could dramatically change clinical practice,\u201d he says. And the patients are lining up whether or not his work is published.

Alison Abbott pays him a visit. Nikos Logothetis could have been a professional musician: as a student, he used to play the piano in Greek bars to earn his tuition fees. And his undergraduate training in mathematics nearly took him into physics. But his bedside reading in those formative years eventually led him to biology, for which neuroscientists can count themselves lucky. Today, Logothetis is at the top of his field. His experimental rigour commands widespread respect, and he is churning out a stream of red-hot papers. More importantly, his meticulous experiments have advanced the brain-imaging technique of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) as a respectable scientific tool. Logothetis seems both pleased and slightly embarrassed by such accolades. During our interview, he frets about seeming conceited as we discuss his achievements. Such are the troubles of a bone fide polymath. Logothetis speaks six languages, and studied music for seven years at the Athens Conservatory in Greece. But music was always a companion, not a profession. His first love was mathematics. Yet after completing a degree in the subject from the University of Athens in 1977, Logothetis was unsure about how to apply his training. First, he toyed with the idea of going into physics, but worried that the certainties of \u2018hard science\u2019 would prove insufficiently challenging. Then, soon after graduating, he fell under the spell of a book on his bedside table:  Chance and Necessity  by Jacques Monod, the French molecular geneticist who shared the 1965 Nobel prize in medicine for his work on the genetic regulation of enzyme synthesis. Logothetis was particularly struck by Monod's chapter on molecular cybernetics, which introduced him to the concept of systems control in biology. \u201cThat chapter was a true revelation for me and decisive in starting my biology studies,\u201d Logothetis says. \n               Universal talent \n             Although Logothetis had previously dismissed biology as being \u201ctoo descriptive and soft\u201d, he immediately embarked on a second undergraduate degree in the subject at the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki. There, he was introduced to neurobiology, which became his professional obsession only at the very end of the course. After rushing through a PhD in neuroscience at the Ludwig\u2013Maximilians University in Munich, Logothetis moved to the United States for 12 years. He first worked at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Cambridge, Massachusetts, as a postdoctoral fellow and later as a research scientist, and then joined the faculty of the Division of Neuroscience at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, Texas. Logothetis's main research focus has always been visual perception \u2014 understanding what goes on in our brains when we perceive and recognize objects. During his early career, Logothetis worked mostly by recording the activity of single neurons using sensitive electrodes; he still uses such techniques for a major part of his work. But during the 1990s, Logothetis became increasingly involved in fMRI. This variant of MRI was then becoming a fashionable research tool, but was also acquiring a degree of notoriety. Some scientists were making exaggerated claims for its ability to locate the precise anatomical locations of particular cognitive processes. Logothetis has no patience with such lack of rigour. He admits to having an \u201cobsessive\u2013compulsive attention to detail\u201d, and soon gained a reputation for careful and elegant fMRI studies. The brain is a very accommodating structure,\u201d he warns. \u201cIt will let you generate a mass of data and interpret them to support your idea.\u201d The key, he says, is strict quality of methodology and keeping the ears resolutely plugged against the siren song of over-interpretation. More fundamentally, Logothetis was frustrated that no one had fully tested the underlying assumption behind fMRI. In most fMRI studies, the main signal recorded, known as BOLD, is a measure of changes in oxygen levels in the brain, caused by variations in blood flow. But until Logothetis entered the fray, nobody had confirmed that these fluctuations actually correlate with neuronal activity. \n               Head hunting \n             In 2001, after painstaking studies in which he compared traditional electrophysiological recordings in anaesthetized monkeys with fMRI scans, Logothetis and his colleagues finally pinned down the neural correlate of the BOLD signal. This turned out to be \u2018local field potentials\u2019 \u2014 not the firing of individual cells, but the more slowly varying electrical activity of groups of cells as they receive and integrate information 1 . The paper was immediately hailed as a  tour de force  of experimental dexterity and data analysis 2 , and in 2003 was the most highly cited study in biology, apart from a handful of genome papers. By the time his landmark paper was published, Logothetis had been back in Europe for several years. In the mid-1990s, he had been in hot demand, and was vigorously pursued by Germany's Max Planck Society, which installed him as director of the Max Planck Institute for Biological Cybernetics in T\u00fcbingen. There, he was given the best available facilities, including high-magnetic-field-strength fMRI machines, and state-of-the-art facilities for caring for experimental primates. But happy as he was to be back in Europe, it wasn't long before Logothetis started to feel oppressed by the isolation of T\u00fcbingen \u2014 a smallish provincial town away from major intellectual centres. Then, in 1997, came an offer to head the prestigious new McGovern Brain Research Institute at MIT, being set up with a donation of around US$350 million from the computer publishing magnate Pat McGovern and his wife Lore Harp McGovern. Extraordinary steps were taken to keep Logothetis in Germany. Hubert Markl, the president of the Max Planck Society at the time, worked hard to find a way to transfer Logothetis's entire department to a larger city. Frankfurt, which boasts a high level of neuroscience research activity, was front runner. \n               Done deal \n             Negotiations opened up, but regional politics blocked the efforts. So Markl vowed instead to bring the mountain to Mohammed. A critical mass of high-level neuroscientists must be attracted to T\u00fcbingen, he declared. Markl aimed to recruit a leading technical expert in brain imaging, who could land T\u00fcbingen in pole position in the race to develop the next generation of fMRI machines. That person was Kamil Ugurbil from the University of Minnesota, who has now been appointed director of the T\u00fcbingen Institute's new department for high-field magnetic resonance. A \u20ac22-million (US$27-million) building is currently being built to accommodate Ugurbil's team and three new fMRI machines. Meanwhile, the German Research Foundation (DFG), Germany's main research granting agency, lobbied for a new neuroscience institute planned by the charitable Hertie Foundation to be established in T\u00fcbingen. The Hertie Institute for Clinical Brain Research opened its new building in May last year. With 150 staff, the institute will work on conditions such as Alzheimer's disease. Safe in the knowledge that a critical mass of neuroscientists are gathering around him, Logothetis is now settled. He has expanded his own department to more than 60 people and his head is a cauldron of plans. He is still not convinced that we understand enough about the neural events underlying fMRI recordings. The local field potentials that correlate with the BOLD signal, for instance, are affected by many different components of the brain's electrical activity. \u201cWe must understand the relation between the fMRI signal and all those components,\u201d says Logothetis. Providing the answers will mean pushing the experimental envelope on all fronts. Logothetis plans to use \u2018tetrodes\u2019 \u2014 electrodes with four contact points \u2014 to follow in more detail what is going on in several neurons simultaneously. Those recordings will then be integrated with studies in neuropharmacology, optical spectroscopy and molecular imaging. Making sense of the resulting data will push even Logothetis's mathematical skills to the limit. Logothetis is also using high-field fMRI machines as spectrometers to record the levels of individual neurotransmitters. And together with chemists at the University of T\u00fcbingen, he is developing a sophisticated MRI contrast agent which changes its magnetic properties when it is exposed to calcium, allowing the calcium to be visualized. This, he hopes, will provide a direct signal for the fluxes of calcium ions that accompany the transmission of neural impulses. \u201cIf the molecular signalling works, then maybe we would not need to know so much about the BOLD signal,\u201d he jokes. Meanwhile, Logothetis's meticulous fMRI studies continue to make waves among neuroscientists. In one recent paper 3 , he argued that the visual cortex does not reorganize itself following damage to the retina. If Logothetis is right, he will have overturned a large body of literature which claims, using recordings from single neurons, that such reorganization does occur. Although the jury is still out, few who are familiar with Logothetis's work would bet against him being right. Unlike many lab chiefs, Logothetis says he will continue to deploy the hands-on skills that made his name. \u201cI prefer to work more like a postdoc than a research director,\u201d he says. \u201cI like to do experiments myself.\u201d Typically, he runs experiments in the mornings and crunches data until the small hours. Then it's time for the maestro to wind down: if he's lucky, he fits in half an hour on his piano before a short night's sleep. \n                     Scans provide picture of brain activity \n                   \n                     Ethicists urge caution over emotive power of brain scans \n                   \n                     Neurophysiological investigation of the basis of the fMRI signal \n                   \n                     Nikos Logothetis \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},
{"file_id": "437804a", "url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/437804a", "year": 2005, "authors": [{"name": "Jane Qiu"}], "parsed_as_year": "2006_or_before", "body": "The Arctic is a unique testing ground for studying how birds navigate long distances. Jane Qiu catches up with an expedition to unravel the signals that help birds on their migrations. The captain of an ice-breaker has few problems navigating during the polar summer. The 24-hour sunlight provides constant illumination of the surroundings. When storms whip up, the captain can turn to a suite of global-positioning devices, which pinpoint the ship's location to a matter of metres. Yet all this electronic sophistication is put to shame by the migratory birds wheeling overhead, which navigate thousands of kilometres using nothing more than what is in their heads. This summer, the ice-breaker  Oden  tracked migrating birds as they left the Arctic through the Bering Strait, the narrow waterway between Alaska and Siberia. More than 50 polar scientists had gathered as part of a wide-ranging project called Beringia 2005. Among them were Thomas Alerstam of Lund University in Sweden and his research team. They were there to shed light on one of ornithology's greatest mysteries: how do birds navigate during their annual migration? Thousands of birds gather from all over the world to breed and rear their young in the summer Arctic, where the landscape is temporarily rich with thousands of plants and insect species. Birds such as the Arctic tern ( Sterna paradisaea ) fly 18,000 kilometres across featureless oceans to get there, and navigational skills are crucial. Drifting off course could cause the birds to miss the land and succumb to exhaustion. When summer wanes, they must once again find their way back, heading as far as South America, New Zealand or even the Antarctic. The precise nature of their navigational gift has fascinated scientists for hundreds of years 1 . In the early nineteenth century, studies in basic magnetism, along with expeditions to the North and South Poles, inspired scientists to propose that birds are guided by an inner magnetic sense, like a compass needle. Nearly two centuries later, this seemingly bizarre idea was supported by the discovery of magnetite, or iron oxide, in the brains of some bird species. The magnetite is thought to act as a tiny compass 2 . \n               Clued up \n             But birds use a number of different navigational cues. As well as Earth's magnetic field, these include the landscape, and the positions of the Sun and the stars. In controlled laboratory experiments, scientists have demonstrated that a number of bird species can use these cues and others, separately or in combination. However, no one knows how the birds put them together to find their way. \u201cIt is a different matter in the wild,\u201d says Alerstam. \u201cWhich cues do they use then? Are some cues more important than others? We have no answer to these questions yet.\u201d To navigate, birds need to know in which direction they are heading. A magnetic compass sense can tell them; so can the position of the Sun, as long as they know the time of day. But direction alone cannot keep a bird on course, says S\u00f6nke Johnsen, a biologist at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina. \u201cA compass sense is often not enough to guide an animal to a specific destination or to steer reliably along a long and complex migratory route,\u201d he says. Birds must also be able to determine their position relative to a destination and continuously recalculate their heading. Just three parameters of Earth's magnetic field may be enough to guide the birds on their journeys, researchers think. The first, the strength of the magnetic field, varies with latitude. The second, dip angle, is the angle between the magnetic field line at a given location and Earth's surface; this angle is 0\u00b0 at the equator and 90\u00b0 at the north and south magnetic poles. The third parameter, magnetic variation, marks the difference between directions towards the geographic and magnetic poles, and varies depending on location on Earth's surface. Exactly how birds derive their direction and position from this information isn't entirely clear. The problem is further complicated at high latitudes, where Earth's magnetic field lines converge. \u201cAs the dip angle approaches 90\u00b0, the magnetic field lines go almost straight into the Earth, leaving very little of the horizontal information that is necessary for orientation,\u201d says Alerstam. As birds get closer to the north magnetic pole, which lies 1,400 km from its geographic counterpart, magnetic variation increases. And magnetic minerals in the Arctic Ocean or the tundra can give rise to anomalies in the magnetic field in the region. Daily variations in the magnetic field are also more erratic, because of the way that solar radiation affects the magnetic poles. The 24-hour daylight of the polar summer means that the birds cannot even use the stars or daily rhythms of the Sun as a pointer. But the very complexity of the Arctic makes it an attractive location for testing birds' navigational strategies. \u201cThe only way to find out how birds cope in such complicated geomagnetic regions is to go out there and take a look,\u201d says Alerstam. \n               Bearing up \n             Two months into this summer's expedition, Alerstam wasn't certain that his team would find any answers. At 4:00 a.m. on 14 August,  Oden  was steering slowly through thick ice towards Wrangel Island off Siberia. The ship swayed heavily from side to side and the ice was so dense that it had to reverse slightly to gain enough momentum to advance another 50 metres. \u201cWe can only hope that the equipment will survive such harsh treatment,\u201d Alerstam wrote in his notes. After a few hours, the ice thinned and  Oden  started to sail smoothly. In the ship's operation room, Alerstam was absorbed in watching hundreds of echoes appearing on the radar screens. Conditions were perfect after several days of rain, and  Oden 's radar equipment had picked up echoes of large flocks of migratory birds heading out of the Arctic. Most of them were travelling east and south at high altitudes, 2,000 to 3,000 metres up. One echo even came from an altitude of 4,800 metres \u2014 a record height for the trip. Radar tracking allows scientists to follow individual birds or flocks for up to 15 kilometres. By the end of the trip, Alerstam and his team had recorded nearly 600 such tracks. Based on these echo recordings, they calculated flock densities as well as the speed, direction and altitude of the migration. The motion of helium-filled balloons released from  Oden  was also tracked, and this information on wind patterns allowed the team to calculate the headings and trajectories of the birds themselves. The different cues that birds might use for navigation generate very different trajectories, particularly at high latitudes. So researchers can calculate specific paths for each cue and compare them with where the flocks actually go, revealing which cues are most important to the birds. Alerstam calculated several possible routes for the species they wanted to track. He predicted that, if the birds navigate mainly using a magnetic compass, they would fly northeast from the expedition site towards high Arctic Canada. Predicting paths for birds that are using a Sun compass is more complicated because the directional information depends on the bird's sense of time. At high latitudes, the distances between longitudes are so small that migratory birds may fly across three or four lines of longitude in a single day. Either the birds' internal clocks adjust to the local time as they go, or they remain constantly jet-lagged. Alerstam calculated that birds following the Sun and not adjusting to local time would curve to the southeast, passing through the Bering Strait and western and northern Alaska. Birds that fly using a Sun compass and correct it for the shifting time zones might be expected to fly a route somewhere between the Bering Strait and the magnetic route. In 1994, Alerstam went on an expedition to the Russian Arctic and discovered that most birds in western Siberia flew towards the east at the end of the breeding season, a puzzling observation as the birds' destination was south. It turned out that their migratory paths were most consistent with a Sun-compass route without time correction, and Alerstam inferred that the birds were using the Sun to navigate while experiencing constant jet lag 3 . So on the  Oden  trip, says Alerstam, \u201cwe expected to see massive migrant flow \u2014 mostly on southeast courses \u2014 over the Bering Strait, western and northern Alaska, and northwesternmost Canada.\u201d That is exactly what his team found (see map, overleaf). \n               Coarse corrections \n             One curious feature of the strategy that uses the Sun without time correction is that it gives trajectories that approximate a \u2018great circle\u2019 route. A great circle is the shortest arc connecting two points on the globe. Following a great circle route is quicker, but requires the traveller to change compass course continuously; navigating with a constant magnetic compass course is easier, but results in much longer routes. Pilots and sailors regularly follow great circle routes with the help of complex geometric computing. And it seems that birds have found a way to do this too. \u201cIt makes sense as this saves energy, which is important given that they have to fly thousands of miles,\u201d says Alerstam. How have birds learned this navigational trick? For most animals that travel in east\u2013west directions, changes in the time of sunset or sunrise reset their internal clock \u2014 but this process takes a few days. If it also takes days in Arctic birds, then as they migrate long distances towards the east or west they will be constantly out of phase with the local time, and misread the Sun as a result. Not knowing that they are out of sync, they will end up flying along the energy-saving great circle routes. \u201cMaybe it is a lucky coincidence,\u201d says Alerstam. Another possibility is that the birds can correct for the changing time zones, but actively suppress this adjustment. According to the late Eberhard Gwinner of the Max Planck Institute for Ornithology in Andechs, Germany, migratory birds in the Arctic should be able to adjust their internal clock very swiftly 4 . In the Arctic summer, some birds have low levels of melatonin, a hormone that is usually controlled by the daily cycle between light and dark. Lower melatonin levels suggest that the birds have a weaker clock in the polar summer, which may allow them to adapt quickly to changing environmental conditions, but could also be readily suppressed. Of course birds must have some sense of time to find their direction, even if it is then slightly offset by jet lag. \u201cThere are other natural cues the birds rely on, such as the colour and polarization patterns of light,\u201d says Michaela Hau of Princeton University in New Jersey. Once the birds find their way to lower latitudes, points out Alerstam, the conditions for navigation become much less extreme. He suggests that they may then use different strategies to find their way. \n               Are we nearly there yet? \n             One thing is clear from the past 30 years of research: birds use a delicate combination of cues to create a sophisticated backup system. If one cue is taken away from them, they will use the next down the line. And the cues that birds use and the way they navigate depends crucially on geographic location and weather conditions. \u201cAt the end of the day, both fieldwork and laboratory experiments are necessary for understanding bird orientation. And they should always go hand in hand,\u201d says Martin Wikelski of Princeton University. \u201cExpeditions such as Alerstam's represent one of those points where we are pushing things from a steady state to the next level,\u201d he says. In another such push, Wikelski is working on an international initiative to study small-animal migration around the world. This project will use unmanned aerial vehicles or even a specialized radio receiver in low Earth orbit. Either approach would allow researchers to map the global migratory patterns of birds and insects carrying embedded miniature radio transmitters. \u201cTo track individual birds around the globe will completely revolutionize avian research,\u201d says Alerstam. Such studies will not only shed light on bird navigation, but also have implications for preventing or containing animal-based epidemics such as avian influenza. The study of migrating birds may thus have a bearing on much wider questions than just how and why they fly. \n                     Homing pigeons reveal true magnetism \n                   \n                     Sleep-deprived sparrows stay sharp \n                   \n                     Tagged geese text home \n                   \n                     Birds fly best on a full tank \n                   \n                     Flight on time \n                   \n                     Alerstam's lab page \n                   \n                     Swedish Polar Research Secretariat \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Emma Marris visits a testing ground for future conservation strategies. On the savannah of central Brazil, it is dry and hot, but far from lifeless. Iridescent blue butterflies the size of handkerchiefs fly by. Leafcutter ants march in line across the dusty red soil, holding snippets of foliage like sails. The silica-filled leaves of shoulder-high shrubs clatter like snare drums in the breeze. Yet just over the next rise lies another landscape: the unvarying green of a soya field. In a dramatic change in land use, this vast inland region of savannah and dry woodland, known as the Cerrado, is rapidly being replaced with crops and pasture. Over the past 35 years, more than half of the Cerrado's original expanse of two million square kilometres has been taken for agriculture. It is now among the world's top regions for the production of beef and soya. Agriculture is one of the largest and most dynamic parts of Brazil's economy, and those working to save the Cerrado are unlikely to be able to slow or stop the sector's expansion. Just 2.2% of the Cerrado is protected, and it is losing ground faster than the Amazon rainforest to the north. At the current rate of loss, the ecosystem could be gone by 2030, according to estimates by Conservation International in Washington DC (see map). Like the Amazon basin, the Cerrado is a great source of biodiversity. Its 137 threatened species include the maned wolf ( Chrysocyon brachyurus ), a striking, long-legged beast that resembles a fox on stilts. And the sparse, scrubby vegetation features more than 4,000 species that grow only here. Yet the Cerrado has little of the global recognition or celebrity advocacy that has helped advance the cause of conservation in the Amazon. If some of the savannah is to be saved, conservationists have realized, they will have to stress its importance to Brazil's economic well-being. This may also mean working hand-in-hand with those who are developing the Cerrado for agriculture \u2014 risking accusations of \u2018greenwash\u2019 from purists in the environmental movement. Given that similar pressures face other neglected ecosystems, the Cerrado could become an important barometer of the prospects for conservation worldwide. \n               In from the cold \n             The Cerrado might still have been an overlooked ecosystem had it not been for a project to document the workings of the world's tropical savannahs, set up in the mid-1980s by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization. Under that project, a group of students at the University of Brasilia were given their start in ecology. \u201cSeven of us went abroad to get our PhDs, and we formed a little revolution,\u201d says Carlos Klink, who is now a professor at the university. Today, they are in the vanguard of efforts to characterize and preserve what remains of the Cerrado. At his field site, 35 kilometres south of Brasilia, Klink shows off the pits he has dug to study the Cerrado's underground life. Below the surface, huge root systems stretch to suck up water and nutrients from the poor soil. Klink points to fields that he has burned off after various intervals to see how the natural fire cycle affects the pattern of vegetation. \u201cThis is a pequi,\u201d he says, grasping a skinny tree with wilted-looking leaves. Its fruits have a yellow pulp and taste divine. \u201cIt's pollinated by bats,\u201d he adds. The pequi tree ( Caryocar brasiliense ), at three metres, is the tallest thing in this bit of the Cerrado \u2014 an untidy patchwork of tall floppy grasses, greyish bromeliads and nondescript scrubs with puckered leaves. It's certainly not the archetype of scenic beauty. \u201cEven scientists in Brazil tend to think that this is a secondary kind of ecosystem,\u201d says Klink. \u201cThat's a pity. I find it a lovely place.\u201d It is also a fragile ecosystem, which can be severely damaged by fires that start on neighbouring pasture. The savannah depends on natural fires, started by lightning, to clear out dead grasses and pop open seed-pods. \u201cBut you must have the right amount of fire,\u201d says Roberto Cavalcanti, another University of Brasilia ecologist, who is currently working with Conservation International in Washington DC. Alas, the oily molasses grass ( Melinis minutiflora ), which was once widely planted for pasture and has since invaded the fringes of the wild Cerrado, can cause fires to rage so hotly that they burn through the tough fire-adapted bark of native woody plants. Fires are also set deliberately to clear land for pasture. But the soil is so poor that, without extensive use of fertilizer, the imported grasses tend to fail after two or three years of busy grazing, leaving just dust, rock and carbuncular termite mounds several feet high. \n               Price of progress \n             For hundreds of years, the Cerrado's inaccessibility and poor soil saved it from large-scale exploitation. But as Brazil embraced the Green Revolution in the 1970s, new soya varieties and fertilizers made the region a viable agricultural prospect. By then, the gleaming new administrative capital of Brasilia had been built in the midst of the area, bringing with it roads and people, eager for fresh economic opportunities. For a while, clearing of savannah was encouraged by the government, because it eased development pressure on the Amazon. Today, there is official recognition of the need for conservation in the Cerrado. But still the odds remain stacked in favour of the rainforest. Brazil's Forest Code requires owners of Amazon land to set aside 80% as a reserve. In the Cerrado, the requirement is just 20%, and enforcement is poor. Ruth DeFries, a geographer at the University of Maryland in College Park, can testify to the problems. She is keeping track of changes in land use in Brazil using data from the Terra and Aqua satellites. But it is not easy because the Cerrado and pasture look very similar from low orbit. So she travels periodically to the region of Mato Grosso, where the Cerrado meets the rainforest, to verify her satellite observations. In Mato Grosso alone, she has seen some one million hectares of Cerrado and forest cleared for cropland between 2001 and 2004. \u201cI have seen an awful lot of clearing,\u201d she says. Slowing this destruction will mean working with the government and agricultural interests, say ecologists. And the window of opportunity may be small. \u201cThese are the crucial five years,\u201d says Cavalcanti. \u201cRemember, conservation is cheaper than restoration.\u201d John Buchanan, director of agriculture and fisheries at Conservation International's Center for Environmental Leadership in Business in Washington DC, is grasping the opportunity in partnership with Bunge, the largest producer of soya beans in Brazil, headquartered in White Plains, New York. In a pilot project, Buchanan has worked with Bunge employees and local farmers to set up the legally required reserves so that a contiguous corridor of Cerrado snakes across the landscape. \u201cWe really have no choice but to work with agribusiness,\u201d says Buchanan. \u201cIt's not an either/or situation.\u201d \n               Trading places \n             In July, when the Society for Conservation Biology held its annual meeting in Brasilia, such projects came under scrutiny in a session on assessing trade-offs between human and ecological needs. Some representatives from the state-run Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation, known as EMBRAPA, attended warily, worried that their role in bringing about the large-scale development of the Cerrado would see them cast as villains. Geraldo Martha J\u00fanior, an agronomist at EMBRAPA based in Brasilia, gave one of the most provocative presentations, arguing that the best way to avoid unnecessary encroachment into the Cerrado is to ensure that introduced pasture grasses are adequately fertilized. He also considered the option of pasturing cattle on natural vegetation. But his presentation showed that it wasn't economically viable: the cows just wouldn't get fat enough to turn a profit. By the end of the session, the EMBRAPA scientists seemed less cautious \u2014 and by and large, their presentations were received graciously by the assembled conservation biologists. In part, that reflects a sense of relief that research into protecting the Cerrado is now under way. Until recently, Brazil's savannah was a minority scientific interest, and there was no organized effort to save it from the plough. The welcome extended to Martha J\u00fanior and his colleagues is also indicative of a growing realization among conservationists that their strategies must accommodate economic development (see  Nature   437 , 614\u2013616; 2005). To this end, ecologists working in the Cerrado are now stressing the \u2018ecosystem services\u2019 it provides \u2014 many of which have a tangible economic value. Some are investigating the role of the native landscape as a carbon sink, as a centre of genetic diversity for the crop cassava, or as a protector of Brazil's soil and water. Klink is working to map the region in terms of carbon storage and movement. Native pasture, with its huge root systems, stores more carbon than pasture and crops. He and his team have also quantified the amount of water held in different ecosystems. They found that in planted pasture, evaporation equalled rainfall, whereas in the Cerrado it was about 20% less, keeping more water available in the ground. Jo\u00e3o Campari, director of the central savannah programme at the Nature Conservancy in Brazil, has taken this approach a step further and proposed a Cerrado Grassland Exchange \u2014 a financial instrument that would attach monetary, tradable value to the areas that are protected by Brazil's Forest Code. DeFries is saddened by the thought of more savannah being cleared for the inevitable expansion of agriculture. But pragmatism has to be the order of the day, she says. \u201cAgricultural production and the revenue that it provides is important for the development of Brazil. I don't think it's effective to take the viewpoint that the entire Cerrado be conserved,\u201d says DeFries. \u201cThat's not realistic or desirable.\u201d \n                     Conservation: Dollars and sense \n                   \n                     Brazilian savannah 'will disappear by 2030' \n                   \n                     Cerrado biodiversity hotspot \n                   \n                     EMBRAPA \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

They hope some day to probe for life beneath the surface of Mars. Jenny Hogan investigates. \u201cOkay, we're at the surface,\u201d a voice calls across the tent. \u201cCan someone hit the \u2018yes\u2019 button?\u201d In the centre of a makeshift laboratory, sweltering beneath the Spanish sun, people cluster anxiously around a robotic drill. Its silver arm draws up from the deep hole it has made in the dirt. Hitting the \u2018yes\u2019 button will trigger the drill to release its cargo, and reveal whether it has managed to bore material from metres beneath our feet. \u201cHave we got a core?\u201d asks Howard Cannon, an engineer from NASA's Ames Research Center in California. Peering into the end of the instrument, he spots a plug of red mud, some 7 centimetres long. This is good news. The drill is a prototype for an instrument that might one day be sent to Mars. It's Cannon's job to see if he can get the drill to work here on Earth. A team of mission scientists is pretending that this drill, and the precious core it carries, is located on Mars. The drill is equipped with scientific instruments to search for signs of life in the dirt. So, for the team, extracting this chunk of red earth could be a step towards finding out whether life lurks beneath the sterile surface of Mars. The drilling technologies being tested here, or others like it, may one day travel to the red planet aboard European Space Agency or NASA missions (see  First drill on Mars ). Although the martian surface is too cold, dry and drenched in radiation for anything to survive above ground, past life forms could have taken refuge underground, some scientists think. Data from the swarm of spacecraft currently roaming over and orbiting Mars have identified some possible spots where surface life may once have thrived. \u201cWe do our best to pick the sweet cherries, the prime candidates for life,\u201d says James Dohm, a planetary geologist at the University of Arizona, Tucson. \u201cBut eventually we have to have subsurface analysis.\u201d The Spanish project is headed by planetary scientist Carol Stoker of the Ames Research Center, a veteran of previous Mars missions, and focuses on the unusual geochemical environment of Spain's Rio Tinto region. To a visitor, the landscape looks little like barren Mars. The drill sits at the edge of an old mining pit that is surrounded by pine trees. A lake of red-hued water lies below, and groves of orange trees stretch out in the distance. Local authorities recognize the beauty of the place; they erected a sturdy stone picnic bench for tourists \u2014 right on one of the team's preferred drilling sites. \n               Hostile habitat \n             But it's underground, in the rocks from which the scenery is carved, that the Rio Tinto region may be most like Mars. A hardy microbial world inhabits the acidic waters of the Tinto river. This is what astrobiologists dream of finding in the subsurface of other worlds. Microbiologist Ricardo Amils, of the Autonomous University of Madrid, a member of the science team, has studied the area for years and once gave Stoker an enthusiastic tour. Her imagination was fired by the idea of an underground ecosystem. \u201cI'm not sure it struck him as a really good planetary analogue, but it did me,\u201d she says. Thus, the Mars Analog Research and Technology Experiment (MARTE) was born. In 2004, the project's second year, it got a huge boost from data flowing back from NASA's Mars Exploration Rovers, Spirit and Opportunity. The rovers identified minerals on the surface of Mars, including the sulphate jarosite, which suggested that, when it existed, martian water was salty and acidic 1 . These are just the kind of conditions found at Rio Tinto 2 . Planetary scientists, with their study subjects so far out of reach, have long scoured Earth for otherworldly environments. For years, Mars researchers have been studying the life forms that eke out an existence in the Atacama Desert of Chile or in the cold, parched Dry Valleys of Antarctica. One group is exploring ice-bound communities of bacteria in a frozen volcano on Svalbard, the arctic archipelago off the coast of Norway. Some, in an effort to understand the martian atmosphere, are studying the dust devils whipped up in Nevada's Eldorado Valley. Others put rovers through their paces in rock-strewn deserts. Michael Meyer, NASA's lead scientist for Mars, says it is important to study as many of these places as possible. \u201cWe don't want to get too far ahead of ourselves in predicting what Mars is like and expend all our energy on one site,\u201d he says. But Rio Tinto, he says, is a good place to include. The Tinto river gets its unique chemistry from the Iberian Pyrite Belt, a vast deposit of sulphide minerals tens of kilometres wide that runs for about 250 kilometres through southern Spain and Portugal. These minerals were laid down when the region was under water; at the site of a hydrothermal vent, deep-seated volcanism forced hot water, rich with dissolved chemicals, through cracks in Earth's crust. \n               Bottom dwellers \n             Although the Tinto river is naturally acidic and loaded with heavy metals, mining has exacerbated these characteristics 3 . For 5,000 years, locals mined the deposit for heavy metals, notably copper. Around Nerva, the Spanish town where the MARTE team is based, the hills are scarred by open pits and abandoned mining equipment. The acidity, in turn, led to other metals in the rocks dissolving, including the iron that gives the Tinto river its distinctive red colour and name. Amils thinks that some of the river's heavy metals are extracted from their ores by bact-eria living inside the rocks. This unique bio-sphere, he reckons, is powered by sulphur and iron. He says the river could serve as \u201can exhaust for a giant underground bioreactor\u201d. Although Amils and other biologists have quantified the microbial ecosystem at the surface 4 , 5 , the MARTE project has been their first opportunity to go underground. While Cannon is operating the robotic drill in the stuffy tent, Stoker and other members of the MARTE science team are enjoying the air-conditioning of the ultra-modern Center for Astrobiology building outside Madrid. Olga Prieto Ballesteros, head of the remote-operations team, marks the new core on a whiteboard. A satellite dish is relaying data from the drill site at a rate of 50 megabytes per day \u2014 roughly equivalent to the speed at which a spacecraft on Mars might be able to transmit information to Earth. The remote science team can access data from the drill's instruments, including pictures of the core and the output of an imaging spectrograph that helps identify the minerals present. This year, the team's month of drilling nets them a hole just over 6 metres deep. Geologists may snicker to call this deep drilling, but Stoker calls it an impressive accomplishment for a robotic drill loaded with science instruments. \u201cNothing like this has been done before,\u201d she says. If the remote researchers spot an interesting part of a core, they can get the robotic drill to subsample it, and pass the sample through sophisticated life-detection systems. The team can also instruct the drill to lower a camera into the borehole, to inspect the surrounding walls. In this case, the team knows there's a good chance that life could exist in the borehole. But it pretends otherwise. \u201cIf we see a filament in the rock, we know it's a root,\u201d says Ballesteros. But the root is sampled and tested before they conclude that it is life. Of the samples analysed already, \u201cwe have detected life in cores three and five\u201d, says a team biologist. The results come from the signs-of-life detector (SOLID) instrument, which uses a protein microarray to look for molecules that are characteristic of life. Astrobiologists routinely cite such techniques when they talk about searching for life on other planets 6 . Back at Rio Tinto, the drill is working hard to bring up new samples. It is designed to run with minimum human intervention. \u201cRight now, we're sitting here doing nothing,\u201d says Cannon. \u201cBut every once in a while something will fail and we have to step in.\u201d Terrestrial drillers would usually select their drill bit to suit the rock, and change the speed and power depending on the conditions they encounter. In contrast, a robotic drill on Mars is stuck on its own with just one drill bit and one technique. Another huge challenge is cleaning out the hole, to prevent the drill from clogging. On Earth some kind of fluid can be pumped down the drill shaft to remove the cuttings. This isn't feasible on Mars, so the drill built for the MARTE by New York-based Honeybee Robotics operates dry. \n               Lone worker \n             A screw around the outside of the drill bit is meant to carry the debris to the surface, but it keeps getting encrusted with muck. The team has resorted to vacuuming it clean. Red dust coats everything, including the laptops running the robot. As the robot ejects a new core, a researcher lunges inside the rig to catch it on sterilized tin foil. Moments later, she dabs a cotton bud over the core, swabbing material to analyse for ATP, the energy-rich molecule that acts as fuel for life on Earth. Samples destined for the SOLID instrument are rushed from the drilling tent to an air-conditioned vehicle next door, because the tent is too hot for the instrument to operate properly. Despite such difficulties, the MARTE team remains optimistic. They had not set out to solve every drilling and scientific question in 30 days. The point of the simulation, they say, was to see what works and what needs to be worked on. \u201cWe've got a lot of work to do, but this is a first step,\u201d says Cannon. Stoker agrees, and is enthusiastic about what they have learned: \u201cThis project has advanced the date the technology might be ready for a drilling mission \u2014 there's no doubt about that.\u201d Still, the project's US$6-million funding runs out this year, and it's unclear whether the drilling rig will get another outing. Biologists will be back at the Rio Tinto site, regardless. They may have drilled deep holes, but Amils says they've only scratched the surface of understanding how this ecosystem works. During a tour of some springs near the source of the Tinto, he notes the murky red, brown and white deposits in the water and on the surrounding rocks. Amils labels many of the oozy, lumpy patches \u2018scum\u2019, a euphemism for \u2018difficult to identify\u2019. Some are minerals, some are life. Most are not yet classified. Todd Stevens, his colleague and an expert in geomicrobiology from Portland State University in Oregon, sums it up: \u201cWe have a lot of work to do to understand the interactions of the rocks and microbes on Earth before we can do it on other planets.\u201d \n                     Mars exploration: Going underground \n                   \n                     Exobiology: It's life...isn't it? \n                   \n                     marte.arc.nasa.gov/index.html \n                   \n                     www.cab.inta.es/index.php \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Geoff Brumfiel asks why a physicist would want to enrol in biology lessons. This spring, David Hartley found himself leading a double life. By day, he was teaching a class at the University of Maryland School of Medicine in Baltimore. By night, he was a student at George Washington University in Washington DC. Hartley, a surface physicist by training, is one of a small but growing number of professional physical scientists who are going back to university to begin new careers in biology. Under a unique grant programme from the National Institutes of Health (NIH), about 20 mid-career scientists each year are going back into the classroom. The grants, known as K25s, allow researchers to spend up to five years learning the discipline of their choice. \u201cPhysics has always been the centre of my world, ever since I can remember,\u201d Hartley says. But by next spring, he will have completed a master's degree in public health and will begin an active research programme that will combine his knowledge of maths with his new-found love for epidemiology. Even second time round, university can be daunting. At 37, Hartley has found juggling the roles of student and researcher particularly testing. \u201cIt has been very taxing in the past year, trying to do research, teach, do coursework and maintain a life with my family,\u201d he says. His new student life has required a shift in thinking as much as a shift in routine. Trying to grasp the breadth of a field such as epidemiology is tricky, Hartley concedes. \u201cYou have sociologists, statisticians, epidemiologists and microbiologists all working in public health \u2014 and they don't necessarily speak the same language,\u201d he says. \u201cThe most challenging thing for me is getting my arms around all of this.\u201d Since the K25 programme began in 2000, the NIH has given out more than 120 grants to chemists, engineers, physicists and mathematicians, all of whom are looking to transfer their skills to biological research. From the agency's perspective the potential benefit is huge. Key developments in the biological sciences, such as protein crystallography, electron microscopy and magnetic resonance imaging, were all pioneered by physicists. And increasingly, biomedical science is being advanced by broad, interdisciplinary teams of diverse scientists, according to Norka Ruiz Bravo, the NIH's deputy director of extramural research. Hartley, who had spent years in private industry doing defence-related research, saw the K25 grant as a route back into academia. But for a scientist with the security of a faculty position, what is the motivation to switch fields in mid-career? For David Beebe, another K25 participant, it was a combination of professional interest and personal experience. After training as an electrical engineer, Beebe had become, at 41, a successful researcher in microfluidics, the flow of fluids through tiny channels. His 25-person lab at the University of Wisconsin at Madison was churning out about a dozen papers a year, and he was considered a leader in the field. \n               Switching subjects \n             Among other projects, Beebe began to experiment with ways that microfluidic channels might be used to automate certain aspects of the  in vitro  fertilization process. \u201cWe started doing some experiments and saw that, lo and behold, the embryos were developing almost as quickly as they were  in vivo , but we didn't know why,\u201d he says. \u201cI realized I needed to know more biology.\u201d Around the same time, Beebe says, he found himself becoming more personally drawn to biology. A friend had developed breast cancer, and that got him thinking about how his research might be able to contribute to advances in medicine. \u201cI really wanted to make a contribution to humankind, as silly as that sounds,\u201d he says. So Beebe decided to go back to school and study cancer biology. Originally he wanted to apply for a full PhD programme, but he was dissuaded by colleagues. \u201cMost of the people here said, \u2018You're crazy, why do you want to get another PhD?\u2019,\u201d he explains. Ultimately, he chose to focus on classes that interested him rather than trying to earn another degree. Once back in school, Beebe faced a culture shock. In his first year, he found himself in an undergraduate-level organic chemistry course, and was horrified to discover that many of his 300 classmates were more interested in discussing parties, sports, boys, and anything other than the organic molecules they were there to study. \u201cMy first reaction was, oh God, these guys are so immature,\u201d he says, \u201cbut then I stopped and thought, no, I was just like that.\u201d Beebe says that the experience has reminded him \u201cwhere his students' heads are at\u201d when they come to his classes. These experiences have also helped him to relate better to the students in his lab, according to Jaisree Moorthy, a postdoc and former graduate student of Beebe's. This is despite worries that the K25 programme would be disastrous for the lab. \u201cI had 20 graduate students, and only found out I got the grant a few months ahead,\u201d Beebe recalls. \u201cSo ramping down has really been the biggest struggle.\u201d But the programme has actually made Beebe more available to his students: \u201cSince Dr Beebe has gone back to school, he is more accessible as he does not travel as much,\u201d says Moorthy. Despite their overwhelming schedules, colleagues say that both researchers are already making significant contributions to their adopted fields. \u201cDavid Hartley really asks some interesting research questions,\u201d says Eli Perencevich, an epidemiologist at the University of Maryland. Last year, colleagues asked Hartley, Perencevich and others to study an outbreak of methicillin-resistant  Staphylococcus aureus that had occurred  in the university hospital's ward for prisoners. \u201cDavid started thinking about what a person who wanted to control an infection would need to know,\u201d Perencevich says. \u201cAnd he was able to take a very complex model and break it down into three or four parameters that infectious-health professionals could use to control it.\u201d Beebe's studies could have payoffs in the field of stem-cell research, according to his mentor Caroline Alexander, a geneticist at the University of Wisconsin. Alexander and Beebe have been collaborating on a mouse model of how breast cancer tumours develop. They believe that the origin of the tumours may be linked to stem cells in the mouse's breast. \u201cIt's become very interesting from a therapeutic point of view to understand the biology of these stem cells,\u201d she says. Researchers have long wanted to study how proteins secreted by these cells regulate their development. But this is almost impossible to do in a normal Petri dish because it contains millions of cells all signalling to each other at once, Alexander says. By contrast, the narrow channels in Beebe's microfluidic device hold far fewer cells, and their environment is easier to control. By switching the fluid flow through the channel on and off, the researchers can modify the signalling activity. \u201cThis is a great environment to test out how cells are regulating one another,\u201d Alexander says. \n               The road ahead \n             When Hartley finishes his courses next spring, his research will kick into high gear. Rather than a thesis, the second half of the K25 programme requires him to produce publishable research findings. Hartley plans to develop a mathematical model linking cholera outbreaks to environmental, social and climatic factors. Beebe says that after his courses end next autumn, he hopes to begin asking his own research questions, rather than following the cues from his collaborators. \u201cNext fall, I'll take complete ownership of my research,\u201d he says. \u201cTo me, that's going to be the big transition.\u201d For Ruiz Bravo, it's these research projects that make the K25 programme so valuable. \u201cLife science has moved from involving a single investigator in his or her lab to dealing with bigger types of problems that require large teams,\u201d she explains. Although the NIH is also actively training graduate students in multidisciplinary fields, there are some distinct advantages to recruiting mid-career researchers. \u201cThese researchers are already very well trained in their particular area,\u201d she says. \u201cThey bring a different approach to the life sciences.\u201d That approach is centre stage at the University of Maryland, where Hartley is giving what seems to be an introductory physics lecture. The differential equation on his overhead screen \u2014 familiar to any physicist \u2014 describes how a gas will diffuse through a room, but Hartley is using it to model how Chytridiomycota, a waterborne fungus that causes disease in amphibians, spreads in a population of frogs. His students, mostly epidemiologists, look forlornly at the mathematics overhead, and Hartley is sympathetic. He knows what it's like to be in their shoes: after class ends he will drive 100 kilometres south to attend a three-hour lecture in biostatistics. For now he smiles at his bewildered audience: \u201cYou guys wanted to learn more about this physics stuff,\u201d he reminds them. Hartley's students may take more convincing, but his new colleagues are enthusiastic about his changing career. Glenn Morris, who chairs the department of epidemiology and preventive medicine at the University of Maryland School of Medicine, says that he fought hard to bring Hartley to his department. \u201cThe physics guys are way ahead of us when it comes to modelling,\u201d he says. \u201cFor us to make progress, we've got to recognize the importance of these people from alien disciplines.\u201d \n                     Physics meets biology: Bridging the culture gap \n                   \n                     NIH Office of Extramural Research \n                   \n                     David Beebe's lab \n                   \n                     David Hartley's Page \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

It's not often that a science lecture can turn a person on to the idea of promiscuity. But when Michael Heinrich heard a talk about a promising new cancer drug, it triggered a transformation of his ideas about how to target disease. It sounds heretical, but Heinrich and others are now saying that \u2018magic bullet\u2019 drugs designed to hit single biological targets might not be the answer to treating complex illnesses such as cancer and cardiovascular disease. The future, they say, could be in drugs that are less picky about their molecular partners. Heinrich's turning point was a seminar given in early 1998 at the Oregon Health and Science University Cancer Institute in Portland, where he worked. Brian Druker, a molecular biologist in the medical department at the same university, was talking about the revolutionary leukaemia treatment Gleevec (imatinib mesylate). Made by Swiss drug company Novartis, Gleevec was designed to zero in on a single protein in cancerous cells, specifically killing them while leaving healthy cells unharmed. It proved to be spectacularly effective and non-toxic. Compared with the relatively indiscriminate action and distressing side effects of conventional cancer treatments, Gleevec seemed to vindicate the single-target approach to drug discovery. But it soon became clear that Gleevec was not as specific as its creators had thought. The drug works by attaching to a key part of an overactive protein that causes chronic myeloid leukaemia. In his lecture, Druker revealed that the drug also inhibits a second protein, known as the PDGF receptor. Sitting in the audience, Heinrich had a brainwave. At the time, he was working on a protein similar to PDGF called KIT. \u201cWe became interested in the idea that Gleevec could probably inhibit KIT as well,\u201d he says. Working with a team led by George Demetri and Jonathan Fletcher at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston, Massachusetts, Heinrich found that Gleevec was also remarkably effective against a rare cancer called gastrointestinal stromal tumour, known to be linked to faulty KIT activity 1 . What Heinrich and his colleagues had stumbled on went the opposite way from the direction that drug companies have been heading in since the beginning of the 1980s. In a bid to take much of the guesswork out of drug discovery, companies tried to avoid treatments that non-selectively bound to several targets \u2014 what they term \u2018dirty\u2019 or \u2018promiscuous\u2019 drugs \u2014 and focused on creating selective magic bullets such as Gleevec. But researchers are now realizing that too much specificity can also be problematic. \n               Take aim \n             Before the 1980s, drug discovery began by using animal models to test compounds created by medicinal chemists. Drugs were deemed successful by virtue of their effects rather than the number of molecular targets to which they bound. For every safe and effective promiscuous drug such as aspirin, there were good treatments that caused major side effects, and plenty of other drugs that were just plain unsafe. Trying to predict side effects and understand them was almost impossible as in most cases no one knew exactly how the drugs worked. The selective approach to drug discovery was made possible once biochemical and genetic studies began to reveal the molecular mechanisms that underlie common illnesses such as cancer and cardiovascular disease. Companies were able to pick a protein that they thought would make a good target, design compounds that interact with this protein, and test these compounds to find potential drugs. But 20 years down the line, it turns out that this target-based approach doesn't always guarantee success. Some of these selective drugs work in only a select population of patients. AstraZeneca's Iressa (gefitinib), for example, is designed to treat lung cancer by targeting a protein called EGFR. The drug does give an incredibly potent response, but only in about one-tenth of the patients who receive it 2 . And, as Gleevec fortuitously showed, treatments that block more than one target can be tolerated better than previously thought. The idea that promiscuous drugs might be more effective than targeted ones has also been emerging from efforts to understand how antipsychotic drugs work. The schizophrenia drug Clozaril (clozapine), for example, works because it targets a large number of proteins, says Bryan Roth, a biochemist at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland in Ohio. Variations designed to bind to fewer targets and reduce Clozaril's unpleasant side effects don't work as well and still have similar side effects 3 . In the 1990s, Roth and his team investigated which nerve-cell receptors were being targeted by a range of antipsychotic drugs. They found that the drugs that bound to the most receptors were the most successful in the clinic. \u201cWhat became clear to us when we examined antipsychotic drugs was that the more targets they hit the better,\u201d says Roth. \n               Multiple choice \n             The reason for this is that common disorders such as cancer, cardiovascular disease and depression tend to result from multiple molecular abnormalities, not from a single defect. What's more, pinpointing a single target is unlikely to help in many cases because cells can often find ways to compensate for a protein whose activity is affected by a drug, a phenomenon known as redundancy. Using what Roth calls \u2018magic shotguns\u2019 to target multiple points in these complex systems, could reap bigger therapeutic rewards than fully blocking one target. \u201cThe idea of the magic bullet continues to be a great idea, but in practice it's probably not going to be the right approach for complex diseases,\u201d says Roth. Findings such as those of Heinrich, Roth and their colleagues have triggered a recent shift in efforts to create drugs that hit more than one target simultaneously. A number of companies and research groups are now screening compounds that stick to several targets, or are even trying to engineer promiscuous drugs. Arguably, the biggest area for promiscuous drugs at the moment is cancer 4 . A key set of targets includes enzymes called kinases. Many of these, such as EGFR, influence how cells divide and are often abnormally active in cancers. A slew of treatments (see  \u2018\u201cDirty\u201d drugs under development\u2019 , right) that block several kinases together are now in clinical trials. The hope is that these will work better than highly selective treatments, and that hitting more than one kinase at once will reduce the chance of tumours becoming resistant to the drugs. In August, Pfizer submitted a cancer drug called Sutent (sunitinib malate), acquired when it bought the biotech company SUGEN, for approval to the US Food and Drug Administration. The drug blocks not only the proteins targeted by Gleevec, but also two other similar molecules 5 . Nevertheless, researchers in the field are frustrated that large drug companies seem to be ignoring the advantages of promiscuity, or polypharmacology as it is sometimes known. \u201cThere is still a perception in the field that multi-kinase inhibitors are going to be inherently toxic and non-selective and it's absolutely untrue,\u201d says Julie Cherrington, executive vice-president for research and development at Phenomix in San Diego, California, who helped develop Sutent when she was at SUGEN. \u201cI can remember having conversations about this when we started to develop Sutent, and I'm still having these conversations now.\u201d Big pharmaceutical companies are largely still wedded to the \u2018one-target one-disease\u2019 model, and it's not easy to change this culture, says Simon Mencher, principal at Natrogen Therapeutics in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. \u201cThe first person I ever talked to in a large company about promiscuous drugs said: \u2018I agree with you but I can't convince the management to change the way they work\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cToo much funding has been sunk into targeting single agents.\u201d \n               Culture shock \n             Andrew Hopkins, head of knowledge discovery at Pfizer in Sandwich, UK, agrees that the single-target approach remains the main strategy in big companies. But this is now being challenged by fresh information on some compounds, as well as by models mimicking the effect of compounds on cells. In addition, large-scale genetic projects have confirmed the extent of redundancy by showing that altering the activity of many genes one at a time may have limited clinical effect 6 . \u201cPolypharmacology isn't new, what is new is the realization of its importance in efficacy,\u201d says Hopkins. But screening for compounds that hit multiple targets is a difficult task. Unlike the single-target strategy, in which the compound selected is generally the one that sticks best to the target, the most likely candidate for a multi-target drug will be one that moderately influences several targets positively and negatively at the appropriate concentrations. Overcoming this problem requires a deeper understanding of the cellular mechanisms at which the drug is aimed. To tackle this, researchers have turned to the emerging field of network biology, which can model the complex interactions between all the molecular constituents of a cell 7 . By building these networks, researchers can identify molecules and processes that are altered in diseases. They can also predict whether it is better to design drugs that hit multiple points in one process or that dampen parallel processes, and whether redundancy will be a factor. If multiple-kinase inhibitors prove successful in the clinic, they could drive more efforts towards promiscuous drugs. Already the Gleevec story is having an impact in industry, says Roth. He has noticed a subtle change in the drugs that large companies are licensing from smaller companies. \u201cBoth Pfizer and Merck have licensed relatively non-selective antipsychotic compounds,\u201d says Roth. \u201cThe fact that they are doing this shows that they're getting the message.\u201d \n                     Multi-kinase inhibitors create buzz at ASCO \n                   \n                     Drug Discovery Channel \n                   \n                     Cell division web focus \n                   \n                     Computational Biology Web Focus \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Is it time to move away from biodiversity \u2018hotspots\u2019, and stress the economic value of ecosystems? Lucy Odling-Smee investigates. The Florida panther is living on the edge. Once, these majestic cats prowled throughout the southeastern United States. But today, fewer than 90 of the creatures cling to fragments of habitat in southern Florida. And not everyone agrees that efforts to save this subspecies make economic or scientific sense. Male Florida panthers ( Puma concolor coryi ) stalk hunting grounds that average 550 square kilometres. Given the exorbitant cost of land in the Sunshine State, protecting sufficient habitat to support a population viable over the long term is a tall order. And although some argue that protecting the panther will rescue other threatened animals and plants along the way, this remains little more than an article of faith. Even the panther's evolutionary heritage has been called into question: genetic studies suggest that it is not as distinct from other subspecies of mountain lion as was once thought 1 . Attempts to save the Florida panther epitomize an approach to conservation that is increasingly coming under fire. A new, hard-headed breed of conservationists say we should not concentrate exclusively on saving the rare and endangered or on protecting species diversity. Instead, they say, decisions need to be made within a rigorous economic framework. Some argue that the key to effective conservation is quantifying and promoting the economic \u2018services\u2019 that ecosystems provide for people \u2014 a mantra that has gained momentum with the completion this year of the most comprehensive survey yet of these benefits, the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment 2 . At the same time, conservationists are being urged to develop better tools to measure the effectiveness of their projects, and to share data on best practice. In other words, say critics, it's time for the organizations involved in conservation to admit that they are fallible, and to learn from past mistakes (see  \u2018Taking quackery out of conservation\u2019 ). \n               On the spot \n             In recent years, the field of conservation biology has been dominated by the goal of preserving biodiversity \u2014 a slippery concept, which can be defined in various ways. The most dramatic push came from an article 3  published in 1988 by Norman Myers, then at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York. His paper introduced the idea of biodiversity \u2018hotspots\u2019. To earn hotspot status, Myers said, a region must contain 1,500 or more endemic plant species, which are found in that area but nowhere else, and it must have lost at least 70% of its original habitat. Myers identified ten areas of tropical forest as hotspots on the basis of these criteria. It was a seductive idea: focusing scarce resources for conservation on hotspots offered maximum bang for buck. Conservation International, one of the leading organizations in the field, adopted the idea as its guiding principle in 1989. And subsequent analyses by Myers and others extended the concept from tropical forests to other habitat types and taxonomic groups 4 . Conservation International, based in Washington DC, now recognizes 34 hotspots. These occupy just 2.3% of the Earth's land surface, yet are the sole home of half the world's vascular plant species and 42% of terrestrial vertebrates. \u201cConservation International's maps have been an incredible political tool,\u201d says Ian Owens, a conservation biologist at Imperial College London. \u201cThey made rescuing biodiversity seem achievable.\u201d But recently, the hotspot concept has come under fire. Analyses have revealed an alarming lack of overlap between hotspots identified using different criteria 5 , 6  (see map, below). And some experts argue that focusing on biodiversity hotspots is fundamentally misguided. \u201cIt's like being a butterfly collector or having a zoo in which you protect a tiny sample of the Earth,\u201d says Peter Kareiva, a lead scientist for The Nature Conservancy, based in Arlington, Virginia. \u201cMeanwhile, you could be ignoring ecosystems that are hugely important to humankind.\u201d Hotspots are \u201cquestions waiting for answers\u201d, concludes Hugh Possingham, a mathematician and conservation biologist at the University of Queensland in Brisbane, Australia. He echoes Kareiva's call for emphasis on the importance of ecosystems to people, and wants conservation biologists to embrace the tools of decision theory. This theory is widely used in planning by engineers and financial advisers to work out how their funds should best be allocated. Mapping more of the world's biodiversity hotspots is \u201clike fixing the antenna on your car when the engine's broken\u201d, Possingham quips. Possingham and his colleagues argue that spending money on those areas containing the most species at risk of extinction isn't necessarily the best strategy. Often, these are areas in which there is a small chance of success \u2014 because of overwhelming development pressure or official corruption, for example. In many cases the future of areas with fewer threatened species can be secured more easily and cheaply, he says. In their current work, as yet unpublished, Possingham and his colleagues are using decision theory to lay economic factors over the maps of priority areas used by major conservation organizations. After plugging in the cost of action \u2014 which depends on factors such as land prices and human population density \u2014 their algorithms churn out an optimized strategy for allocating a limited pot of conservation funds. Kareiva sees Possingham's analyses as an early sign of a much-needed shift in thinking. \u201cThe whole conservation movement needs to deal more with people and with ecosystem services,\u201d he says. If it did so, he suggests, greater emphasis would be given to habitats such as the vast tracts of boreal forest that stretch from Russia to Canada. Nicknamed \u2018the world's lung\u2019, this habitat is an important carbon sink, providing a natural brake on the greenhouse effect, and it is arguably the planet's most important nitrogen-fixing ecosystem. Yet boreal forests are not a priority for several major international conservation groups. \n               Service not included \n             Natural ecosystems provide a wide variety of resources that have a social and economic value. These include services, such as clean water, stable soils and protection against natural catastrophes, and potential benefits, such as a storehouse of biodiversity from which drugs might be discovered. But studies to quantify these benefits, especially the financial costs and gains attached to protecting them, are only just beginning to gain momentum. Preliminary results are eye-opening. Recent research indicates that the catastrophic loss of life seen in the Asian tsunami of 26 December 2004 could have been lessened had the clearance of Sri Lankan mangrove forests been prevented 7 . In Costa Rica, experiments have shown that maintaining a patch of forest, and so a supply of pollinators, near coffee plantations increases coffee yields by 20% \u2014 an economic gain that easily matches revenues obtained by converting the forest to farmland 8 . At least now there is a solid base on which to build further analyses of the costs and benefits of protecting specific ecosystems: the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment. Requested by United Nations secretary-general Kofi Annan, it has been drawn up by more than 1,300 researchers from 95 nations over four years. It reviews the state of 24 different ecosystem services \u2014 from easily measured benefits, such as the provision of food, to elusive ones, which include the regulation of air quality and climate. Of these 24 services, 60% are being degraded, and fast 2 . Those involved in the assessment are disappointed with the response so far from the world's media and politicians. \u201cIf you went out and said we've looked at 24 indicators of economic well-being, and only four of them are improving, and of those four, one is about to crash, the world would panic,\u201d says Georgina Mace, a conservation biologist with the Zoological Society of London. The problem, she suggests, is that people aren't yet used to thinking about the environment as an economic resource. \n               Capital ideas \n             Nevertheless, the message is being picked up by influential figures within the conservation movement. Among the converts is Eric Dinerstein, chief scientist with the WWF, formerly the World Wide Fund for Nature, in Washington DC. \u201cI don't think conservationists have sufficiently exploited the value of certain habitats that maintain services essential for human life and welfare,\u201d he says. Eager to capitalize on this approach, the WWF is planning a scheme called \u2018hydrosheds\u2019. This will use climate and hydrological models to identify the places where people get their water from. The goal is to produce a series of maps that can convince governments of the merits of conserving habitats that include economically important watersheds. The practical difficulties of making such arguments work, however, are daunting. Andrew Laurie is chief technical adviser to a wetlands biodiversity project in China funded by the United Nations Development Programme and the Global Environment Facility. As well as providing diverse habitats for animal and plant species endemic to China, the wetlands that Laurie is trying to protect act as water purifiers, floodwater and climate regulators, and suppliers of grass and reed building materials. Although the overall cost\u2013benefit analysis gives a strong economic case for conservation, the equation is different for local farmers, who would lose the opportunity to convert wetlands for their own use. Devising specific financial mechanisms to reward these farmers will be key to success. In Laurie's wetlands, there is at least a strong overlap between protecting biodiversity and promoting ecosystem services. Elsewhere, this isn't necessarily the case. Boreal forests, for instance, fare poorly on standard measures of biodiversity. And economic arguments relating to ecosystem services can, in some cases, usurp the goal of conserving wildlife. \u201cYou can cut down a mountain-top forest that has a lot of rare endemics, plant eucalyptus and probably get the same watershed benefit from the introduced exotics as you would from native plants,\u201d Dinerstein admits. Indeed, many conservation biologists are concerned that giving natural habitat a monetary value risks losing sight of the ethical and spiritual dimensions of conservation \u2014 driving forces in campaigns such as those to save the Florida panther. \u201cWe mustn't rely only on an ecosystem-services approach because it misses out so much,\u201d says Laurie. \u201cThe argument that only by instilling respect for life are we going to get anywhere with conservation still carries a lot of weight.\u201d But against the backdrop of environmental devastation now gripping the planet, and the scant resources devoted to conservation, there is a growing realization that economic arguments must become a key weapon in the movement's arsenal. \u201cIf conservation is to have any chance of being relevant in the next century,\u201d warns Kareiva, \u201cit will only be because we have figured out how to protect ecosystem services at the same time as we protect biodiversity.\u201d \n                     Species hotspots hard to pin down \n                   \n                     Industry lured by the gains of going green \n                   \n                     Corruption is undermining conservation \n                   \n                     Hundreds of threatened species falling through conservation gaps \n                   \n                     Millennium Ecosystem Assessment \n                   \n                     Biodiversity Hotspots \n                   \n                     ConservationEvidence.com \n                   \n                     Centre for Evidence-Based Conservation \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Jeff Kanipe meets the new custodian of everyone's favourite space telescope. Mattias Mountain seems cheerful as he sits at a desk littered with spreadsheets and organizational charts. This month he has become the director of the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, Maryland, at a time when the 25-year-old body is making an even bigger transition \u2014 from managing the popular workhorse of space astronomy, the Hubble Space Telescope, to its planned successor, the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). Amid concerns that Hubble will be retired sooner than expected, and with JWST running behind schedule and over budget, the outlook for the institute seems far from rosy. Mountain admits that some of his friends have questioned his reasoning for taking the job but says he assures them: \u201cI wouldn't have come here if I thought we were in our death throes.\u201d Under a contract with NASA, the 400-person institute is responsible for research done with the $1.5-billion Hubble telescope. When the space shuttle lofted Hubble into orbit in 1990, it launched a bold new era in observational astronomy \u2014 albeit after a false start. The incorrect curvature of Hubble's 2.4-metre primary mirror prevented light rays from converging at a single focus, blurring its vision. Only after a shuttle mission in 1993, during which astronauts installed corrective optics, did the bold new era truly begin. And what a time it has been. In the ensuing years, Hubble has narrowed the age of the Universe to between 13 and 14 billion years, probed the violent hearts of galaxies, revealed dusty cocoons around newborn stars, helped to establish that cosmic expansion is accelerating and scoured the darkest, deepest reaches of space for primordial galaxies coalescing in a Universe less than a billion years old. Those were good times at the institute, which gained a reputation for smooth data management and slick public outreach. And beyond the pretty pictures, some 400 to 600 science papers are generated each year from Hubble-based data. Hoping to keep Hubble working productively until 2010, the institute planned a fifth shuttle servicing mission to replace ageing batteries and gyroscopes, and to add new instruments. But events outside the institute's control have made such hopes ever more remote. First, the disintegration of the Columbia orbiter during re-entry in 2003 led NASA to suspend shuttle missions. Then, this July, the shuttle Discovery narrowly escaped debris damage during the first shuttle launch since the Columbia disaster. In response, the new NASA administrator, Mike Griffin, has grounded the fleet for a second time. \n               Looking into a void \n             Although Griffin has said publicly that he is willing to reconsider a Hubble mission, time is running out. Even if shuttle flights resume next year, it is unlikely that a servicing mission would fly before late 2007. This may be too late to save Hubble should it lose battery power or if any more of its stabilizing gyroscopes should fail in the meantime. Just last month, NASA announced that engineers were shutting down one of the three remaining gyroscopes to extend the telescope's operating life until, possibly, mid-2008. Despite this, Mountain remains optimistic about Hubble's future. \u201cI think everybody thinks one shuttle servicing mission is a good idea, including the administrator,\u201d he says. More critical to the future of the institute are the budgetary woes of the James Webb Space Telescope, projected to launch in 2011 at a cost of $3.5 billion. Although not a direct successor to Hubble \u2014 JWST will observe mainly in the infrared \u2014 US astronomers picked the telescope as their top priority following a decadal review in 2000. The potential science to be done with the 6.5 metre infrared telescope is impressive: from observing the motions of young planetary systems around other stars to imaging the first ever galaxies to form in the Universe. But cost overruns are forcing astronomers to consider reducing the telescope's overall sensitivity and, perhaps, dropping other instruments entirely. There is also a good chance that the launch date will slip to 2013. This could mean a long, dry period for the institute, whose staff are used to issuing a stream of data to astronomers worldwide. But Mountain is not worried about morale: \u201cThe spirits I detect around the corridors here are fairly upbeat. Now, I wouldn't say they're bubbling over, because NASA is putting budget constraints on this place, and that's a new experience for them.\u201d As the former director of the Gemini Observatory, which operates two identical 8 metre telescopes in Hawaii and Chile, Mountain is no stranger to budgetary and instrumentation challenges. At Gemini, he learned that tight budget constraints can be another way of stimulating creativity. \u201cI'm a great believer in the partnership between science, engineering and project management,\u201d he says, \u201cTo me it's a creative tension.\u201d \n               The big picture \n             Mountain will certainly need creativity to navigate the obstacles ahead. Craig Wheeler of the University of Texas at Austin, and president-elect of the American Astronomical Society, cautions: \u201cI don't have any particular reason to think that he's not up to it, but I don't know whether he's faced quite this kind of challenge before. It's a big job.\u201d Many of Mountain's former colleagues are confident that he can pull it off, though. \u201cOne of Matt's real strengths is that he doesn't lose sight of the big picture,\u201d says Phil Puxley, in charge of Gemini's southern telescope in Chile. \u201cHe's delivered instruments and telescopes on a very tight schedule and under a lot of budget pressure. That's a very rare thing to do once, and he's now done it more than once.\u201d The cost overruns, Mountain asserts, are not as bad as they seem. \u201cIf you ask a contractor what's the possible maximum cost,\u201d he says, \u201cthey always give you the worst-case scenario.\u201d When you add those contractors' estimates, he says, plus the cost of launch delays and NASA's estimates for unforeseen technical problems, the budget busts by a billion dollars. He argues the true figure for the overrun is closer to $500 million \u2014 one that, fortuitously or not, matches savings that project scientists have recently put on the table. Whatever the true amount, JWST's science working group, of which Mountain is a member, has worked hard since May to make savings while preserving as much of the telescope's performance as possible. One option, to reduce the overall size of the mirror array to 4 metres, was quickly rejected. Another option, to polish the mirrors once instead of twice, preserves the array's size but reduces its sensitivity at wavelengths shorter than 1.7 micrometres, the range that includes visible light. JWST was designed to operate at wavelengths between 0.6 to 28 micrometres, but it has always been primarily an infrared telescope, so the loss of the optical range doesn't concern Mountain. \u201cBeyond 1.7 micrometres, JWST is supreme,\u201d he says. \u201cMy view is you don't need the optical.\u201d Not everyone agrees. \u201cWe have certainly not run out of intriguing problems to be addressed in the optical range,\u201d says former Hubble project scientist Robert O'Dell of Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee. \u201cThe loss of the optical band on the JWST will mean that there won't be a telescope that will do what we can right now. This loss will be serious.\u201d Others warn of a potential observing \u2018gap\u2019 for certain observations, particularly if Hubble expires before JWST is operational. Astronomers say that further observations of type Ia supernovae, which they used to confirm that the Universe's expansion is accelerating, are needed to pinpoint exactly when acceleration began, and also to provide insights into the nature of dark energy, the force thought to be behind the acceleration. Losing the visible spectrum from 0.6 to 0.8 micrometres would not be a tragedy, says the institute's Adam Riess, whose team first announced the supernova result in 1998, but losing infrared from 0.8 to 1.2 would hurt without Hubble and \u201cwould leave us without any observatory to fill this niche\u201d. Mountain points out that JWST will have capabilities down to 0.6 micrometres, but without a second polish the performance will be degraded. He says astronomers will have to take what they can get at the shorter wavelengths. While the JWST debate promises to dog Mountain's first year at the institute, he must also contend with a political tug of war over the ageing Hubble. Mountain says he understands Griffin's reluctance to commit to a servicing mission until there have been two safe shuttle flights. \u201cIt's the administrator's call,\u201d he says. \u201cBoth the current and previous NASA administrators have stressed that the decision is not a financial one but rather one of safety.\u201d Griffin himself confirms that neither money nor safety is the primary concern. \u201cThe shuttle now operates under new constraints involving inspection requirements, use of spacewalk time and other factors which may limit its utility as a repair platform for Hubble,\u201d he explains. \u201cIt is too soon to be optimistic. If we fly the next mission in the spring of 2006, as we hope to do, and if all goes well, then we could be prepared to execute a Hubble mission in late 2007.\u201d Although the current servicing mission is a big headache for the institute, JWST could be the source of many more, even once it is launched. Unlike Hubble, JWST will be stationed some 1.5 million kilometres from Earth, too far for rescue missions. This means the finished telescope must have no imperfections, nor parts that wear out fast. Mountain knows that the institute cannot rest on its laurels. \u201cThis is a very successful institution with a very motivated staff, and I think they feel that their past record justifies their continued existence,\u201d he says. \u201cThat's an understandable motivation, but it's not sufficient. We're going to have to earn our future.\u201d \n                     Hubble versus the future \n                   \n                     NASA under pressure to extend Hubble's life \n                   \n                     Astronomers urge NASA not to cut corners on Hubble successor \n                   \n                     Space Telescope Science Institute \n                   \n                     Northrop Grumman Space Technology \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},
{"file_id": "437807a", "url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/437807a", "year": 2005, "authors": [{"name": "Emma Marris"}], "parsed_as_year": "2006_or_before", "body": "The friction that arises when a scientific society aims both to serve its members and stay commercially competitive is generating heat within the American Chemical Society. Emma Marris takes the society's temperature.  The American Chemical Society (ACS) is the world's largest scientific society. Composed of more than 158,000 chemists from industry and academia, and employing some 2,000 members of staff, the society's assets total $1 billion. It publishes journals, holds meetings, provides career services, educates the public about chemistry, rubs shoulders with lawmakers, trains teachers, gives out grants and scholarships, and even sells insurance.  The society owes most of its wealth to its two \u2018information services\u2019 divisions \u2014 the publications arm and the Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS), a rich database of chemical information and literature. Together, in 2004, these divisions made about $340 million \u2014 82% of the society's revenue \u2014 and accounted for $300 million (74%) of its expenditure. Over the past five years, the society has seen its revenue and expenditure grow steadily (see chart, below). Although the ACS is a non-profit organization, the information-services divisions are increasingly being run like businesses. Any net revenue is naturally fed back into the society's other activities, but the business-like attitude is making some ACS members uneasy. A small but vocal group of critics fears that business priorities are supplanting the goal laid out in the society's charter: \u201cto encourage in the broadest and most liberal manner the advancement of chemistry and all its branches\u201d. This is the heart of the matter, for the ACS, or for any society with substantial revenues: can a non-profit organization always afford to put its members' interests first? An ongoing dispute between the ACS and the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) reflects some of the problems. The NIH has recently unveiled a freely accessible database called PubChem, which provides information on the biological activity of small molecules. The ACS sees this as unfair competition to the fee-based CAS because it is taxpayer-funded, and the society wants the database restricted to molecules that have been screened by NIH centres. A few ACS members argue that the society is being unduly aggressive in protecting CAS and ought not to be challenging the scope of a database that could be a useful and free resource for chemists. For the record,  Nature 's sister journal  Nature Chemical Biology  links all of its articles to PubChem. \u201cI am growing increasingly upset with their direction,\u201d says Chris Reed, an inorganic chemist at the University of California, Riverside, and one of the more outspoken critics of the ACS. \u201cThey have a culture of a for-profit corporation.\u201d The ACS says that it is run by its members, and that the 2,000 staff ultimately follow the will of elected officers, including the democratically elected 16-member board of directors, who sit at the top of a complex system of \u2018governance\u2019. Between 13,000 and 20,000 members serve on the society's innumerable boards and committees, although many boards meet only a few times a year and some have limited advisory power. Consequently, the hired staff make most of the operational decisions. \u201cWe have a very democratic organization,\u201d says William Carroll of Occidental Chemical and president of the ACS. \u201cI think the organization, for one as big as it is, is pretty responsive.\u201d Staff and volunteers in governance believe that the ACS can run a competitive business while putting its members' interests first. \u201cThe staff here serves governance,\u201d says Madeleine Jacobs, executive director of the society and former editor-in-chief of its weekly magazine,  Chemical and Engineering News . But membership dissatisfaction bubbled to the surface on 29 August at the society's national meeting in Washington DC during an open session for the CAS and publications divisions. ACS member David Spellmeyer of the IBM Almaden Research Center in San Jose, California, had distributed yellow flyers encouraging people to attend the meeting if they wanted to know more about the PubChem debate. But at the meeting, the director of CAS, Robert Massie, twice declined to discuss PubChem, each time suggesting that interested members talk privately with Brian Dougherty, senior ACS adviser on PubChem who sat at the very back of the room. When he passed over the topic for a second time, saying, \u201cAs I said, Brian is here. I suggest you talk to him directly,\u201d a substantial chunk of the meeting got up and left the room. \n               Heated argument \n             Outside in the corridor, Dougherty found himself surrounded by a knot of angry chemists clutching yellow flyers. Dougherty was conciliatory, but the members were obviously frustrated. \u201cThis is offensive,\u201d said one. Dougherty and other staff had first seen the flyers that morning. They had not planned to mention PubChem at the meeting and they decided to stick to the programme, which featured updates such as the introduction of CAS for BlackBerry wireless Internet devices. \u201cThey are normally one-hour meetings,\u201d says Dougherty. \u201cWas it appropriate for us to turn that into an open forum on PubChem?\u201d He says he suspects that both Jacobs and Carroll would have liked to be present at any such debate. \u201cThat was the best decision at the time, and in hindsight, I think we did the right thing,\u201d he adds. Not all ACS members are happy with that decision. Two, including Spellmeyer, resigned in protest from an advisory committee on CAS following the incident, which came just a day after the committee passed a resolution calling for more open dialogue on PubChem between the ACS and its members. One CAS committee member, who preferred not to be named, says: \u201cThe ACS had made some choices about what, where and how to communicate. We would like them to rethink those choices. We felt the membership was not well informed.\u201d  Last year's ACS president, Charles Casey of the University of Wisconsin, Madison, who serves on the board of directors, admits that the society has not communicated well on the PubChem issue. \u201cI think there is an effort now to do better,\u201d he says. \u201cI think this is an isolated problem, and one that will get corrected.\u201d Dougherty says the staff has taken the CAS committee's resolution to heart. \u201cWe have our orders to improve communication. There is not an action plan, with dates attached, but it will happen,\u201d he says. As dramatic as the scene in Washington was, the crowd in the hallway numbered fewer than a dozen chemists. An ACS survey that randomly polled some 3,500 members by e-mail in 2004 revealed only 5% who said they were not satisfied with the organization. Most approve of the ACS.  Still, as Jacobs says: \u201cThere is a small group of people who feel passionately about their issues. Those individuals have real concerns and we have been trying to address them.\u201d But policy decisions on questions such as PubChem have to be made expeditiously by the staff, she says. \u201cYou can't, for every single issue, poll 158,000 members.\u201d \n               Abstract art \n             According to Jacobs, CAS is the one thing, besides the society's sheer size, that makes the ACS unique. This operation sells various tools that can bring up a body of research on a chemical with a few keystrokes. \u201cThat's an anomaly of the ACS, but also our strength. No other professional society in the world has a publications arm like CAS,\u201d says Jacobs. Based in Columbus, Ohio, CAS is 100 years old, and has become essential for chemists: search tools that mine the core database are purchased by virtually every chemistry company or research university. Massie, who has a background in management consultancy, is the first non-chemist to head the division. \u201cBob Massie was definitely hired to move CAS into the modern age, and he has succeeded,\u201d says Jacobs. \u201cIts current success is most assuredly due to his leadership.\u201d Under his management, CAS has not been shy of protecting its business interests. In 2002, it sued a company called Leadscope in Columbus, Ohio, founded by three former employees, two of whom are chemists and ACS members. The ACS said that the three were selling a software program too similar to one they had worked on for the society, where they had signed agreements giving ACS the rights to their creations. That suit is on hold, and Jacobs says that she expects it will be settled out of court. Leadscope chief executive Loftus Lucas said in documents submitted as part of the lawsuit that the ACS timed its suit to scare off a potential financer. \u201cThey sued us in a rushed submission, one week before Leadscope was doing a last round of financing,\u201d he says. \u201cThey elected, apparently, to try to put us out of business.\u201d The society denies this. In a statement it said: \u201cACS brought suit against the defendants for the reasons stated in the complaint, including breach of employment agreement and misappropriation of intellectual property belonging to CAS. These are the only reasons for the lawsuit, and any other allegations are incorrect.\u201d \n               Scholarly debate \n             In December 2004, the ACS also launched a suit against Internet search engine Google over trademark infringement for its use of the word \u2018scholar\u2019. The ACS alleges that the new academic search engine Google Scholar is trading off the reputation built up by the society's popular database search tool, SciFinder Scholar. And, most controversially, CAS has disputed the scope of the NIH's free database, PubChem. But the NIH sees the two databases as complementary tools and doesn't want to restrict its operations. Negotiations continue between the parties, and visits to lawmakers have been made by both sides. \u201cIt takes something pretty dramatic for us to go out to Capitol Hill and not talk about science but about something that would affect our operation,\u201d says Dougherty. He predicts that the disagreement will be resolved within a year.  Some ACS members who are also fans of PubChem feel that their voices have been lost in this debate. Steve Heller, who lives in Silver Spring, Maryland, is part of an e-mail list-server community that is a source of lively discussion on this issue. Heller is a retired chemist and ACS member who also serves on an NIH advisory board on PubChem. \u201cIt seems as if those members of the ACS who see and know what is going on \u2014 and it is not a very large number \u2014 are very upset that the management and staff are taking a position without any consultation with the membership or discussion with experts in the field, and doing things that are not in the interest of their members, who want this for free,\u201d he says. \u201cIt just seems to me like such a conflict of interest with their own mission,\u201d agrees Heather Joseph, executive director of the Washington-based Scholarly Publishing and Academic Resources Coalition, an alliance of libraries that supports open access to the scientific literature. \u201cFor science to be conducted effectively, open access to data has to be part of the landscape.\u201d \n               Steady state \n             Massie told  Nature  he did not have time to be interviewed for this article, but he and other ACS staff and officers are on record as saying that keeping CAS thriving and in the hands of the ACS is the best thing for science. Jacobs argues that for the NIH \u201cto duplicate what the private sector does well, does not seem to me to be a good use of taxpayer money\u201d. Things seem calmer in the publications division, which was reorganized along more commercial lines in the 1990s. \u201cWe weren't competing,\u201d recalls Ned Heindel, a past ACS president at Lehigh University in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. \u201cEventually it was decided that management of the publications should be done by true professionals.\u201d In 1996, oversight moved from a committee of volunteers that met biannually to a Governing Board for Publishing, including four compensated publishing experts. Robert Bovenschulte, a veteran commercial publisher, was hired to run the division. \u201cWe are now positioned to respond to the market and move page allocations around,\u201d says Heindel. The ACS has since expanded the number of titles and done quite well in a field where everyone is feeling the pinch of shrinking library budgets, increasing costs, ballooning submissions, and the parallel rises of the Internet and open-access publications. In response to the proponents of open access, some of whom argue that if the society's objective is to promote the field of chemistry it ought to give all its journal articles away for free, Bovenschulte replies that the ACS has to charge to keep the publications division strong and dynamic. \u201cIn addition, the society does require that both CAS and publications generate a small net contribution or surplus, and those monies support the good works that the society does,\u201d he says. \u201cThey give me targets and I have to make them.\u201d Bovenschulte adds that there have been occasions when business concerns have been trumped by members' interests, but he said he preferred not to name them for fear of reviving old squabbles. Most critics of the ACS believe that their best shot at changing the society is to find a way to penetrate the committees and boards that govern it \u2014 for example, by electing like-minded individuals to the board of directors, which hires executive staff. Or they could aim for the Governing Board for Publishing, which covers CAS as well as publications. In addition to its four publishing experts, the chair of the board of directors, Jacobs, Massie and Bovenschulte, the board has slots for two ACS members, as long as they have executive-level experience. Reed hopes to gather together the disgruntled into an e-mail list, and eventually into a slate of candidates for various ACS offices to run on a reform platform. \u201cI think it is going to require a grassroots movement,\u201d he says. \u201cI don't see how members' complaints, letters to the editor, or e-mails to the governing board are changing anything.\u201d Many of the critics remain deeply engaged with the society. They attend national meetings and vote in elections. And they generally like the ACS. \u201cOn the whole, the society brings a great deal of value to its members,\u201d says Spellmeyer. Heller feels the same way. \u201cThere are benefits to being a member and being part of a community,\u201d he says. Heller and others hope that they can change the society from the inside. \u201cIf you decide you aren't happy with the current governor or mayor, you don't move out of the city or state, you wait for the next election,\u201d he says. This sentiment was echoed by Jacobs in a statement released on 26 September: \u201cI firmly believe on PubChem and other issues, it's much more productive to work through our Society, than outside it.\u201d On that, at least, there is some agreement. \n                     Chemistry society goes head to head with NIH in fight over public database \n                   \n                     Director's salary makes chemists see red \n                   \n                     American Chemical Society \n                   \n                     www.chemistry.org \n                   \n                     pubs.acs.org \n                   \n                     www.cas.org \n                   \n                     pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},
{"file_id": "437612a", "url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/437612a", "year": 2005, "authors": [{"name": "Robert Cooke"}], "parsed_as_year": "2006_or_before", "body": "Marine scientists are getting ready for their newest tool, a versatile robot submersible that can travel into the oceans' deepest abyss. Robert Cooke visits the Massachusetts lab where the future of deep-sea exploration is taking shape. With a typhoon bearing down, the operators of the ship  Kairei  made what seemed the sensible decision: they hauled in their lines and planned to leave the area. Only these were no ordinary fishing lines, but a kilometres-long stretch of cable leading to the world's deepest-diving submersible. And when  Kairei 's crew winched up the last of the cable, something was missing \u2014 the vehicle on the end, whose line had apparently snapped. The future of deep-sea exploration darkened a bit on that stormy day in 2003. The  Kairei 's submersible,  Kaiko , was the star not only of the Japan Agency for Marine\u2013Earth Science and Technology but of the world's entire deep-diving fleet. In 1995,  Kaiko  had touched down on the bottom of the Challenger Deep in the Marianas Trench, 11,000 metres beneath the waves. It was only the second time a submersible had visited the legendary deep, and a first for a robotic craft. But now, it looks as though  Kaiko  is to be replaced \u2014 and perhaps improved upon. At Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI) in Massachusetts, home of the celebrated research submarine  Alvin , marine engineers are preparing another vehicle to probe the deepest, darkest regions of the sea. Some components are still being designed, and even the overall shape has yet to be decided, but the engineers plan to have the vehicle in the water next summer and ready to dive to the Challenger Deep by 2007. The craft, they say, will be much more than a replacement for the lost  Kaiko  or even for  Alvin , which is due to be retired in the next four years or so. The new submersible will be a multi-talented, adaptable machine that can traverse the ocean in one of two configurations \u2014 self-guiding or controlled by surface operators through a whisker-thin fibre-optic cable. It's a combination of two successful marine exploration technologies \u2014 hence its unromantic designation of HROV, for Hybrid Remotely Operated Vehicle. Like  Alvin , but without a crew, the submersible will take pictures and video images, search with sonar signals, and grab rock and sediment samples off the sea floor. But on some missions, the HROV will also be sent off to go exploring on its own, in an autonomous mode for wide-area surveys. Although the HROV will be the first submersible able to work either tethered or autonomously, the advantages of each mode are well proven. Autonomous underwater vehicles have made a name for themselves in wide-field surveys and other tasks where constant monitoring is not required (see  Nature   421 , 468\u2013470; 2003). Freed from a tether, they can robotically \u2018fly\u2019 an underwater pattern to gather data on phenomena as different as hydrothermal vents and algal blooms. Remotely operated vehicles such as WHOI's  Jason II , on the other hand, have the advantage that they can be steered to particular spots of interest, such as a newly formed hydrothermal vent. But the tethering cables produce drag, making these vehicles harder and slower to manoeuvre in the water. \n               Control and freedom \n             The $5-million HROV is designed to have the best of both worlds. \u201cWe'll get a great deal of flexibility by being able to rearrange it,\u201d says Robert Detrick, vice-president for marine facilities and operations at WHOI. In solo mode, the HROV will be programmed to follow instructions \u2014 to navigate through a search grid, for example \u2014 and then come back to its mother ship at the surface to deliver recorded data. If it locates something especially interesting, the HROV might be sent down again, tethered, to gather real-time data and respond minute-by-minute to commands from the surface. And it can do all that in a single day, with just one vehicle and one surface ship. Better yet for marine scientists, the HROV will not be limited by depth.  Alvin  can safely reach 4,500 metres below the surface, which still leaves much of the ocean floor beyond its reach. The piloted  Mir  submersibles, owned by Russia, can reach 6,000 metres, as can the French submarine  Nautile . Since the loss of  Kaiko , Japan has continued to explore the depths using its manned  Shinkai 6500  submersible, which can dive to 6,500 metres. The unmanned  Jason II  can also reach that depth. Exploration of the deepest areas, however, must await the advent of the HROV. \u201cThe exciting thing is it should allow us to access areas that cannot be reached by existing manned vehicles,\u201d says Detrick. And there are discoveries to be made down there: when  Kaiko  visited the Challenger Deep, it brought back sediment containing primitive Foraminifera \u2014 single-celled organisms \u2014 that can withstand intense pressure. 1  The only other craft ever to visit the deep was the French-built  Trieste , which carried Swiss scientist Jacques Piccard and the US Navy's John Walsh to the bottom in 1960. But setting extreme-science records is not the HROV's goal, says Susan Humphris, a senior scientist at WHOI. Because of its multiple talents, the submersible will be useful at any depth. \u201cOne aspect I'm interested in is being able to access places we can't reach with current technology, especially in the Arctic,\u201d she says. Remotely operated vehicles generally aren't used in the Arctic for fear that ice might sever the tethering cables and the vehicle be lost. But with the HROV's dual capability, even if its cable is snapped it could still navigate itself back to its entry hole. Because so little is known about the Arctic Ocean, any visit by the submersible is likely to yield important findings, says Humphris. She is particularly interested in scrutinizing the chemistry of Arctic seabed rocks: \u201cThese mantle rocks are the closest analogy we have today to what the whole planet's early materials were like,\u201d she says. Her group is already conducting preliminary experiments to test ideas about what geochemistry the HROV might find once it starts exploring beneath the ice. Compared with other deep-diving submersibles, the HROV should be relatively easy to operate, in part because it won't need a dedicated ship and a large specialized crew to take it out to sea. Instead, all the necessary components will be in a van that can be lifted aboard almost any good-sized ship, with a small crew of dedicated technicians and engineers that will travel with it. The WHOI team aims to keep costs below $10,000 per day, a third to a half as much as  Jason II  costs. To keep costs low, much of the HROV technology will come off the shelf. The thin-walled ceramic spheres that will give the submersible buoyancy, for instance, are an offshoot of technology developed by the US beer company Coors, which worked on ceramics as a way to make better beer filters. And one key advance \u2014 the thin fibre-optic cable that links the HROV to the surface \u2014 was developed by the US Navy for torpedo guidance. The navy is collaborating on the project, as is robotics expert Louis Whitcomb of Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland. \n               Batteries included \n             Unlike  Kaiko , which received electrical power through its tethering cable, the HROV will be powered by onboard batteries. Because the cable serves only as a communications link and not as a power cord, it can be very slender and far more lightweight than  Kaiko 's, for example. To make sure it won't snap, the WHOI team has already tested it by running a live link between a surface ship and the sea floor, says Andrew Bowen, leader of the engineering team. Plans for the vehicle are coming together at WHOI's Deep Submergence Laboratory at the institution's picturesque campus on Cape Cod. Not far from the busy ferry terminal crowded with tourists, engineers cluster in a large, garage-like chamber. Tools, machinery and parts are scattered across the concrete floor. This is where the HROV will be built. But first, the engineers have to decide which new technologies to include. 2  \u201cWe're taking on the high-risk work early on,\u201d says Bowen. For instance, the team is experimenting with low-power light-emitting diodes to illuminate the dark depths. They are also testing different ways of keeping the vehicle buoyant, such as the extraordinarily strong ceramic spheres that use the Coors technology. In the lab, Bowen displays some examples, white balls from 9 to 20 centimetres in diameter. Engineers are trying to decide which size would be best. The spheres are being tested to withstand pressures of 200 megapascals, even though they're expected to encounter only 120 megapascals at the bottom of the Challenger Deep. Such rigorous testing is necessary, Bowen explains, because the HROV can't afford to have a flotation ball break under pressure at depth. \u201cThere is a very real risk,\u201d he says. \u201cIf one implodes, the shock wave could take the whole vehicle out.\u201d Ceramic enclosures \u2014 either spheres or cylinders \u2014 are also being considered to house the HROV's instruments, guidance and electronic systems. Whatever it ends up looking like, the HROV will fill a prominent empty space in oceanography's tool-kit.  Kaiko  may be lost, but soon the HROV will take over its job exploring the deep sea floor. \n                     Deep-sea mission finds life in the Lost City \n                   \n                     Venerable deep-sea sub to be replaced \n                   \n                     Robots in the deep \n                   \n                     HROV home page \n                   \n                     Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Now it seems that those characteristics are caused by rearrangements of large chunks of our DNA \u2014 variations that could be the key to understanding disease. Erika Check investigates. Exactly one year ago this week, scientists announced that they had finished the \u2018Book of Life\u2019. The complete sequence of the human genome had been painstakingly reduced to an ordered list of letters representing the four bases of DNA. This text was believed to be virtually identical for every person on Earth \u2014 and the major differences between individuals, such as hair colour, were said to be the equivalent of typographical errors, no longer than a single letter. The next major task for scientists was to find out which of these tiny differences can cause disease. But even as the ink was drying on the complete sequence, some researchers were questioning whether there was really such a thing as the definitive edition of the Book of Life. By skim-reading individual genomes, these scientists were finding bizarre and unexpected irregularities. In some people, whole paragraphs of the text were duplicated, whereas in others, large passages were missing, or even printed backwards. These major revisions turned up in all kinds of people, including many who seemed healthy and normal. Suddenly, it seemed possible that there was actually no standard version of the Book of Life, and researchers wondered whether we are all much more different from each other than they had thought. Now, scientists are beginning to link these larger variations in the genome to human health and disease. Some even say that the variations explain normal human diversity and evolution, which have always seemed too intricate to be the result of differences in just single DNA bases. \u201cWhen we first looked at the human genome, we were so very proud of being able to look at the definitive sequence,\u201d says genomics researcher Chris Ponting of the University of Oxford, UK. \u201cNow, in just a few years, we've travelled such a long way. We've gone from looking at the human genome to looking at human genomes, plural.\u201d The widespread existence of all these variations is a big surprise because such large changes have been associated with devastating genetic diseases 1 . Deleting a chunk of DNA, for example, can eliminate important genes. Extra copies of a gene can cause overproduction of a protein, throwing the cell's finely balanced biochemistry out of kilter. And moving a DNA chunk from one location to another, or even reversing its orientation, can dramatically change the signals that control genes. So far, most of these variations have not been found to cause overt disease. But researchers now think that they may have a more subtle role to play. They could influence our vulnerability to diseases that are caused by a complex mix of genes and environment. To find out more, two major public projects are cataloguing the extent of these variations in normal humans. One, funded by the US National Institutes of Health, will look for structural variation in the genomes of ten individuals from different ethnic backgrounds. The other, funded by Genome Canada and the UK-based Wellcome Trust, will scan the genome for genetic differences among the 270 people included in the International HapMap Project \u2014 a huge study looking at human genetic diversity. And several private donors are funding projects to find out whether the large variations might cause complex diseases such as cardiovascular problems, Parkinson's, psychiatric disorders and autism. \n               Shock results \n             The pioneering work that spurred these large projects began in 2002. Data were pouring out of the efforts to sequence the human genome, as were tools that allowed scientists to compare DNA from different individuals in incredibly fine detail. At first, researchers were surprised and even disturbed by the new findings. Charles Lee, a cytogeneticist at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, Massachusetts, was investigating whether he could use one of the new technologies as a genetic test. But his experiments kept failing. He frequently found major aberrations in the gene sequences of normal patients he was trying to use in the control group. Some of this group were apparently carrying more copies of certain genes than others, yet they seemed perfectly healthy. Lee was unsure about what was going on until, in late 2003, he went to Canada to give a talk at a meeting in Toronto. There he discovered that Steve Scherer of the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto was seeing the same weird phenomenon: normal, healthy patients with different copy numbers for certain genes. Meanwhile, at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in New York, molecular geneticist Michael Wigler was using a different technology to compare the genomes of two men: a Caucasian and an African pygmy. He also saw copy-number changes where he did not expect them \u2014 in this case, in a gene that codes for a crucial brain chemical. \u201cWe were very excited, and then very afraid,\u201d says Wigler, who was worried that he had discovered a mutation that would predispose one of the men to schizophrenia. But in the next experiment, his group found copy-number changes in a different gene that is active in human sperm. \u201cThat really freaked us out,\u201d Wigler says. Over the next year, his group turned up more examples of the same phenomenon. \u201cIt didn't take us long to realize we were looking at something that was fairly common,\u201d Wigler says. How common, exactly? Last July, Wigler's group reported that it had looked at 20 normal individuals and found 221 places in the genome where those people had different copy numbers of stretches of DNA 2 . Some of these copy-number changes showed up in more than one person, and so qualify as \u2018polymorphisms\u2019 \u2014 shorthand for particular spots in the genome that regularly differ between individuals. In the Book of Life analogy, these polymorphisms represent sections of text where certain paragraphs are repeated different numbers of times in different individuals. About 76 of the variations Wigler's team found were polymorphisms, and each person had about 11 of them in his or her genome 2 . Soon after, Lee and Scherer reported that in a survey of 55 people they had found 255 copy-number variants, 102 of which were polymorphisms 3 . \n               Different strokes \n             But copy-number polymorphisms tell only part of the story. Earlier this year, a team led by Evan Eichler at the University of Washington in Seattle published evidence of rampant changes of a different sort 4 . Eichler's team compared a portion of an individual woman's genome with the \u2018reference\u2019 human genome sequence produced by the Human Genome Project. The team found 297 potential places where DNA had been rearranged in one of the genomes. Some of these rearrangements were insertions or deletions of stretches of DNA. Others were inversions, where a long stretch of sequence had been reversed in one of the genomes. To go back to the Book of Life, these places represent missing or repeated pages, or whole sections of text that read backwards (see graphic, left). \u201cWe can see this whole new world of variation,\u201d Eichler says. \u201cIt's going to give us a fresh view of the comprehensive genome, from the single base-pair differences to the really large variants.\u201d Genome researchers now have a catch-all phrase for the vast array of rearrangements \u2014 including copy-number polymorphisms, inversions, deletions and duplications \u2014 that occur normally in the human genome. They call it structural variation, and have described at least 800 individual variants that, in total, account for about 3.5% of the human genome. And the sheer number of variants seems likely to catch up with the number of known single nucleotide polymorphisms \u2014 the single-letter \u2018typos\u2019 in the Book of Life. That makes structural variation a potentially major source of diversity. It is even possible that we're not all 99.9% similar, as the Human Genome Project predicted. The biggest question about structural variation is: does it matter? There are already some hints that it does. Eichler's analysis this year showed that many of the genes found in structural variants negotiate our interactions with the environment 4 . Some make proteins that break down drugs, for example, or help our immune systems respond to disease. So it makes sense that some of these variations explain our unique responses to the stresses or pleasures of life. \n               Strength in numbers \n             In March, a team headed by Sunil Ahuja at the University of Texas Health Science Center, San Antonio, published a new and dramatic proof of that principle 5 . The researchers analysed the average number of copies of an immune-system gene in African, European, Asian and American populations. They found that extra copies of the gene, which makes an immune-system protein called CCL3L1, helped protect people against HIV. If patients with the extra copies became infected by HIV, they progressed more slowly towards full-blown AIDS than those with fewer copies. There is also good reason to hope that structural variation will shed new light on complex diseases, such as obesity, whose development is triggered by the interaction of many genes, rather than one or two. For one thing, studies such as Eichler's show that structural variation is involved in our response to the environment \u2014 a key factor in complex disease. What's more, statistical analyses show that regions of structural variation contain genes that are still evolving in humans 6 . If these genes are important enough for evolution to be changing them, they must affect us in some way, for better or worse. And if we can't detect these effects immediately, it is possible that regions of structural variation are interacting with other parts of our genomes in subtle ways to influence our most crucial traits. \u201cGiven that everywhere we've looked hard, we've found that copy-number variation influences human disease, it would be strange if complex diseases didn't also appear on that radar,\u201d says evolutionary geneticist Matt Hurles at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute near Cambridge, UK. It's this hope that is propelling the disease studies already under way \u2014 most notably, Cold Spring Harbor's $11-million hunt for copy-number polymorphisms related to autism. But the link between structural variation and natural selection raises perhaps an even more intriguing possibility. Has structural variation created new mutations that have helped to shape human evolution 7 ? \n               Brought to book \n             Eichler has found that copy-number variants often occur in larger blocks of repetitive DNA called segmental duplications 8 . These blocks take up about 5% of the human genome, and occur in the same places in all of our genomes. They also seem to cause trouble. Scientists believe segmental duplications make it difficult for our genome to replicate itself faithfully during the processes that create eggs and sperm. Mistakes result in DNA rearrangements, such as deletions and inversions, meaning that new structural variants are created and passed down the generations. Icelandic scientists reported earlier this year, for instance, that 20% of Europeans carry a large genetic inversion that is spreading throughout the population 9 . Women who carry the inversion have more children than those who don't \u2014 a classic sign that it confers some sort of selective advantage. And studies comparing us with our chimp cousins have already linked structural variation to our divergence from the apes. Last year, scientists from the University of Colorado in Denver and Stanford University found 1,005 genes that differed in copy number among humans and four other primates 10 . This month, Eichler's group reported 651 likely structural rearrangements between chimps and humans 11 . The group counted 245 genes contained in these variants, including some genes involved in reproduction and drug metabolism. Eichler's group has also found that segmental duplications have created much more of our genomic differences from chimps than single base-pair differences 7 . There are 177 genes contained within the human-specific duplications. As such duplications are hotspots for evolution, those 177 genes could be partly responsible for creating the traits that make us human. These genetic differences could also be useful. Scherer's lab has just released a targeted analysis of inversions between the chimp and human genomes 12 . The group found 1,576 probable inversions, and confirmed 23; three of these differed among human individuals. Not only does this shed some light on primate evolution, but as inversions can often predispose DNA to harmful mutations, these inversions might be involved with human disease. \u201cIf you can highlight the structural variations that are inversions, you might be able to highlight where you should look for regions involved in disease,\u201d Scherer says. In other words, those quirky differences written into the pages of the Book of Life are more than just nonsensical scribblings. Those weirdly rearranged sentences may actually portend life or death. Deciphering the meaning of these cryptic passages could help scientists to diagnose, prevent and treat disease \u2014 although that will probably take many years. For now, the realization that we are all reading from individual texts has already altered scientists' understanding of humanity \u2014 and of the library of unique volumes that makes up the human race. \n                     Large genomic differences explain our little quirks \n                   \n                     Human Genome Web Focus \n                   \n                     Chimp genome web focus \n                   \n                     Nature Reviews Genetics Web Focus on repeat instability \n                   \n                     Eichler lab \n                   \n                     Cold Spring Harbor labs \n                   \n                     Variant database \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},
{"file_id": "4371220a", "url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/4371220a", "year": 2005, "authors": [{"name": "Alison Abbott"}], "parsed_as_year": "2006_or_before", "body": "The flailing limbs of someone acting out their dreams in bed may not seem the obvious place to seek a cure for Parkinson's disease. But, as Alison Abbott finds out, this sleep disorder is shedding fresh light on the development of neurodegenerative disorders. Many couples suffer in silence, for fear that the police may be called. But those who make it to the sleep clinic have some bizarre tales to tell. Sleep neurologist Brad Boeve recalls one couple who described a particularly horrendous night-time event. While they slept in their bed, the husband suddenly grabbed his wife's head, shook it around roughly, then slammed it down hard and threw up his arms. Far from being intentional, this distressing episode was the result of a disorder that sees sleeping people physically act out their dreams. In this instance, when the husband woke up he revealed that he had been playing rugby in his dream, had scored a try and then raised his arms in victory. The case is just one of many that Boeve has investigated at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. Beyond the obvious immediate trauma, Boeve believes that the sleep problem could hint at something more sinister. A large proportion of those affected by it go on to develop Parkinson's disease or a closely related neurodegenerative condition. \u201cI get weekly e-mails from people who have had these episodes and are afraid,\u201d says Boeve. The idea that the sleeping problem, known as REM sleep behaviour disorder, or RBD, and Parkinson's could be linked poses difficult ethical questions for doctors. But it could also overturn current theories on how Parkinson's disease works and how it could be treated. There are many sleep disorders, from insomnia to sleep-walking (see  Sleep Insight ), but few are more bizarre and disturbing than RBD in its chronic form. About a quarter of a healthy night's sleep is occupied by rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, snatched in ever lengthening stretches as the night progresses. REM sleep is the time of dreaming, and voluntary muscles \u2014 apart from those of the eyes, which flicker continuously \u2014 become temporarily paralysed. Described as REM atonia, this paralysis stops us from physically acting out our dreams. RBD sufferers lose this atonia. Instead, they flail their limbs and carry out coordinated movements \u2014 like the head-grabbing \u2014 following the course of their dreams. These dreams are always vivid and frequently involve fighting or being chased. Experts believe that the subjects of the dreams are, in turn, influenced by the mobilized limbs whose movements get woven into the stories. \n               Strong link \n             Episodes of RBD may occur only once a year, or as often as four or five times a night. So far, there seems to be no link between the frequency of the episodes and the likelihood of developing a neurodegenerative disease \u2014 or how soon such a disorder might appear. Of the 26 RBD patients studied by neurologists Carlos Schenck and Mark Mahowald at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis, 18 have developed Parkinson's disease or closely related conditions 1 . The degenerative diseases that have been linked to RBD have a common underlying feature. A protein in the brain called \u03b1-synuclein becomes misfolded and clumps together to form aggregates. Collectively, these diseases are called synucleinopathies, although it remains unclear exactly what role the \u03b1-synuclein protein plays in the conditions. RBD patients develop diseases involving misfolded \u03b1-synuclein disturbingly often. Schenck, for example, notes that about 70% of his RBD patients go on to develop a synucleinopathy. In his patients, it took an average of 13 years from the onset of RBD until the patient began to show symptoms of synucleinopathy \u2014 although the range was between 3 and 29 years. Other centres report similar experiences. In unpublished work, Boeve, for example, has studied more than 250 RBD patients, many of whom had Parkinson's disease or another synucleinopathy when they arrived at his sleep clinic. About half of those who showed up with just RBD developed a synucleinopathy an average of eight years later. Tell-tale \u03b1-synuclein aggregates called Lewy bodies were found in the brains of 26 of the 27 patients who died during the study. By the mid-1990s, it was clear that there was probably a connection between RBD and synucleinopathies 2 . But researchers had no idea what might lie behind the link \u2014 anatomically it just didn't add up. A muscle's readiness to contract, or its tone, during REM sleep seems to be controlled by the brain stem, a complex structure that shuttles information between the body and higher areas of the brain. This was demonstrated in the 1960s by sleep researcher Michel Jouvet at the University of Lyon, France. He damaged the pons, part of the brain stem, in cats and found that the animals no longer slept peacefully but would, for example, stalk imaginary prey during REM sleep 3 . But according to scientific dogma, Parkinson's disease results from the death of nerve cells in the substantia nigra, a different region that sits above the brain stem in an area called the midbrain. These nerve cells release a chemical called dopamine, which transmits signals to other parts of the brain and so helps to control movement. The link between Parkinson's and the loss of these cells in the substantia nigra is reasonably well established. Treating Parkinson's patients with dopamine, for example, can dramatically improve their movement control, at least for a while. And autopsies of people with the disease have shown that they had lost at least 80% of their dopamine-producing cells in the substantia nigra. So how can this be reconciled with the apparent correlation between RBD and Parkinson's disease? The small community of scientists researching this field are now wondering whether the dogma needs a rethink. They suspect that RBD is the first sign of a degenerative process that begins in or near the brain stem and then creeps up the brain to other areas. According to this idea, first put forward by Boeve 4 , RBD results from damage to a brain area affected early in the course of a more extensive condition. This disease really cripples only when it hits, and strips, the substantia nigra. However plausible it seems, this idea leaves many questions unanswered. Why, for example, do only two-thirds of Parkinson's patients seem to suffer from RBD \u2014 shouldn't they all? But there is also some compelling support for the concept, particularly from the work of Heiko Braak, a neuroanatomist at the University of Frankfurt in Germany. Braak performed detailed anatomical investigations of 41 autopsy brains from people who had Parkinson's disease. He also looked at 69 brains from people who had no clinical record of neurodegenerative disease but whose autopsies revealed that parts of their brains contained Lewy bodies 5 . \n               Body of evidence \n             Braak showed that the emergence of Lewy bodies seemed to follow a defined and fairly predictable path, which he graded into six distinct steps (see graphic, overleaf). In the least affected brains, the Lewy bodies are confined to distinct areas of the lower brain stem. In stages 3 and 4, damage extends into the upper brain stem. And in stages 5 and 6, the damage reaches the substantia nigra and, ultimately, the cortex, impinging on areas involved in emotional and intellectual activities 5 . The Lewy bodies seem to multiply and spread through the brain, never appearing at higher levels unless they are also present lower in the brain stem. \u201cBy the time you see the distressing motor symptoms of Parkinson's, the damage is well advanced,\u201d says Braak. But because the early stages of this condition don't seem to have any obvious symptoms, it is very difficult for clinicians to correlate Braak's stages with signs of disease. So it is impossible categorically to conclude that the progression of the Lewy bodies has anything to do with Parkinson's. \u201cIt is only a hypothesis, although a plausible one\u201d Braak says. \u201cWe'll have to see if any symptoms are eventually associated with early stages.\u201d His idea certainly resonates with clinician-researcher William Langston, who heads the Parkinson's Institute in Sunnyvale, California. Langston is keenly aware that his patients report all manner of weird symptoms that at the moment are not classified as part of classical Parkinson's. \u201cThere is a ringing association on the clinical side,\u201d he says. \u201cI have a feeling that in Parkinson's disease we may have trouble seeing the forest for the tree \u2014 the tree being the devastating motor effects.\u201d What would it mean if the early stages identified by Braak were indeed relevant to the disease? And what if the march of the Lewy bodies could be tracked in the living brain, for example through unexpected clinical manifestations such as RBD? \u201cThen we could give people advance warning that they were at very high risk for Parkinson's,\u201d says Ilonka Eisensehr, a neurologist now in private practice whose research at the University of Munich has added to the body of evidence linking RBD with synucleinopathies. Eisensehr found that some patients who came to her sleep clinic for reasons unrelated to RBD had some muscle tone during REM sleep. In other words, they no longer had complete sleep paralysis, although they had not yet begun acting out their dreams. She carried out brain imaging studies on a group of these \u2018subclinical\u2019 RBD patients, comparing them with RBD patients, those with Parkinson's disease and healthy controls. She measured levels of proteins called dopamine transporters in the upper brain stem. These proteins are found only on dopamine-producing neurons, giving Eisensehr a way of monitoring the fate of these cells in patients. She saw a clear pattern: the greatest loss of dopamine transporters was in patients with Parkinson's disease, although RBD patients also showed fairly low levels. In the subclinical RBD patients, the transporter level was better but was still lower than than in the healthy controls, and the loss correlated directly with how much muscle tone they had during REM sleep 6 . \u201cLoss of REM atonia could indeed be a measurable, very early indicator for Parkinson's disease,\u201d Eisensehr says. Karin Stiasny-Kolster at the University of Marburg in Germany has taken this further by showing that nearly all of her 30 patients with clinical or subclinical RBD had a badly disturbed sense of smell, a very common complaint among Parkinson's patients 7 . These observations fit well with Braak's hypothesis that Parkinson's progresses up through the brain in distinct stages, says Stiasny-Kolster. Smell signals enter the brain directly in the olfactory bulb, one of the areas, along with the brain stem, that Braak categorizes as stage 1. Despite this evidence, some sleep neurologists have yet to be convinced. One of them is Alex Iranzo at the University of Barcelona in Spain. He says that over the past nine years, 40% of his RBD patients have developed a neurological disease, but in many cases that disorder was not a synucleinopathy. \u201cRBD is certainly an anatomical disease, but I'm not sure there is a simple molecular explanation for it,\u201d Iranzo says. Clearly the phenomenon requires a lot more research to unravel exactly what is going wrong in the brains of those who suffer from RBD. But whatever the outcome, the statistics are stark: these patients have a highly increased risk of developing Parkinson's disease, or another irreversible degenerative disorder. At the moment there are no drugs to protect neurons against the disease, raising the ethical dilemma of whether or not patients should be warned when they are diagnosed with RBD. \n               Policy of truth \n             Like Eisensehr, Schenck thinks they should be. \u201cThen they will stay in touch with clinics and may eventually be able to be recruited into studies testing potential neuroprotective agents,\u201d Schenck says. Many drug companies are trying to develop such drugs, and enrolling people at high risk of developing Parkinson's, but who have no symptoms, into clinical trials could help bring products to the market faster. Recruiting those who already have Parkinson's disease is not ideal as they have already lost a high proportion of their dopamine-producing cells, leaving few neurons to protect. \u201cMost trials have failed because we are not getting in early enough,\u201d says Langston. Jacques Montplaisir, a neurologist at the University of Montreal in Canada, prefers not to bring the issue up with his patients unless one of them specifically asks. He is concerned about needlessly alarming the subgroup of RBD patients who are not suffering from a neurodegenerative disease. Montplaisir tests his RBD patients' sense of smell as well as their ability to discriminate colours, which is also frequently lost in Parkinson's disease, hoping that this will help to identify those who are at high risk. Only at such a point, or when a neuroprotective agent is available, would it be ethically justified to inform patients, he says. \u201cThe best approach is to make clinicians aware of the possible correlation between RBD and Parkinson's, so they will be alert to danger signals such as RBD, and also disturbances to the sense of smell,\u201d says Kieran Breen, director of research at the Parkinson's Disease Society in London. \u201cClinicians could then monitor the patients closely.\u201d But Breen adds that patients should be told they have Parkinson's only when the first motor symptoms start. \u201cIt would not be fair on the patient otherwise,\u201d he says, \u201cgiven the uncertainty of the link and the long time-lag that can sometimes occur between onset of RBD and onset of Parkinson's.\u201d Neurologists currently prescribe clonazepam, a drug used to treat epilepsy, to RBD patients to suppress their dream enactment. But no prescription can help patients live with the fear that a diagnosis of RBD brings. In the future, those with early warning signs may turn out to be the lucky ones if effective neuroprotective agents are developed. \u201cWe are facing a revolution in Parkinson's disease,\u201d says Langston. \u201cWe've been fixated on movement disorder linked to cell death in the substantia nigra, but we may now have to think more broadly.\u201d He believes that early warning signs such as RBD may turn out to be exactly what is needed to understand this terrible disease and learn how to stop it in its tracks. \n                     Registry could nail causes of Parkinson's \n                   \n                     Nature Medicine Neurodegeneration Web Focus \n                   \n                     Mayo Clinic \n                   \n                     Parkinson's disease Society \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Helen Pilcher gets on the trail of the anammox bacterium. When the good citizens of Delft complained about the smell wafting from the local yeast factory, they had no idea they had initiated the discovery of rocket-fuel-filled bacteria that would mystify microbiologists and force a rewrite of the biology textbooks. The microbes, known as anammox bacteria, are full of surprises. They flout bacterial convention by having tiny, sac-like compartments. They defy common sense by packing these sacs with toxic hydrazine. And they are helping to resolve a long-standing conundrum about where much of the ocean's ammonia goes. Not content with this, the brightly coloured bacteria are paving the way for environmentally friendly sewage treatments. The Gist-Brocades yeast factory, situated in the middle of Delft in the Netherlands, was unpopular with the locals because it produced a lot of eggy-smelling, sulphide-rich waste. To keep its neighbours sweet, the company devised an odourless process, breaking down the effluent in sealed, oxygen-free tanks. The pilot plant built in the mid-1980s worked, and sulphide levels fell. But as the residents breathed a sigh of relief, workers at the plant noticed something odd. Dogma had it that ammonia needed oxygen to be broken down so the engineers expected the concentration of that compound in the tank to stay constant. But a few months later, ammonia levels were falling and nitrogen gas was being produced. Intrigued, the company contacted microbiologist Gijs Kuenen at Delft University of Technology. Kuenen suspected that anaerobic bacteria were at work, combining ammonia with nitrite to form nitrogen gas and water. The idea that bacteria could use an anaerobic ammonium oxidation or anammox reaction had been proposed some ten years earlier 1 , but most microbiologists were sceptical \u2014 no such bacteria had ever been found and the reaction had never been seen occurring naturally. Kuenen realized that the mysterious Delft bacteria might offer a new method for wastewater treatment and, if found elsewhere, could be important in nature. He decided to investigate 2 . \u201cIt was a brave move,\u201d says his former PhD student Marc Strous, now at Radboud University in Nijmegen, the Netherlands. \u201cKuenen began to study something that all his colleagues thought didn't exist.\u201d \n               Vigorous hybrid \n             Electron microscopy helped to nail the suspect. A close look revealed microbes that housed a strange, internal, membrane-bound compartment. This was a big surprise, because only more complex, or \u2018eukaryotic\u2019, cells such as our own are supposed to have such compartments, called organelles. Simpler \u2018prokaryotic\u2019 cells, including bacteria, should lack them. Only one kind of bacterium, the planctomycetes, was then known to play host to such a structure, and it turned out the microbes belonged to this phylum. Planctomycetes are peculiar because they contain features from all three domains of life \u2014 bacteria, eukaryotes and archaea \u2014 and some think they may represent an early common ancestor. DNA studies place them firmly in the bacterial camp. But their internal organelles make them resemble eukaryotes. And the microbes lack the rigid polymer peptidoglycan in their cell walls, making them similar to members of the single-celled archaea domain. \u201cThey blur the definition of what bacteria are,\u201d says Strous. Planctomycetes were not known to perform the anammox reaction, but Kuenen's team incubated the Delft cells with ammonium and nitrite, and watched the ingredients disappear 3 . Genetic analysis confirmed the microbes' group and they were provisionally named  Brocadia anammoxidans ;  anammoxidans  for their unique biochemistry, and  Brocadia  for their place of discovery and because the bright red bacteria reminded the researchers of gaudy brocade fabric. In the wake of this paper, colleagues' opinions changed overnight. \u201cThis was a real turning point,\u201d says microbiologist Mike Jetten, also from Radboud University, who contributed to the work. Before the paper, the majority of microbiologists did not believe that anammox occurred. After it, the theory gained widespread acceptance and anammox bacteria took their rightful place in Earth's nitrogen cycle. The nitrogen cycle converts stable nitrogen gas into more usable forms, such as ammonia and nitrate ions, and back again, maintaining a global balance (see graphic). Nitrogen gas is converted directly to ammonia by nitrogen-fixing microbes, such as those associated with certain plant roots in the soil. Plants and animals consume ammonia, which is released when they die and decompose. The next step is the nitrifying bacteria and archaea, which transform ammonia to nitrites and nitrates, and the cycle is completed as denitrifying microorganisms convert nitrates into nitrogen gas, replenishing the atmosphere. Anammox takes a short cut through the cycle, creating a path from ammonia and nitrite directly to nitrogen gas. The fact that these bacteria pull off such a stunt is remarkable enough. But when researchers investigated how they did it, there were even more surprises. Findings suggested that the anammox reaction occurring inside the membrane-bound bag, or anammoxosome, produced hydrazine as an intermediate 4 . Why would bacteria produce hydrazine \u2014 a potent rocket fuel? The explosive molecule isn't found anywhere else in nature. \u201cWe were still puzzled as to what was going on,\u201d says Jetten. \n               Toxic cargo \n             It may be that the high-energy hydrazine is needed to drive the anammox reaction. But this does not explain how the bacteria manage their toxic load without killing themselves. Hydrazine can easily diffuse through cell membranes, so Jetten suspected that the anammoxosome membrane must be unusual and in some way able to contain the dangerous load. He contacted lipid expert Jaap Sinninghe Damst\u00e9 from the Royal Netherlands Institute for Sea Research in Texel and they analysed the organelle's membrane. What they found was extraordinary 5 . \u201cWe showed it to organic chemists at the University of Amsterdam and they said it was impossible,\u201d says Damst\u00e9. The membrane's lipids are made of five carbon-based rings fused together to form a dense ladder. This \u2018ladderane\u2019 lipid is peculiar because it has a lot of energy built into it and is very unstable. It is thought the structure makes the membrane exceptionally dense, and so stops hydrazine leaking into the rest of the cell. \u201cIt's a complete mystery how nature makes this lipid,\u201d says organic chemist and Nobel laureate Elias Corey from Harvard University, who has made the structure in the laboratory. Researchers are now unravelling the bacterium's genome to work out how it does it. The Dutch team, which has patented the production process for the lipid, hopes that the microelectronics industry will find a use for the impenetrable membrane. The most pragmatic application of anammox bacteria lies in wastewater treatment. Sewage plants and industrial processes, such as fertilizer manufacture and petroleum refining, generate millions of litres of ammonia-rich waste, all of which needs to be broken down. Conventional methods use nitrifying bacteria to convert ammonia into nitrite and nitrate, and then denitrifying bacteria to yield nitrogen gas. The microbes need oxygen, so huge, electricity-gobbling machines are needed to aerate the sludge. And the denitrifying bacteria need an energy source, such as methanol, which they burn to produce carbon dioxide. The process is costly, takes up a lot of space and is unkind to the environment. Anammox wastewater plants offer major advantages. Anammox bacteria use ammonia as their fuel \u2014 there's no need for expensive methanol. They do not need oxygen, so the process uses less electricity. And instead of producing carbon dioxide, anammox bacteria consume it, so the method is environmentally friendly. Altogether, this leads to a 90% reduction in operational costs and a 50% reduction in space, compared with conventional methods. The Dutch company Paques, based in Balk, has developed the first anammox reactor. The prototype has been set up as part of a municipal wastewater treatment plant in Rotterdam and is performing well. It is likely that anammox will become an important part of wastewater treatment, but its role in the wider world is potentially far greater. Oceanographers looking into anammox reasoned that if the reaction went on in anoxic water tanks, it might also occur in oxygen-poor parts of the sea where it could contribute to the oceanic nitrogen cycle. If that were the case, it would solve a 40-year-old marine mystery. In the mid-1960s, Francis Richards from the University of Washington in Seattle noted that ammonia was inexplicably missing in an anoxic fjord 6 . He proposed that it must be being oxidized anaerobically to nitrogen gas, either inorganically or by some unknown microbe. At the time, oceanographers found the idea preposterous. But in December 2001, biogeochemist Marcel Kuypers from the Max Planck Institute for Marine Microbiology in Bremen, Germany, and his colleagues went fishing for anammox bacteria in the Black Sea \u2014 the biggest anoxic basin in the world. The team drew samples from between 85 and 100 metres down, where oxygen is absent and ammonia is found only in trace amounts. As suspected, anammox bacteria were present \u2014 the first time they had ever been found in the sea 7 .The microbes are incredibly efficient, and it is thought that anammox bacteria may account for up to half of all the nitrogen production in the world's oceans 8 , 9 . This is forcing a major rethink of the global nitrogen cycle and slowly persuading oceanographers that denitrifying bacteria are not the only microbes responsible for nitrogen production. As acceptance of anammox bacteria grows, so too does their grip on the planet. The microbes are turning up everywhere \u2014 in fresh and salt water, open oceans and marine sediments, and in wastewater treatment plants all over the world. \u201cOne day you discover a bug,\u201d says Kuenen, \u201cthen ten years later they turn out to be everywhere and important on a global scale. They may even be hiding in the sewer system under your kitchen sink.\u201d \n                     Magnetic bugs cut sewage sludge \n                   \n                     All at sea \n                   \n                     Nature bio-oceanography insight \n                   \n                     Ocean Genomics web focus \n                   \n                     Anammox online resource \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Geoff Brumfiel discovers some of the payoffs, and perils, of being a fiercely independent researcher. Lawrence Crum thought the experiment was cute; Seth Putterman thought it was miraculous. The year was 1989, and Putterman, a theoretical physicist at the University of California, Los Angeles, (UCLA) was visiting Crum's laboratory at the University of Mississippi in Oxford. One of Crum's graduate students, Felipe Gaitan, was exploring an unusual phenomenon: the creation of light from sound. He began with a glass cylinder filled with a water and glycerine mixture. By vibrating the cylinder at a low frequency, he could create a single bubble that would rhythmically expand and collapse, releasing a tiny flash of light as it did so. Putterman took one look at a video recording of the flashing bubble suspended in the tube and became feverish. \u201cYou shouldn't be able to do it,\u201d he remembers thinking. \u201cThe energy of a piece of sound is 12 orders of magnitude smaller than the energy of a piece of light.\u201d Putterman begged Crum to carry out more experiments on the little bubble. How did it form? Why was it so stable? Where did the energy for those light flashes come from? But Crum had other priorities, not least securing adequate funding for the 150 people then working on physical acoustics in Mississippi. The technical term for what Crum's graduate student had seen was sonoluminescence, and it was nothing new \u2014 physicists had known about it for at least 60 years. In 1989 sonoluminescence was not a particularly hot topic. Crum shrugged off Putterman's interest, saying if he wanted to study the little flashing bubble, he was welcome to go ahead and try. Theoretical physicists spend most of their time at their desks, so perhaps Crum didn't expect Putterman to take up the offer. But back in California the theorist quickly set up his own experiment to recreate the Mississippi effect. He then followed a recipe that has often served him well since: he used precise instrumentation to characterize the phenomenon in detail, and applied a theoretical understanding that was strong enough to challenge popular models of the time. Within two years Putterman had some surprising results 1 . The inside of the bubble was imploding faster than anyone had thought, and the temperature at its core seemed shockingly high \u2014 perhaps five times that of the surface of the Sun. Overnight, sonoluminescence became a cottage industry in the world of acoustical physics. Everyone wanted to know what made it tick. Now 59 years old, Putterman is tall and skinny with a deep Californian tan and a shock of bright, silver hair. Among friends and foes alike, he is known for his love of physics, his penchant for controversy, and his fierce independence. In an era when much of physics advances through the cooperative efforts of hundreds of researchers, Putterman is a lone figure willing to study any phenomenon, no matter how obscure, and ready to publicly take on his critics, no matter how impolitic. \n               Bright spark \n             Aside from physics, Putterman loves good wine, and over a bottle of 2001 Killibinbin Shiraz, he recalls his beginnings in science. From an early age, he found himself gravitating towards physics; he studied the subject first at Cooper Union in New York, and later at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) in Pasadena, where he completed his undergraduate degree in 1966. Even in those early days, Putterman was unafraid to snub convention. His first grant proposal was drafted to support his love for wine-tasting, not physics. Under the 1958 National Defense Education Act, which encouraged US students to pursue careers in science, Putterman was eligible for a low-interest loan. The government was persuaded by Putterman's argument that although he was sure he wanted to embark on a career in physics, he felt a hobby would help keep him going. \u201cCaltech was very supportive of my proposal,\u201d Putterman recalls. \u201cI got US$2,000, which went a long way to buying great Bordeauxs like a 1959 Lafite and 1959 Yquem!\u201d After graduating from Caltech, Putterman returned to New York City to attend Rockefeller University, where he studied under George Uhlenbeck, who together with Samuel Goudsmit, discovered electron spin in 1925. Uhlenbeck was a kindred spirit, a man who loved physics and had little patience for the politics of the field. \u201cHe had no concern about what was or wasn't the official frontier of physics,\u201d Putterman reflects. \n               Burst bubble \n             But his adviser could also be intimidating. On Saturday mornings, Putterman would often find Uhlenbeck in his office, smoking a cigar and meditating in a large leather-backed chair. \u201cI would tell him some scientific insight I'd had in the last week, and he would go over it, see what it meant, formulate it, work with it, attack it \u2014 but he'd be enjoying it the whole time,\u201d Putterman says. Putterman cherishes his cloistered days at Rockefeller University, but admits that they left him unprepared for the realities of modern science. \u201cI was totally sheltered at the Rockefeller,\u201d he says. The faculty didn't have to get funding, and Uhlenbeck never discussed university politics with him. But at least Rockefeller gave him the strength and independence to pursue his own interests, he says. He never worries about \u2018frontier science\u2019, as he calls it, even asking his students to replicate a 300-year-old experiment whose results were never explained. In the case of sonoluminescence, this strategy propelled Putterman to celebrity status. But it has also led his critics to accuse him of profiting from recycled ideas. \u201cOn a grant proposal I once wrote, I was accused of being a used-car salesman,\u201d he says with a chuckle. \u201cBut I think there's just wonderful stuff in the old literature waiting to be exploited with modern instrumentation.\u201d Putterman also likes a good fight, and he is never afraid to publicly take on his critics. \u201cHe is sure of himself, enthusiastic, smart, thinks fast on his feet \u2014 and he can be abrasive as hell,\u201d says Kenneth Suslick, a chemist at the University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign. Putterman has clashed repeatedly with other scientists over interpretations of his first sonoluminescence experiments. Putterman firmly believes that the flash at the centre of the bubble is created by electrons being shaken out of their atomic orbits, whereas his opponents suspect more conventional chemistry is the culprit. The debate has turned so acrimonious that some of his opponents refused to speak to  Nature  for this article. Although Putterman is upset by some of the personal disputes that his work has sparked, overall he remains unfazed by funding difficulties and academic controversy. And true to form, earlier this year, his latest experiments 2  landed him in the centre of another political tussle. In his lab at UCLA, Putterman shows off his latest marvel, a crystal just a few centimetres long; when the crystal is heated, an enormous electric charge builds up on its surface. Like so many of the phenomena studied by Putterman, this type of crystal is not new \u2014 it was first described by the Greek philosopher Theophrastus in 314  BC . But Putterman is the first to exploit its properties for nuclear fusion. Putterman is using the crystal's electric field to catapult hydrogen ions onto a hydrogen-filled target. The result is the fusion of nuclei, which produces helium, and a flurry of neutrons. What is surprising is that this tabletop experiment generates the sort of fusion event that usually requires heavy-duty particle accelerators. \n               Desktop fusion \n             The problem with reports of tabletop fusion is that for most scientists they evoke memories of the notorious, and now largely discredited, \u2018cold fusion\u2019 claim made by two chemists in 1989. The chemists claimed they could achieve nuclear fusion reactions well below the extreme temperatures predicted by theorists, and that these reactions could be used as a source of unlimited energy. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the press were quick to label Putterman's recent findings using the crystal 2  as \u2018cold fusion\u2019. Many scientists might have been horrified to have their research mischaracterized in this way, but Putterman was unperturbed by the controversy, and even enjoyed it. \u201cIf people think this is a crackpot paper that's just fine,\u201d he told  Nature  at the time of his group's announcement. \u201cWe're right.\u201d In the end, researchers found Putterman's measurements of the fusion reactions convincing, and Putterman is now planning to develop commercial and medical applications of his work. Despite turning 60 this year, it seems unlikely that Putterman will narrow his eclectic pursuit of physics. These days, some of his students are attempting to back up the unconfirmed claim that sonoluminescent bubbles are powerful enough to be used as a form of tabletop \u2018bubble fusion\u2019 3 . Another team is starting to make precise measurements related to the randomness inherent in quantum mechanics. It's an area that has long tickled his fancy, although he knows little about it. During his long career, Putterman has picked up no society awards, and funding has often been tight, but he continues to be driven by the challenge of science itself. \u201cI don't do physics with the goal of scoring grant money or proving myself; I do it for the fun of learning something new,\u201d he reflects. \n                     Crystal creates table-top fusion \n                   \n                     Physicists look to crystal device for future of fusion \n                   \n                     US review rekindles cold fusion debate \n                   \n                     Nuclear flash in a pan \n                   \n                     Flash, bang bubble \n                   \n                     Spontaneous energy focusing in fluids and solids \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},
{"file_id": "438014a", "url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/438014a", "year": 2005, "authors": [{"name": "Dan Jones"}], "parsed_as_year": "2006_or_before", "body": "Living things from bacteria to humans change their environment, but the consequences for evolution and ecology are only now being understood, or so the \u2018niche constructivists\u2019 claim.  Dan Jones  investigates. In the Negev Desert of Israel, small organisms can have a big impact. Take the cyanobacteria that live in the soil. Some species secrete sugary substances that form a crust of sand and soil, protecting the bacterial colonies from the effects of erosion. When the rains come, the crusty patches divert water into pools in which wind-borne seeds can germinate. These plants in turn make the soil more hospitable for other plants. Thanks in part to these bacteria, patches of vegetation can be found where they might not otherwise exist. The action of the bacteria, together with local climate change, could lead to the greening of large parts of the desert. The Negev cyanobacteria, and organisms like them, are also having an impact on evolutionary biologists these days. Examples of creatures altering their environment abound \u2014 from beavers that dam streams and earthworms that enrich the soil to humans who irrigate deserts. But too little attention has been given to the consequences of this, say advocates of niche construction.This emerging view in biology stresses that organisms not only adapt to their environments, but also in part create them. The knock-on effects of this interplay between organism and environment, say niche constructivists, have generally been neglected in evolutionary models. Despite pointed criticism from some prominent biologists, niche construction has been winning converts. \u201cWhat we're saying is not only novel, but also slightly disturbing,\u201d says Kevin Laland, an evolutionary biologist at the University of St Andrews in Fife, UK, and one of the authors of the idea 1 . \u201cIf we're right, it requires rethinking evolution.\u201d The conventional view of evolution sees natural selection as shaping organisms to fit their environment. Niche construction, by contrast, accords the organism a much stronger role in generating a fit by recognizing the innumerable ways in which living things alter their world to suit their needs. From this perspective, the road between organism and environment is very much a two-way street. The intellectual stirrings of niche construction date back to the early 1980s, when Harvard University geneticist Richard Lewontin turned to differential equations \u2014 stock in trade for population biologists \u2014 to look at evolution from two different perspectives 2 . He created one set of equations to describe the conventional view of evolution, the one-way-street version. A second set of equations, which he felt better described real evolutionary processes, depicted evolution as a continual feedback loop, in which organisms both adapt to their environments and alter them in ways that generate new selective pressures. Although Lewontin's equations provided a broad perspective rather than a detailed model, he helped to kick-start the niche-constructivist approach, says Laland. \u201cHe really put the idea on the map.\u201d \n               Sons of soil \n             But it has taken years for biologists to begin to incorporate niche construction into more detailed models of evolution and ecology, in part because organism\u2013environment interactions can be so complex. Earthworms, for instance, not only aerate the soil by tunnelling, as any gardener knows, but they also alter its chemical composition by removing calcium carbonate, adding their mucus and excrement, and pulling leaves down into the soil to decay. All of this produces a more favourable environment for worms to live in. Yet classical evolutionary models have typically failed to consider how this transformation alters the selective pressures on the worms and other soil inhabitants, say niche-construction advocates. Back in the Negev Desert there are further examples of dramatic niche construction. At least three species of snail feed on lichens that live just below the surface of porous rocks. To get at the lichens, the snails have to literally eat through the rock, which they then excrete, creating soil around the rock in the process. This might sound insignificant, but it has been calculated that the combined action of these snails could generate enough soil to affect the whole desert ecosystem 3 . By transferring nitrogen in rocks to the soil, where plants use it for growth, the snails contribute substantially to sustaining local biodiversity. \n               Bigger picture \n             In extreme cases, niche-constructing activities can affect the whole world. The classic example from early evolutionary history is that of oxygen-producing cyanobacteria, which helped to set the stage for the evolution of animals and plants. Today, niche construction by human threatens to affect practically all life, as we pump large amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Critics are quick to point out that such cases have been well known to biologists for some time. \u201cDarwin realized that organisms can change their environments in ways that affect their own evolution,\u201d says Laurent Keller, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Lausanne in Switzerland. \u201cThere are already many cases of niche construction by animals and especially humans,\u201d he says. But advocates of niche construction counter that previous attempts to include these effects in evolutionary models have not gone nearly far enough. \u201cPeople hadn't thought through the consequences of these effects, either for evolution or ecology,\u201d says John Odling-Smee, a biological anthropologist at the University of Oxford, UK. To encourage people to consider the issue, Odling-Smee and Laland have taken a two-pronged approach. First, they have catalogued hundreds of examples, involving thousands of species such as the Negev Desert organisms, to drive home the point that niche construction is a widespread phenomenon. In addition, they have developed mathematical models that capture the bidirectional nature of the niche-constructivist view, to show how these processes can actually be modelled. Traditional ecological models typically distinguish between living things and their physical environment, but it is hard to model both elements at the same time. To find a way around this, Laland and Odling-Smee teamed up with Marcus Feldman, an evolutionary biologist and mathematical modeller at Stanford University in California. They found that they could look at niche construction by treating both living and non-living components of a niche as environmental factors that are both affected by, and feed back to, all the organisms in the ecosystem. They presented their results in a 2003 book 1 , whose purpose, they say, was in part to convince other scientists to take niche construction into account in their research. Perhaps the most direct way an organism can alter the challenges it must face is by selecting where it lives, says Robert Holt, an ecologist at the University of Florida in Gainesville. Such habitat selection defines the future context for the evolution of the new residents and their progeny. By choosing to live in places to which they are already adapted, organisms can short-circuit the selective forces that ordinarily lead to evolutionary change. In this way, habitat selection can lead to niche conservatism, which is the tendency not to adapt to new environments, and may explain the evolutionary stasis often seen in the fossil record. Organisms can also shape their interaction with the world in more subtle ways. Developmental biologists know, for instance, that the mature form of many organisms varies depending on the environment in which they grow up. This is known as phenotypic plasticity. Although some creatures, such as beavers and cyanobacteria, alter their environment directly, others niche construct by modifying themselves, says Sonia Sultan, a botanist at Wesleyan University in Middletown, Connecticut. Sultan defines a niche according to the way an organism experiences the world \u2014 its niche is the sum of its experiences, rather than its immediate physical surroundings. Some plants, for example, can grow smaller or larger leaves, depending on whether they happen to be growing in a sunny or shady spot. So this is a form of niche construction, claims Sultan, because the plant is altering its own experience of sunlight. Although phenotypic plasticity has been well studied by a number of researchers, it has yet to be incorporated into the core of evolutionary theory. \u201cNiche construction weaves together a number of themes in ecology and evolution that have typically been studied in isolation,\u201d Sultan says. Rethinking evolution in light of plasticity and other issues raised by niche construction could contribute to an updating of evolutionary theory, Sultan suggests. An update is precisely what Laland and his colleagues have proposed in what they have dubbed extended evolutionary theory. In classical theory, genetic inheritance is the only link through time between generations. Niche construction requires that a second form of inheritance, termed ecological inheritance, be taken into account. \n               Inherit the earth \n             According to this view, many of the physical features that a creature encounters, and the kinds of problem it has to solve, are inherited from the activities of the previous generation. Forest fires, for example, which help to distribute the seeds of some plant species, might be thought to rely solely on the chance of a lightning strike. But the plants in the forest can themselves increase the odds of a fire by secreting flammable oils and retaining dry dead wood in the canopy 4 . Similarly, every earthworm inherits an environment more suited to its lifestyle thanks to the activities of its forebears. Ecological inheritance means that the effects of genes on the environment are, a little like the genes, passed down through the generations. The notion that genes reach beyond the bounds of the organism is often referred to as the \u2018extended phenotype\u2019, a term coined by Richard Dawkins, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Oxford, in his 1982 book of the same name. So it might come as something of a surprise that Dawkins has written a highly critical commentary accusing niche constructivists of a serious conceptual blunder 5 . \n               Dam fools \n             Dawkins's classic example of an extended phenotype is the beaver dam. These remarkable structures dramatically alter the surrounding ecosystem. Trees are felled to make the dam, which in turn floods the area, providing a new environment for species from frogs to fish. If the beaver's footprint on its environment is viewed as an example of ecological inheritance, it would seem that the extended phenotype and niche construction should make natural bedfellows. But guess again. Although Dawkins says he recognizes the importance of organism-induced effects on the world, he believes that niche construction conflates two distinct kinds of effects. Dam-building certainly counts as an organism engineering its environment, he says, but other effects, such as the oxygenation of the atmosphere by cyanobacteria, are mere coincidental by-products of life. These types of effects, which Dawkins calls niche changing, are too loosely connected to the success of the organisms that cause them to count as genuine niche construction. Dawkins is not alone in this view. Kim Sterelny, a philosopher of biology at the Victoria University of Wellington, New Zealand, says that niche construction \u201clumps too many things together\u201d. This matters, because the two kinds of effects, construction versus mere changing, generate different feedback loops between the organism and the environment, which can lead to different evolutionary dynamics, Sterelny says. Laland says he is sympathetic to the distinction, but is concerned that the term \u2018mere\u2019 associated with \u2018niche changing\u2019 downplays its evolutionary importance. For Laland, niche changing is as important to evolution as beaver-like niche construction. When you get down to doing the models it often doesn't help much to make the distinction, says Laland. The effects of organisms can have evolutionary consequences regardless of whether they are produced by adaptations. Although the philosophical debates continue, other researchers are busily incorporating the ideas of niche construction into their work. Sultan, for instance, finds the concept useful in thinking about invasive species, whose potentially destructive power is a key issue in conservation biology. Invasive species, such as weeds, often experience a time lag between arriving in a new niche and colonizing it. It may take a while for successful genetic variants of the invader to arise and spread, for instance. But if a species arrives that has sufficient phenotypic plasticity to thrive in the new environment, the take-over might be much more rapid. Sultan believes that explicitly adopting niche-constructivist views on phenotypic plasticity could help scientists to devise appropriate strategies for combating conservation problems: it could give them, for example, more accurate tools for projecting the rate of spread of an invasive plant. Others are pioneering ways to study perhaps the ultimate niche constructors \u2014 us. In many obvious ways, humans have utterly transformed otherwise inhospitable parts of the world to suit our needs, from ranks of houses in the desert to skyscrapers. Perhaps a less obvious example of niche construction is human culture. Culture itself can be seen as a niche that we inhabit, and just as we shape our culture, our culture shapes us. One example of this is the emergence over several thousand years of lactose tolerance in European adults, which has followed the cultural practice of drinking cow's milk 6 . \n               Culture club \n             Now a number of anthropologists are scrutinizing how culture can put selective pressure on our genetic make-up. In the past, many have been reluctant to tackle such questions, in part because of fears of being associated with genetic determinism, but also because of the daunting mathematics of modelling gene\u2013culture interactions. But that seems to be changing, says Joe Henrich, an anthropologist at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia. \u201cThe study of cultural evolution is expanding rapidly within scientific anthropology,\u201d he says. One of the hottest areas at the moment is the puzzle of human sociality \u2014 why we are so often willing to cooperate with unrelated people, even when it is not in our immediate self-interest 7 . Whether or not genes promoting sociality flourish depends in part on the social environment in which they find themselves, which in turn is affected by culture. \u201cWe have shown that culture can evolve to change the selective environment faced by genes favouring cooperation. This opens up a whole evolutionary vista unavailable to non-cultural species,\u201d says Henrich. Niche-construction advocates are passionate about their new view of ecological and evolutionary processes, whether they study bacteria or humans, but it is too soon to say whether the approach will yield insights that might otherwise have been missed. Still, Laland fully accepts the challenge. \u201cThe onus is on us to show that this is going to be useful,\u201d he says. \n                     Changing the world \n                   \n                     Causing a commotion \n                   \n                     Kevin Laland's niche construction page \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Now he is applying the lessons he learned in business to the conservation of fish stocks. Rex Dalton reports. When George Sugihara was seduced by German bankers, he was wooed with style. He was whisked from his San Diego lab to a swanky London hotel, where his room came with a personal butler. Then it was on to a country estate stocked with the finest food and wines. His suitor was a senior executive with Deutsche Bank, one of the world's leading financial firms. One night, with a Cuban cigar in hand, the banker wrote ever-increasing monetary offers on a napkin. \u201cIt was remarkable,\u201d Sugihara recalls. By the mid-1990s, banks and investment houses had realized that academics skilled in mathematical modelling could help them to devise winning strategies with which to play the world's financial markets. Sugihara, who had built a formidable reputation among ecologists by analysing the population dynamics of fish and plankton, was a prize catch. Deutsche Bank wanted him to apply those talents to its \u2018black-box project\u2019, a secret endeavour designed to predict the prices of various financial instruments. Sugihara struck a hard bargain. In addition to providing an ample salary, Deutsche Bank agreed to let him stay in San Diego \u2014 where the Frankfurt-based firm provided a posh office complex overlooking the harbour. There, it gave him all the resources he needed to devise models to decipher price trends from masses of financial data. In 1995, when Sugihara took leave of absence from the University of California, San Diego (UCSD), his colleagues thought it unlikely that he would ever return \u2014 few scientists who have been seduced by the world of finance have later resumed their academic careers. But Sugihara has bucked that trend, and is now applying his experience in finance to marine conservation. He wants to harness market forces to prevent over-fishing \u2014 which governments and the scientists who advise them have mostly so far failed to achieve. In reality, Sugihara never turned his back on biological oceanography. During his four years with Deutsche Bank, he taught part-time at UCSD, and published more than a dozen scientific articles on complex biological systems. When his leave period was up, he says, hard science was always going to win over high finance. \u201cNo, it wasn't hard to leave that world,\u201d he says. \u201cI really wanted to do science.\u201d But Sugihara's experience of the markets has changed the way he thinks about managing the ocean's natural resources. For decades, investors have traded on markets for the future prices of virtually every commodity, from grain crops, through orange juice, to oil. Yet despite worldwide sales of at least US$80 billion a year, there is no futures market for fish. Sugihara hopes to change that. By providing people with the means to make money, and offering a structured financial environment for the worldwide catch and sale of fish, he argues, it should be possible to prevent stock depletion. \n               Trading places \n             To this end, Sugihara and a number of scientific colleagues are now seeking start-up finance for a company called the Ocean Resource Exchange. This would trade and lease financial instruments or derivatives associated with fish catches, on an electronic commodities exchange. Perhaps trading is in Sugihara's genes. His Japanese father was a trader in wood products, who settled in California in 1951 with his Indonesian wife and young son, seeking new opportunities away from the turmoil of post-war Asia. But the young Sugihara didn't follow his father into business. After graduating from the University of Michigan in 1973, he embarked on an academic career, initially studying lake cores in Africa. First he worked in Zambia, where he identified pollens and diatoms for palaeoclimate studies. Later, he moved to Tunisia to study algal productivity and the origins of hydrogen sulphide emissions from Lake Tunis. Sugihara's analytical mind found this fieldwork unsatisfying, so he returned to Michigan to bone up on mathematics. \u201cI took 26 courses in two years,\u201d he says. And with his growing mathematical sophistication, he developed a theory to explain an observed regularity in the distribution of species abundance 1 . When he approached Robert May, then conducting pioneering analyses of biodiversity at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, with the theory, May immediately recognized Sugihara's potential \u2014 and signed him up as a doctoral student. By the time Sugihara completed his PhD in 1982, he already had his eyes on UCSD's Scripps Institution of Oceanography, which hosted a largely untapped repository of oceanographic and fisheries data. \u201cThis was a gold mine,\u201d says Sugihara. \u201cAnd no one was looking at it intensively.\u201d At Scripps, Sugihara used these data to develop and test mathematical models designed to probe the dynamics of complex biological systems. Among the results was an influential article published with May, which showed how to use nonlinear equations \u2014 formulas where output isn't proportional to input \u2014 to make short-term predictions about the behaviour of chaotic systems such as the population dynamics of marine plankton 2 . \n               Trend setter \n             Among those who recognized the equations' power was former behavioural ecologist Steven Schulman, who knew Sugihara from Princeton. By 1990, Schulman was in the New York office of the financial firm Merrill Lynch, conducting quantitative analyses to reduce investment risk. In Sugihara's equations, Schulman saw the possibility of predicting prices in market derivatives. So he brokered a consulting deal: Merrill Lynch provided Sugihara with financial data, which he mined for price trends. For Sugihara, it was a dream. First, the arrangement allowed him to put his own finances on a sounder footing. \u201cI couldn't afford to send my children to college, back then,\u201d he says. Analysing the markets also presented him with fresh intellectual challenges. \u201cI'm driven by access to data,\u201d he says. Then, in 1995, came the extravagant courtship by Robert Stein, then the head of Deutsche Bank's Japanese office. Confidentiality agreements prevent Sugihara from discussing details of his work for the bank. \u201cBasically, I modelled the fear and greed of mobs that trade,\u201d he says. And at the time, Sugihara was even more discreet, telling acquaintances who asked about his work: \u201cI'm a teacher.\u201d Former colleagues who visited didn't know what to make of his new life as a financial sleuth. Sugihara recalls the first time that May dropped by at his harbour-side office and assumed he was the victim of an elaborate practical joke. \u201cHe opened a desk drawer to look for something with my name on it,\u201d Sugihara says. Sugihara's earnings in the world of finance have provided a home with an enviable sea view, plus a vintage Porsche parked in the garage. But by the standards of banking high-fliers, these are limited extravagances. For Sugihara, acquiring wealth was never the main goal, so he had few qualms about getting back on the treadmill of winning grants for his research. That's not always easy for someone who cuts across disciplines, and whose ideas are often ahead of their time. \u201cIt's too far out of the box\u201d is a common comment from reviewers, Sugihara observes. But unlike his colleagues, whose grant applications get tossed aside, Sugihara has the luxury of being able to support some of his own research, using a trust fund set up during his Deutsche Bank days. In part, that was how he funded his latest work, an analysis of environmental fluctuations and ecological catastrophes in the North Pacific 3 . This suggests that fishing quotas may need to be set more conservatively, and adjusted more frequently to compensate for environmental conditions, than is typically the case. \u201cThe way fish quotas are set is wrong,\u201d says Sugihara. \u201cIt doesn't fit nature or reality.\u201d \n               Net gains \n             The National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), which sets quotas in US waters, is at least prepared to listen to this message. When Sugihara gave a lecture in June to a NMFS scientific panel on quota methodology in the North Pacific, his talk went on for two hours \u2014 three times as long as scheduled \u2014 as agency staff quizzed him on the details. \u201cIt was really interesting,\u201d says Jeffrey Polovina, a NMFS biological oceanographer who organized the meeting, held in Seattle. \u201cBut it was pretty complicated stuff. Most of us don't have the background in chaos theory.\u201d Sugihara hopes that the Ocean Resource Exchange will provide an incentive to preserve fish stocks that doesn't rely on a detailed understanding of complex biological systems, and instead taps into people's baser instincts. \u201cShow them how to make more money,\u201d he says. The first derivative is likely to be a futures contract for a certain percentage of a fisherman's catch at an agreed price at a specified time. Another planned derivative is an instrument for trading fish quota allotments, called an \u2018individual transfer quota\u2019. \u201cEssentially, these are tradable poker chips or options for fishing rights,\u201d Sugihara says. Fishermen and investors could hedge their bets, which should reduce the tendency for catches to swing between boom and bust, and give all stakeholders a tangible financial incentive not to cheat and plunder the ecosystem for the maximum short-term return. As a test of the idea, Sugihara is modelling the concept using data from a Californian squid fishery \u2014 where about 200 vessels bring in a haul worth up to US$36 million per year. But both catches and prices can fluctuate widely, making it a prime candidate for a market in derivatives. \u201cThe motive here is public service,\u201d he says. \u201cI think we can use market forces for conservation.\u201d \n                     Industry lured by the gains of going green \n                   \n                     Fisheries science: How many more fish in the sea? \n                   \n                     The physics of the trading floor \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},
{"file_id": "437468a", "url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/437468a", "year": 2005, "authors": [{"name": "Heike Langenberg"}], "parsed_as_year": "2006_or_before", "body": "Earth's climate depends strongly on clouds. But what really goes on within these layered structures? Heike Langenberg reports on two satellites that aim to find out. There's more to clouds than meets the eye. Look up on an overcast day, and you'll be presented with a sea of grey. But this blanket blotting out the Sun is merely the base of an intricate layered structure that rises vertically through the atmosphere. The composition of these layers helps to dictate what effect the clouds have on our climate. The results can be dramatic \u2014 but little is known about how these effects come about. Two satellites, scheduled for launch next month, are set to change all that. Named CloudSat and CALIPSO, these satellites will use radar and an equivalent technology based on light waves, known as lidar. They will cut through the layered structure of clouds to see how water droplets and airborne particles, or aerosols, are distributed around the globe. \u201cThis is a truly exciting time,\u201d says Graeme Stephens, a climatologist at Colorado State University and head of the CloudSat science team. \u201cWe're entering a new era of Earth observations with these missions.\u201d Clouds are one of the last great unknowns when it comes to understanding Earth's climate. They can both absorb and reflect the Sun's radiation before it reaches the planet's surface. They can also capture outgoing radiation from Earth. The scope of this effect depends in part on the distinct layering of the clouds and the variations in colour, density and altitude. The small water droplets that constitute clouds, and the even tinier particles that make up aerosols, act on scales much smaller than the 100-kilometre grids typically used in climate model calculations. Even worse, the distributions of clouds and aerosols can change rapidly over time, which limits the usefulness of observations taken during patchy measurement campaigns. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change recognized such uncertainties in its most recent report, citing cloud and aerosol effects as among the least understood of the factors that affect Earth's climate. \n               Cover story \n             But clouds are too important to climate for them to be ignored. A change of only about 1% in global cloudiness can either mask or double the effect that a decade's worth of greenhouse-gas emissions have on the amount of heat lost to space from Earth, says Bruce Wielicki, a climate researcher at NASA's Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia. And human activity can bring about changes in global cloudiness. Global warming caused by greenhouse-gas emissions can change the planet's water cycle, for example, and tiny aerosol particles emitted in pollution can change cloud properties and precipitation. Researchers continue to debate whether climate change has already brought about long-term changes to incoming solar radiation by altering cloudiness and so leading to either a dimming or a brightening on a global scale 1 , 2 , 3 . Such uncertainties are rooted partly in a lack of continuous, accurate cloud measurements from around the planet. Until now, most observations have measured only total cloud thickness. The new missions will go much further. One of CALIPSO's tasks, for instance, will be to observe the monthly global mean cloudiness down to variations of just 0.1%, says David Winker, who heads the satellite's science team at the Langley Research Center. Modelling cloud and aerosol dynamics presents problems for climate prediction, as the uncertainties are difficult to constrain 4 . Until now, getting data on the vertical distribution of cloud layers has been restricted to occasional reconnaissance flights. As a result, climate researchers cannot accurately estimate how aerosols will affect the radiative properties of clouds, a process known as the first indirect aerosol effect. Current satellites cannot tell whether or not aerosols and clouds occur at the same altitude, and so cannot tell whether the two are truly linked. With its 3-millimetre wavelength radar, CloudSat is designed to detect relatively large water droplets in both thick and thin clouds. CALIPSO \u2014 a tortured acronym for Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation \u2014 will use much shorter wavelengths to distinguish the fine details of thinner clouds and aerosols. Combining this information should provide a new benchmark for existing climate models, says Ulrike Lohmann, a climatologist at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich. The two satellites will fly in formation about 700 kilometres above Earth's surface, and will measure the same spot in the sky within 15 seconds of each other. These near-instantaneous observations will allow them to identify when clouds and aerosols are truly in the same layer, as opposed to located in separate layers that just happen to be vertically aligned. \n               Making a splash \n             CloudSat will also observe rain, so that researchers will similarly be able to tell when precipitation occurs in the same air mass as aerosols and cloud droplets. That, in turn, will help them to investigate the second indirect aerosol effect \u2014 how aerosols affect precipitation and cloud lifetime on a global scale 5 . \u201cCloudSat will be like a medical scan revealing the inner workings of clouds,\u201d says Stephens. Unlike many satellites, CloudSat and CALIPSO carry \u2018active\u2019 instruments, which send out their own electromagnetic signals \u2014 radio waves for CloudSat's radar and light waves for CALIPSO's lidar. These instruments record the time it takes for the signal to bounce off an obstacle, such as a cloud, and return to the satellite, thus revealing the cloud's altitude. CloudSat's radar will be able to cut through all but the densest clouds. The shorter-wavelength lidar on CALIPSO cannot cut through thick or frontal-storm clouds, but should be able to profile about 60% of all clouds, says Winker. The idea of using both radar and lidar to study clouds and aerosols from space has been around since at least the early 1990s, Stephens notes. But putting both instruments on one satellite proved too costly. By splitting the project in two, NASA spent $200 million on CloudSat and $175 million on CALIPSO. France's space agency helped to build the latter, and Canada contributed a key element to CloudSat's radar. Both satellites will be launched on a single rocket no earlier than 26 October from the Vandenberg Air Force Base in California. They will join three Earth observation satellites already in place: Aqua, which investigates Earth's water cycle; Aura, which focuses on air quality and stratospheric ozone; and PARASOL, which measures the direction and polarization of light in the atmosphere. Together, the satellite formation is called the \u2018afternoon constellation\u2019, or the \u2018A-train\u2019, because it crosses the equator at about 1:30 p.m. local time. One final satellite, the Orbiting Carbon Observatory, is slated to join the A-train in 2008. With only about 8 minutes between the passage of Aqua, the first satellite in the A-train, and Aura, the formation's tail end, the instruments see largely overlapping portions of the sky. \u201cThe A-train as a whole will sample practically all the clouds above Earth,\u201d says Stephens. Aqua's observations of cloud optical properties, in particular, should be invaluable in interpreting CloudSat's information on cloud layering. CloudSat and CALIPSO will also complement each other, as aerosols are intricately linked to the formation of clouds. In aerosol-rich air, for instance, clouds tend to be composed of a large number of small water droplets \u2014 a phenomenon that can affect the brightness of the clouds as well as their capacity to produce rain. Not all aerosols have the same effect. Most aerosols simply help cloud droplets to condense, but soot particles can also absorb some of the Sun's radiation and so warm the atmosphere, potentially thinning the cloud layers. CALIPSO will be able to distinguish the size and shape of aerosol particles. As those from human sources are typically ten times smaller than particles from natural sources, this should allow researchers to track specific sources of pollution. \n               Arctic role \n             Another area in which the satellites might contribute is charting Arctic clouds. To \u2018passive\u2019 instruments, which don't send out their own radar or lidar signals, these bright, cold clouds are hard to distinguish from the icy surface they float above. The active instruments on CloudSat and CALIPSO should be able to get around this problem by resolving these clouds into three-dimensions \u2014 making them stand out against the white background much like objects in a 3-D film do when the viewer dons red\u2013green glasses. CloudSat and CALIPSO's new observations should help modellers to see whether their simulated clouds are not only over the right region but also at the correct height. Repeating measurement slices through similar atmospheric conditions should uncover ways to formulate the model equations and, eventually, create more realistic models. \u201cThe statistical information from satellite data is invaluable for the validation of climate models,\u201d explains Lohmann. Yet for all their strengths, the two satellites cannot solve all the research problems of clouds and climate. Ideally, scientists would be able to trace air masses as they move, in order to study the evolution of clouds in the presence or absence of aerosols. CloudSat and CALIPSO will capture only a frozen picture in time, rather than the entire dynamic movie. But for now, climatologists are excited about the prospect of getting so much fresh information and finally plugging some holes in their understanding of Earth's climate. For once it seems it's not a bad thing to have your head in the clouds. \n                     Climate science: The dustiest place on Earth \n                   \n                     The impact of humidity above stratiform clouds on indirect aerosol climate forcing \n                   \n                     Pollution hits clouds on high \n                   \n                     Smoke clouds weather \n                   \n                     Sooty air sweeps away clouds \n                   \n                     CloudSat home page \n                   \n                     Calipso home page \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Mark Schrope flies into the eye of a storm to investigate. In the space of one October day, Hurricane Wilma escalated from a tropical storm to become the strongest hurricane from the Atlantic basin on record. It was a shift that no one saw coming, and Mexico's Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula bore the unexpectedly strong brunt of the storm. Over the past few decades, hurricane forecasters have dramatically improved their predictions of the paths that storms might follow. The accuracy of such \u2018track predictions\u2019 made 72 hours before a hurricane reaches land, for instance, have improved by more than 50% since 1970, according to the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). But over the same period, models for hurricane intensity have remained relatively primitive. The turbulence that drives the internal dynamics of a hurricane is mind-bogglingly complex. And without understanding that turbulence, and its effects on a storm's intensity, forecasters haven't really been able to improve their overall long-range forecasts. This year, correcting that situation became a high priority for hurricane research centres across the United States. During the most active Atlantic hurricane season on record, several new research programmes have wrestled with the question of intensity. The move may come not a moment too soon: two recent studies have suggested that hurricanes might grow more intense in the future because of climate change 1 , 2 . If so, the millions of people who live in vulnerable coastal areas will be at greater risk than ever, further underscoring the importance of good forecasts. \u201cIf you have accurate track and intensity forecasts that people can rely on, it will have a huge societal benefit,\u201d says Richard Anthes, a hurricane specialist and president of the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colorado. \u201cYou would save enormous amounts of energy and protect huge numbers of lives.\u201d One of the most extensive new programmes is a three-year, US$3-million plan to investigate how, why and when a hurricane's intensity changes. Funded by the National Science Foundation, the Hurricane Rainband and Intensity Change Experiment (RAINEX) combines a massive set of plane observations with experimental models. During August and September, RAINEX coordinated three aircraft equipped with Doppler radar to fly into the hearts of storms. All of the planes were WP-3D Orion \u2018hurricane hunters\u2019, more commonly known as P-3s. Two of them were run by NOAA; the third was owned by the Navy and carried ELDORA, the most advanced Doppler radar currently on hurricane duty. \n               Whirlwind start \n             Four years ago, when researchers first proposed RAINEX, they had no idea that their first year of action would bring them a nearly ideal set of storms. As coastal residents were battered by hurricane after hurricane, the RAINEX team gathered a bounty of data that may one day help protect against such devastation. In August, Hurricane Katrina tantalized forecasters as its bands of rain organized themselves symmetrically around the storm's eye, and then failed to develop into a feature that could have weakened the storm's intensity. In September, Hurricane Ophelia spun seemingly endlessly along the US southeastern coast, allowing the team to observe how a storm maintains its intensity over relatively cold water. Later that month, Hurricane Rita suddenly blew up in strength to reach the highest, category 5, rating. Aboard one of the P-3 flights into the heart of Rita after it had subsided to category 2, Brad Smull from the University of Washington in Seattle described the hurricane's unpredictability. \u201cDuring an eight-hour flight, the storm went from category 3 to category 5,\u201d he said over the din of the plane's engines and the hurricane. \u201cThat's very exciting.\u201d Repeatedly flying through the hurricane to reach Rita's eye brought its own kind of excitement, and it was difficult for me, a first-timer on the plane, to appreciate how relatively weak the storm had become. At times I had to clutch the handrail running the length of the P-3's ceiling to steady myself as the plane bucked. One of the hypotheses that RAINEX is testing is the idea that hurricanes grow in intensity because the bands of rain that swirl around the storm inject energy into the storm's eye. When the winds immediately around the eye \u2014 known as the eyewall \u2014 are strengthening, rainbands tend to spiral into the eye. At other times, the outer rainbands can begin to form their own circle, or secondary eyewall, around the eye. If this happens, the secondary eyewall often starves the inner eye of energy so that it begins to fall apart. And in some cases the secondary eyewall lasts long enough to become the primary eyewall, and even begins to strengthen further. Knowing exactly when and how this eyewall replacement happens is important for hurricane forecasts. But finding out means studying the flow of energy within a storm, which is no simple task. Hurricanes are fuelled when evaporation transfers heat from the ocean into the atmosphere. The resulting water vapour releases energy as it rises and condenses into clouds; this process heats the surrounding air, causing it, too, to rise. All this upward movement of air causes the pressure below it to drop and winds to start blowing. Surprisingly, estimates suggest that there is little difference between the amount of energy transferred from the ocean to a tropical storm and to a category 5 hurricane. But scientists are hard-pressed to explain why, in a hurricane, much of the transfer is concentrated in the relatively small area of the eye. These zones of energy transfer are crucial to controlling a storm's shifts in intensity, but are hard to study because they can be small and move around rapidly. \n               Flight coordinators \n             Getting a good picture of how the eyewall and rain bands interact requires observing both structures simultaneously. But typical hurricane reconnaissance flights can't do that because they mainly crisscross a storm's eye. The RAINEX plan uses three planes: one flying through the eye, one flying on the inside edge of the main rainband, and the other taking the outside edge of the band \u2014 something that had never been done before. \u201cIt's really fantastic that we have been able to accomplish this,\u201d says Smull. Coordinating this aeronautical dance wasn't easy. The planes maintained a satellite connection to a computer chat room, so that scientists in the air could \u2018talk\u2019 to each other and to the command centre in Miami, Florida. Flight paths were constantly updated based on radar data as well as the chat-room information. \u201cIt was a very nerve-wracking process,\u201d says Shuyi Chen of the University of Miami, who with Robert Houze of the University of Washington is principal investigator for RAINEX. Each plane uses Doppler radar to gather core data about cloud structure and winds, which reveal locations of greatest turbulence. But expanding the radar's information into a three-dimensional view of the storm requires vertical profiles of temperature and wind. The planes can't fly straight down to acquire that, nor can they fly safely at levels below 5,000 feet, so they use instruments called dropsondes. At key points the plane releases dropsondes, which radio back real-time information on temperature, pressure and wind speed until they hit the water. But improving understanding of hurricane intensity takes more than data from planes. \u201cObservation doesn't really give you the full picture,\u201d says Wen-Chau Lee, a RAINEX investigator at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder. \u201cEven with eight-hour coordinated flights, we're still getting only snapshots, and we don't sample the storm for the entire 24 hours.\u201d \n               Whipping up a storm \n             Making sense out of these snapshots requires computer modelling. At the operations centre in Miami, researchers use experimental models to compare their predictions with data arriving from the hurricane flights. If scientists could better understand why hurricanes change intensity, they might also be able to improve their predictions of a storm's path, says Lee. Large-scale environmental factors play the biggest role in influencing where a hurricane goes, but internal dynamics are also important. Along with RAINEX, various other projects under way this year will help hurricane researchers to answer the many questions about intensity changes. Several fall under the umbrella of the Intensity Forecasting Experiment (IFEX), which is managed by NOAA's Hurricane Research Division in Miami. IFEX covers a variety of projects, including studies of tropical cyclones forming in their earliest stages in the eastern Pacific, as well as storms decaying in the northern Pacific. Historically, researchers have tended to study only mature storms, leading to deficiencies in understanding the complete storm cycle. Another IFEX programme has been testing unmanned aircraft for monitoring the lower levels of storms at resolutions much higher than is possible with dropsondes. Many hurricane experts are confident that all this work will soon pay off. Anthes, for one, says that better observational and satellite data, combined with improved computers, should help to improve intensity forecasts in coming years. \u201cI see no fundamental reason why we shouldn't be able to predict intensity much better,\u201d he says. \u201cWe just need very high-resolution models and good understanding of cloud physics and dynamics.\u201d One such high-resolution tool is already under development at NOAA's Environmental Modeling Center in Camp Springs, Maryland. Called the Hurricane Weather Research and Forecasting model, it is scheduled to begin operation in 2007. It will incorporate the conclusions of RAINEX, IFEX and other ongoing projects, and will have nearly an order of magnitude better resolution than the main models currently in use. For coastal residents who are wary of the coming hurricane seasons, such improvements can't come soon enough. \n                     Into the eye of the storm \n                   \n                     Hurricane link to climate change is hazy \n                   \n                     Trouble brews over contested trend in hurricanes \n                   \n                     Hurricane Charley highlights prediction problems \n                   \n                     In focus: hurricanes \n                   \n                     National Hurricane Center \n                   \n                     RAINEX home page \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

John Whitfield investigates. In the mid-1970s, the love affair between climatologists and computer models was beginning to blossom. By breaking down the atmosphere and ocean into ever-smaller interacting chunks in simulations, researchers found that they could mimic the behaviour of the global climate with reasonable success. But for Garth Paltridge, a climate scientist at the University of Tasmania in Hobart, Australia, these general circulation models (GCMs) were coming at the problem from the wrong direction. \u201cI felt it was like trying to describe the behaviour of a gas by following the path of every molecule,\u201d he says. Instead, Paltridge decided to look for a simple, general principle that might explain the climate as a whole \u2014 similar to the physical laws that predict the behaviour of a gas as the average state of its countless molecules. He focused on the concept of entropy, a measure of the disorder in a system created as it does work. His idea that the climate maximizes its entropy production 1  stirred a flurry of interest at the time. But it did little to halt the GCM bandwagon. And in time, even Paltridge stopped working on it. Now he is back on the case. In the past couple of years, Paltridge's hypothesis of maximum entropy production (MEP) has been given a new theoretical underpinning. And although it's early days, researchers are exploring the concept as an explanation of the behaviour of complex systems, from the climate to cells, organisms, ecosystems and economies 2 . Entropy could even explain how linked complex systems interact, which could potentially lend legitimacy to the contentious theory of Gaia \u2014 the idea that living things act together to regulate Earth's climate to keep conditions favourable for life. \n               Cycle of violence \n             Paltridge's original model was very simple: splitting Earth into ten regions, it used only a few parameters, such as the strength of solar energy and Earth's reflectivity. More solar energy falls on the equatorial region than on the poles, and our weather results from the redistribution of this energy, through winds, currents and water vapour. Paltridge found that if he maximized the rate at which the atmosphere and oceans dissipated energy, his model world generated temperatures and cloud cover very similar to those seen for real. Our climate, he argued, creates weather that is as violent as possible, given the amount of energy available. The problem was that there was no clear theoretical justification for why this should be so. The second law of thermodynamics states that a closed system will arrive at a state of maximum entropy, but it says nothing about how quickly it will get there, or about how much entropy a system such as the climate, which experiences a constant and massive input of energy, will produce. Over the years, Paltridge and a few others tried to find a theory for MEP, and failed. Perhaps the resemblance between our climate and a system tuned to generate maximum disorder was just chance. But the discovery that MEP could apply to atmospheres besides Earth's made it seem less of a coincidence. In 2001, Ralph Lorenz, a planetary scientist at the University of Arizona in Tucson, was trying to model the climate on Saturn's moon Titan. Titan is smaller than Earth, has a thicker atmosphere, and turns more slowly. This ought to mean that heat moves quickly through its atmosphere, making polar and equatorial climates very similar. Yet Titan's equator is 4 \u00b0C warmer than its poles. Only when Lorenz applied an MEP model could he produce the right temperature difference 3 . The same approach also gave accurate predictions of the winds and carbon dioxide frosts on Mars, which has a much thinner atmosphere than Earth and whose weather had similarly stumped conventional climate models. MEP is not the same as maximizing the rate of heat transport. A system's entropy production depends on its energy input, and \u2014 crucially \u2014 on the temperature difference between its interacting parts. Very rapid heat transport would level out the temperature gradient between Titan's equator and poles, and so reduce the amount of work that its atmosphere could do, as if a ball were rolling slowly down a very gentle slope. Very slow heat transport would create a large temperature gradient, but the system would be close to equilibrium, and little work would be done \u2014 like a ball trying to roll down a steep but sticky slope. MEP needs a climate somewhere between these two extremes. Lorenz became an entropy enthusiast. \u201cI was evangelical about it \u2014 it made so much intrinsic sense,\u201d he says. But still the theoretical problem remained. The breakthrough came in 2003, when Roderick Dewar, a theoretical physicist turned ecosystem modeller working for INRA, the French agricultural research agency, in Bordeaux, turned to information theory \u2014 a branch of mathematics dealing with communication and uncertainty. Thermodynamics can be expressed in terms of information theory: in the 1950s, it had been shown that the entropy of a system in equilibrium, such as a sealed container of gas, can be reformulated as a measure of missing information. \n               Out of order \n             Dewar extended the theory to non-equilibrium systems \u2014 such as the planetary climates modelled by Paltridge and Lorenz. In essence, he showed that what is true for a small container of gas molecules, with no energy input, should also apply if you put an astronomical number of gas and water molecules into an atmosphere-sized container and heat them up. Dewar's theory says that for a large, complex system, the state of MEP is the most probable sum of its microscopic parts 4 , 5 . One need know only the constraints that influence the behaviour of the whole system, and nothing about the seething complexity of all its constituent parts because, at the large scale, all the different microscopic arrangements look the same. \u201cWhat we see at the macroscopic scale is the most probable behaviour, because it can be realized in the greatest number of ways microscopically,\u201d Dewar says. But the theory comes with strings attached. First, the system must also be free to \u2018choose\u2019 between different states. For the climate this should be no problem: it has myriad possible configurations, from the local changeability of wind and clouds, to switches between ice ages and interglacial periods. But the theory also applies only to systems in a steady state: that is, enough energy must be passing through to preserve large-scale structure, but not so much, or so little, that this structure is disrupted. For the climate, this might not always be the case: a world that was rotating very rapidly; had a very thin atmosphere; which was in a glaciated, \u2018snowball\u2019 state; or which was experiencing strong man-made climate change, might be prevented from settling into MEP. These constraints may limit the utility of MEP for climate modelling. Although the climate might be in a steady state on a planetary scale, and over long time-frames, at other scales things are always changing. What's more, ice, clouds and the ocean at different depths and latitudes respond to the same forces at vastly different rates. \u201cIt's not just the end result that's important, it's how you get there,\u201d says Kevin Trenberth of the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colorado. Lorenz agrees that MEP is unlikely to revolutionize the way we model the climate \u2014 but he believes the idea could also be used to gauge the trustworthiness of GCMs. If a model's output is very far from MEP, it should throw up a warning flag, he suggests. Where MEP theory will be most useful, he adds, is as a means of getting a broad-brush picture of climates about which we know very little, such as those of extrasolar planets, or in Earth's distant history. MEP models allow surface temperatures across a planet to be calculated from knowing only how much of its star's light falls on it, how much is reflected back into space, the tilt of the world's axis, and its absorbance of infrared radiation. All these parameters can in principle be measured with a telescope 6 . \n               Natural disarray \n             Now researchers are looking for other systems that might be amenable to modelling using Dewar's theory. Plate tectonics, in which rock dissipates heat generated by radioactivity as it flows, might be complex enough to attain MEP 6 ; so might the growth of crystals 7 . And Hisashi Ozawa, a climatologist at Hiroshima University in Japan, who has previously studied the entropy production of ocean currents 8 , is now staging small avalanches of powder in his laboratory, to see if MEP can explain the patterns that form at the front of the sliding mass. \u201cThere are many natural phenomena to which the MEP hypothesis can be applied,\u201d Ozawa says. \u201cIt's attractive because it's very general: it doesn't depend on specific physical and chemical properties.\u201d Lorenz wonders about applications in economics. Money and goods flow between people in a similar way to heat in the atmosphere, he says: \u201cI see a direct analogy between temperature gradients and price gradients.\u201d But economists aren't getting carried away just yet. \u201cThe deliberate nature of human actions makes economic systems qualitatively different from the climate, and adds an extra layer of complexity,\u201d says economist Matthias Ruth, of the University of Maryland in College Park. Dewar is now working to apply MEP theory to biological systems ranging from cells to the planet. At a small scale, he is trying to see whether the theory can explain when plants open and close their stomata, tiny pores in the leaves that regulate the flow of gases and water vapour in and out. This has traditionally been explained in terms of the plant's efforts to maximize its photosynthesis and minimize its water loss; perhaps it might be reinterpreted as the leaf maximizing the entropy produced by gas exchange. If so, this would indicate that the biologically optimal state is also, in physical terms, the most probable state. At the ecosystem level, ecologists have long used a metric called the Shannon diversity index, based on the number of species in a given place and their relative numbers. This index is mathematically identical to a measure of entropy. Dewar suspects that MEP theory might be able to predict the number of species in a place based on its energy input, and possibly explain why the places with most energy, the tropics, are also the most diverse \u2014 or, in other words, entropic. At the global scale, Dewar and his colleagues are trying to put numbers on the fluxes of solar energy, heat, water vapour and carbon dioxide between plants and the atmosphere. Previously, these have been added to climate models as ad hoc fudge factors: MEP might allow them to be calculated from fundamental principles. \n               Total anarchy \n             By linking vegetation and the climate, MEP also offers a new twist on the Gaia hypothesis. The problem for Gaia theorists has been explaining why Earth's organisms should en masse \u2018want\u2019 to maintain a stable climate. MEP might offer a way out, says Axel Kleidon, a biogeophysicist at the University of Maryland. According to his models, provided a planet is suitable for life in the first place, biological activity increases the entropy production of the entire planetary system, both living and non-living. It also increases the number of states that the system can adopt, he says, so making MEP more likely 9 . This would give a version of Gaia in which life isn't manipulating the climate to its own ends. Instead, if both climate and ecosystems tend to a state of MEP, the stability of the climate becomes a by-product of this state, towards which the system will return when perturbed. Yet the concerns voiced regarding other applications of MEP theory still apply. Is life, at the planetary scale, in a steady state? And is it free to enter maximum entropy production? Based on his modelling, Tim Lenton of the University of East Anglia in Norwich, UK, one of the leading lights of Gaia research, is sceptical. \u201cGaia would benefit from a sound theoretical footing, but there's still a gap between Dewar's very elegant theoretical treatment and many of the systems we're interested in,\u201d he says. Ecosystem modeller Marcel van Oijen of the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology in Edinburgh is is also unsure whether MEP is compatible with what we know about evolution: natural selection might be a force strong enough to prevent life from attaining maximum entropy production. \u201cThe problem of reconciling MEP and natural selection will be a focus of debate in coming years,\u201d he says. \u201cI see adaptation and constraints everywhere in biology, and these aren't accounted for in the derivation of MEP.\u201d Dewar is undaunted, and predicts that a new order will arise from the current chaos, as theorists wrestle with the various potential applications of MEP. \u201cThe underlying theory suggests that it's entirely general,\u201d he says. \u201cIt's an organizational principle that potentially unifies biological and physical processes.\u201d \n                     All creatures great and small \n                   \n                     The demon pretender \n                   \n                     Tempus Fugit \n                   \n                     Nature  Insight on complex systems \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

David Cyranoski meets a man who just can\u2019t stand still. Modesty is not one of Philip Yeo's faults. As we tour Biopolis, the futuristic complex that is the centrepiece of Yeo's efforts to turn Singapore into a powerhouse for biomedical research, he announces that he has never failed in an attempt to headhunt a leading scientist to join the campus. \u201cI have patience,\u201d he says with a wry smile. Yeo's friends and admirers will be amused by this comment. Ask them for a description of him and the adjectives flow readily: persistent, passionate, provocative, even playful. But patience is rarely identified as a trait of this government official \u2014 a man whose charismatic influence on his nation's science policy has no obvious parallel anywhere in the world. Since 1999, Yeo has chaired Singapore's main research organization, now known as the Agency for Science, Technology and Research, or A*STAR. Over the past couple of years, the agency has spent some US$300 million building Biopolis, which houses research institutes specializing in genomics, bioinformatics, bioprocessing and bioengineering. It is part of a multibillion-dollar investment in biomedicine, designed to nurture industries in biotechnology and drugs. Yeo has led from the front, enforcing an aggressive schedule and attracting some of the biggest names in biology to head the complex's lavishly equipped labs. \u201cHe has so much energy. If you tapped it, you could light a small city,\u201d says cell biologist Axel Ullrich, who was recruited from the Max Planck Institute of Biochemistry in Martinsried, Germany. Biomedical research is just the latest endeavour to be swept up by the Yeo whirlwind. An engineer by training, his career took off in the 1970s when, as an official in the Ministry of Defence, he helped to turn a struggling manufacturer of munitions for the Singaporean military into an international supplier of armaments. Then, as chairman of the Economic Development Board from 1986, he oversaw the expansion of the semiconductor and electronics industries that has underpinned Singapore's economic miracle. And in a country where the boundaries between government and business are somewhat blurry, he has also become a wealthy electronics entrepreneur. \n               Island builder \n             By the late 1990s, Yeo's attention had shifted to the chemical industry. In his office, he proudly shows me satellite images documenting the year-by-year construction of an artificial island named Jurong. Today, it houses a huge petrochemical complex and has attracted some US$23 billion in investments from multinational companies. \u201cIt takes about five years to build each industry. Then I move on,\u201d he says. Given this track record, Yeo has the trust of Singapore's leaders, who have given him almost total control over the nation's science budget. In a society known for its conservatism, he's a one-off \u2014 an impish character who darts out his tongue to punctuate each provocative statement, and who clearly relishes every minute of his working day. Three walls in his office are covered by white writing boards. As he explains his plans for Biopolis, Yeo jumps up and scribbles notes. Again, he shows me satellite images, before we drive to the complex for a whistle-stop tour. In addition to the gleaming labs, he makes a point of showing me the basement car park \u2014 a colour-coded expanse that wouldn't look out of place at an international airport \u2014 and a new French restaurant. \u201cIt is a self-contained city,\u201d says Yeo. \u201cThe only thing I can't control is the weather.\u201d Yet Yeo has found biomedicine a tougher nut to crack than the subjects of his previous grand schemes. \u201cWith biology you have to read and read before you can absorb and understand,\u201d he says. When Biopolis was on the drawing board, he took Saturday tutorials on immunology from local researchers. \u201cImmunology is related to sexy fields such as stem cells and cancer, but it has been neglected,\u201d he says. Next to his office is a room full of primary literature on all of these fields. When he finds something interesting, he sends it to scientists at his institutes. \u201cI do my homework,\u201d he says. \n               Magnetic personality \n             For some of the big names who have been attracted to Biopolis, Yeo's personal enthusiasm for their work was a powerful draw. \u201cHe always sends PDFs of papers he's reading. I'm just trying to keep up with him,\u201d says David Lane, who in January was recruited from the University of Dundee in Scotland to head the Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology at Biopolis. Even more popular is Yeo's policy of giving his principal investigators large five-year grants with no strings attached. \u201cAs a bureaucrat, I don't tell the scientists what to do. I let them decide,\u201d he says. The lucky recipients say they can get things done in months that elsewhere would take years just to clear the red tape. \u201cIt's fun,\u201d says Lane. \u201cI've never before been anywhere they say you can do whatever you want.\u201d In addition to headhunting big-hitters such as Lane, renowned for his work on the  p53  tumour-suppressor gene, Yeo has made a concerted effort to bring young people into science. Recruitment posters present biology as a hip activity. One, in a scene reminiscent of  The Simpsons , pictures a student at a blackboard repeatedly scrawling: \u201cI will not genetically manipulate the class hamster\u201d. Another features an attractive young woman \u2014 the \u2018DNA girl\u2019 \u2014 with a double-helix tattoo encircling her arm. The caption reads: \u201cGot a burning passion for science? We'll take it to the highest level.\u201d Those fast-tracked into A*STAR university scholarships get generous grants, but are given only three years to finish courses that take most students four. And Yeo thinks the brightest could be pushed still harder. \u201cThey could do it in two years,\u201d he says. The promotion of youth is a recurring theme. In Yeo's office, there are few greying civil servants; instead, he is surrounded by a coterie of bright, sharply dressed young staff. During our interview, they rush around providing background material to reinforce the points their boss is making. But Yeo's aggressive youth policy has gained critics, as well as admirers. In early May, one Singaporean student working in the United States, writing a weblog under the pseudonym \u2018AcidFlask\u2019, criticized A*STAR's scholarship scheme and the expectations it places on students. A*STAR immediately threatened legal action, and the student \u2014 not himself an A*STAR scholar \u2014 apologized for a posting that was \u201cdefamatory of A*STAR, its Chairman, Mr. Philip Yeo, and its executive officers\u201d. With characteristic wit, Yeo issued a press release inviting the blogger to tea. Yeo seems to relish such confrontations. In a newspaper interview given shortly after the incident, he laid into male students who break their contractual obligations to work for A*STAR for six years after their scholarships, saying he was tired of \u201cwhining Singaporean boys\u201d. He hands me a copy of the article. \u201cI had to scold them,\u201d he says, adding that most A*STAR scholars are now foreigners and Singaporean women. And during our interview, he can't help taking another shot at  Nature 's coverage of his controversial 2001 move to close the Institute of Molecular Agrobiology. At the time, Yeo suggested that the journal should have paid the institute's running costs. Even now Yeo scoffs at the idea that the institute might have been able to offer agriculture-related intellectual property to Singapore's economy. \u201cYou've got to be kidding!\u201d he exclaims. \n               Breaking the mould \n             It's not what I've come to expect from high-level government officials, but Yeo's supporters say that his combative and autocratic traits are part of the package that makes him so effective. It's difficult to imagine a similar character rising to the top in the more consensual environment of most national research agencies, says Ullrich. \u201cElsewhere, there is no space for people like Yeo,\u201d he notes. \u201cHe would become frustrated.\u201d If Yeo can deliver on his promise to turn Singapore into a biotech and pharmaceutical powerhouse, its leaders will forgive him the occasional spat. Drug manufacturers lured to Singapore by generous tax breaks are already bringing in annual revenues of about US$9.5 billion a year. Yeo predicts that by 2015 the commercial spin-offs from homegrown research will have boosted this figure to US$15 billion. The next phase of Yeo's master plan is the Centre for Molecular Medicine, where 150 researchers will bring advances in regenerative medicine, oncogenomics, immunology and epithelial biology to the clinic. Currently housed in Biopolis, it will move next year to the nearby National University of Singapore, to take advantage of its teaching hospital. The centre will include a facility for the scaled-up production of stem cells for clinical use. \u201cNobody's doing that,\u201d says Yeo. \u201cIndustrialization is Singapore's strength.\u201d And by 2010, an expanded Biopolis will be joined by an information-technology hub called Fusionopolis, plus a complex designed to incubate spin-off businesses. Lane sees the early signs of commercial success in the form of collaborations among institutes at Biopolis and industry. And with drug giants such Novartis and Eli Lilly establishing research bases at Biopolis, the future looks promising. \u201cIt's an amazing experiment here,\u201d says Lane. \u201cI was overwhelmed by the opportunity.\u201d Indeed, the biggest worry for many of Singapore's scientific leaders is what will happen should Yeo eventually retire. A youthful-looking 58, Yeo shows no signs of slowing down. And he is typically provocative when asked how Singaporean science would fare if he were no longer around. \u201cI'm not indispensable,\u201d he says, \u201cbut I am irreplaceable.\u201d \n                     Singapore: Filling Biopolis \n                   \n                     A * STAR \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Erika Check hears of their harrowing experience. As Ruth Berggren slept in a darkened hospital room, the hot, muggy air settled damply on her skin. Nothing stirred; the air-conditioning and lights had shut down days before, when Hurricane Katrina knocked out Charity Hospital's main power. Berggren and her husband Tyler Curiel, leading scientists in New Orleans' academic community, had been waiting for rescue for days. They were hoping to save the patients of Charity's Ward 9 West. Suddenly, Berggren heard someone shouting. She leapt from her bed and ran into the pitch-black hallway. She saw a sweaty young Marine, twitching nervously as he held his gun. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d he barked, shining a flashlight in her face. \u201cI was told this floor had been evacuated!\u201d Hearing the commotion, Curiel bounded into the hallway. The soldier, startled, raised his gun. \u201cI'm the physician in charge of this ward, and we have not been evacuated!\u201d a terrified Berggren shouted. The Marine lowered his gun and continued on his rounds. Later, Berggren recalled the episode as another frustrating reminder of her patients' situation. In the midst of a lawless, desperate city, poor people with AIDS had been abandoned yet again. Berggren and Curiel, both faculty members at Tulane University, landed at the epicentre of the Katrina disaster more or less by accident. Berggren, an infectious disease specialist, teaches at Charity Hospital one month a year. She happened to be on call on Sunday 28 August, the day Katrina's winds began to pound the US Gulf Coast. Curiel, a cancer immunologist and oncologist, stayed behind with her. The first days were relatively calm. The storm blew in on Sunday morning and out by Monday evening. At Tulane's medical centre, across the street from Charity, Curiel cared for patients and worried about what might happen if the power failed. He and a graduatestudent rushed through his lab, transferring valuable cell lines from electric freezers into tanks cooled by liquid nitrogen. By Tuesday morning, New Orleans was drowning, swamped by waters that poured through a levee breach. Administrators at Tulane, a private hospital, hired helicopters and evacuated their patients. Then Curiel borrowed a canoe and paddled across the street to his wife. The situation at Charity was disintegrating. The hospital had no money to call in a private evacuation for its 250 patients. Bottled water was plentiful, but food was rationed to a few cups of ravioli and a handful of canned green beans each day. When the hospital ran out of diesel to power its generators, the staff helped patients on respirators breathe with hand pumps. Despite the worsening conditions, the Ward 9 West shift manager, Mitch Handrich, vowed that no staff members would leave until every patient was evacuated. The staff tried to bolster patients' spirits; on Wednesday, they staged a talent show for the ward. That night, the National Guard finally arrived and evacuated five of Berggren's patients. But on Thursday morning, gunshots erupted as Curiel was helping load patients into trucks on the emergency room ramp. Curiel says he saw a man in a white shirt firing bullets at the rescue workers from a parking deck. \u201cSniper!\u201d the guardsmen shouted. \n               Toxic smoke \n             Staff members scrambled to get the patients to safety. But the damage was done; the National Guard called off the operation and abandoned the building. Only 50 patients had been evacuated, leaving 200 stranded \u2014 including 13 in Berggren's ward. That night, Berggren and Curiel had their encounter with the Marine. When they woke up Friday morning, a chemical plant had exploded nearby, spreading a pall of tom, xic smoke for miles around. For the first time, they began to think they might not make it out of Charity alive. But television coverage of the shootings alerted the nation to the hospital's plight. On Friday, the National Guard relaunched its evacuation effort. All of Berggren's patients were out of the hospital by Friday afternoon. The next day, Curiel, Berggren and her ward's staff evacuated to Texas. One week later, Curiel returned, escorted by armed guards, to learn the fate of his research materials. He thought his life's work had been lost. But when he opened the first nitrogen tank, a tell-tale puff of cool vapour wafted up into his face. He knew then that his samples were safe. \n                     New Orleans researchers fight to salvage work from submerged labs \n                   \n                     www.nature.com/news/infocus/hurricanes.html \n                   \n                     Tulane University Hospital \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Claire Ainsworth reports. \u201cWhat's in sperm?\u201c demands Tim Karr. It's an unusual start to a lab visit, and I confess that I know little more than the sketchy textbook picture. I'm not alone, says Karr, and that is the whole problem. \u201cHow can we not know?\u201d he asks. \u201cIt probably explains why we don't understand sex.\u201d Karr, who works at the University of Bath, UK, is convinced that a more detailed knowledge of the molecular biology of sperm will help answer some of biology's most fundamental questions. This is what prompted him to spend the past three years dissecting fruitfly testes and developing methods to study the protein content \u2014 or proteome \u2014 of their sperm. Sperm are amenable to detailed proteomic analysis because they contain no more than a few hundred proteins. But this apparent simplicity is deceptive. Karr's team is one of several to have found that there is far more to sperm than we thought. In addition to the DNA instructions that spell out a male's contribution to a new life, these sleek, whip-powered cells have in the past few years been shown to carry other pieces of cellular machinery, such as RNA and proteins. This discovery is changing our understanding of fertility, development and the evolution of sex. \u201cIt really challenges some basic ideas,\u201d says Stephen Krawetz, a biologist at Wayne State University School of Medicine in Detroit, Michigan. Because sperm have to swim far and fast, biologists have come to view them like racing cars: streamlined and stripped down of all unnecessary bits and pieces. Generally speaking, the DNA in animal sperm is tightly packed inside a sleek head structure that contains little of the cytoplasm that fills most other cells. Behind the head is the midpiece, containing more than 50 power units called mitochondria that drive the lashing motion of the attached tail. \n               Egged on \n             Given the shortage of cytoplasm, and the lack of any detectable protein synthesis in mature sperm heads, biologists had long assumed that sperm contribute little to an embryo bar the father's genes. In contrast, the egg is replete with molecules such as proteins and RNAs that nourish and direct the development of the embryo. \u201cThe idea was that the egg was supplying everything and Dad was just tagging along with his DNA,\u201d says Krawetz. Recent discoveries have revealed the error of this view. Studies now suggest that defects in sperm can disrupt embryo development even if the genes carried by the cells are perfectly normal 1 . And there are hints that faulty sperm could be the cause of a significant number of miscarriages, says David Miller, a reproductive biologist at the University of Leeds, UK. \u201cSo we know sperm is important.\u201d But what does a sperm deliver? One popular misconception is that only the head enters the egg, while the tail is discarded. But in most species, the entire cell enters the egg \u2014 midpiece, tail and all 2 . And in many mammals, midpiece and tail structures persist in the embryo for several cell divisions 3 . This results in a large number of proteins and other molecules being delivered to the egg. In mammals other than rodents, these include a piece of cellular machinery called the centrosome, which coordinates the molecular ropes cells use to haul chromosomes around during cell division 4 . Until 2002, this was thought to be an isolated example. But then a team headed by Anthony Lai at the University of Wales in Cardiff discovered that sperm also deliver a molecule called PLC\u03b6 that triggers the waves of calcium ions that activate a fertilized egg 5 . And a bigger surprise came when Krawetz and Miller studied sperm from 10 fertile men and found that they contained some 3,000 different kinds of messenger RNA 6 . Some of them coded for proteins needed for early embryo development; others were previously unknown, and had no equivalents in the egg. \n               Male delivery \n             This suggested that sperm could deliver RNAs that help direct an embryo's early development. Some biologists were sceptical, arguing that the RNAs were simply non-functional leftovers from the process of sperm development. But Krawetz, Miller and others have since gathered more evidence, and last year showed that a specific package of RNAs are indeed transferred from sperm to egg 7 . Earlier this year, Krawetz and his colleagues found that these include micro-RNAs, which don't code for proteins but are known to play a role in controlling gene activity 8 . It remains unclear what the transferred RNA does. The fact that cloning works, and the creation last year of a mouse by combining the nuclei of two eggs 9 , both suggest it is not absolutely essential for embryo development. But these processes are grossly inefficient and often result in birth defects or abnormal gene activity, which hints that the paternal RNA may be important. Miller suggests that messenger RNAs help protect paternal genes that are needed soon after fertilization from being shut down as sperm mature. Normally, most of a sperm's DNA is tightly wrapped up and gagged by proteins called protamines. The RNAs could stick to the genes that code for them and stop this, he argues. Another possibility is that paternal RNAs, particularly micro-RNAs, might be involved in controlling imprinting \u2014 the differential activation of genes according to whether they are inherited from the mother or the father. Certainly, the idea that the RNAs have no function is becoming a minority view. \u201cSperm are so sleek and have such powerful methods for eliminating everything that causes drag that I don't believe they are vestigial,\u201d says Gerald Schatten, a reproductive biologist at the University of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The new view of sperm as carriers of molecules crucial for early embryo development has thought-provoking implications for reproductive medicine. Comparing the RNA profiles of fertile and infertile men might reveal causes of unexplained infertility, says Miller. Such studies may also raise questions about the wisdom of an  in vitro  fertilization technique called intracytoplasmic sperm injection, or ICSI, used to help men whose sperm do not fertilize their partner's eggs. ICSI involves injecting faulty or immature sperm \u2014 which might lack the normal complement of RNAs \u2014 directly into eggs. So far, there are no clear signs of problems among children conceived by ICSI, although long-term follow-up is needed to confirm the safety of the technique. Now the action in sperm biology is moving from RNA to proteins. Last year, Christopher Barratt, a reproductive biologist at the University of Birmingham, UK, published the first proteomic study of male infertility. His aim was not to produce a complete proteome for sperm; instead, his team looked for differences in the protein profiles in the sperm of an infertile and a fertile man. The researchers found at least 20 proteins present in significantly different quantities 10 , giving them a starting point to study cases of unexplained infertility and suggesting targets for new contraceptives. \n               Origins of life \n             The coming months could see the first publications from groups, including Karr's, that are conducting more comprehensive proteomic studies. Being able to compare the structure and content of the proteomes of sperm from different species should help researchers understand the evolution and origin of sperm. In particular, having a comprehensive catalogue of proteins to compare between different species may reveal how natural selection is operating on them, says Steve Dorus, a postdoc in Karr's lab. \u201cIt should give us some pretty powerful information about what our ancestors' core sperm attributes were.\u201d While Karr's group works on fruitfly sperm, Victor Vacquier, a reproductive biologist at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla, California, is producing a catalogue of the proteins found in the outer membrane of sperm of the purple sea urchin ( Strongylocentrotus purpuratus ). His particular interest lies in understanding how sperm and egg interact and recognize each other. Surprisingly, scientists know comparatively little about the molecules that interact when a sperm comes into contact with an egg's surface. But they do know that, in some species, such proteins can evolve extraordinarily rapidly 11 . Vacquier believes that these fast-evolving proteins may help explain why some animal populations become reproductively isolated, leading to the formation of new species. The origin of species, the evolution of sex, the mysteries of infertility \u2014 these are some of the biggest and most intriguing questions in biology. Long dismissed as mere delivery boys, it seems that sperm are about to be put on the promotion fast track. \n                     Developmental biology: Synthetic sex cells \n                   \n                     Sperm like it hot \n                   \n                     Sperm train to win \n                   \n                     Healthy sperm fingerprinted \n                   \n                     Nature Fertility Outlook \n                   \n                     Nature Medicine/Nature Cell Biology Fertility Supplement \n                   \n                     Nature Germ Cells Web Focus \n                   \n                     Tim Karr \n                   \n                     Stephen Krawetz \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Amanda Haag meets the planetary scientist who nursed the mission through its darkest days. In the spaceflight business, delayed gratification is often part of the deal. The time between a launch and the scientific pay-off may be a decade or more. So for the man leading a mission that is about to begin its ten-year voyage to Pluto, the downtime of space travel promises one sure thing: more time for research. Planetary scientist Alan Stern is principal investigator for NASA's New Horizons mission \u2014 slated for a January launch \u2014 to Pluto and the frosty worlds beyond. He has flown in fighter jets to conduct upper-atmosphere experiments, sent instruments to visit comets, and qualified as a mission specialist for the space shuttle. In between, he led the assembly of one of the world's most \u00e9lite and creative groups of planetary scientists, based at the Southwest Research Institute (SwRI) in Boulder, Colorado. Of all these accomplishments, Pluto is likely to be the most public legacy of this 47-year-old space junkie. For years, Stern was for the most part a lone voice arguing for a mission that looked as if it might never get off the ground. Various incarnations of a Pluto spacecraft had been funded and cancelled over a period of 12 years before Stern resurrected the notion in the form of New Horizons. But even then, a two-year funding battle ensued, with New Horizons' future hanging by a budgetary thread. \u201cIt took more years to get this mission out of the Washington beltway than it does to cross the entire expanse of the Solar System,\u201d he says, only half-joking. It didn't take that long for the space bug to bite the young Stern. Like many children in the 1960s, he grew up hugely inspired by the Apollo space programme. \u201cEverybody had an astronaut helmet and a little silver Halloween suit,\u201d recalls Stern. As a teenager, he was the quintessential space nerd. \u201cCapitalize the \u2018N\u2019\u201d he jokes. But that fascination didn't always translate to scholastic accomplishment. After years in a strict boys' prep school in Dallas, Stern relished the freedom at the Austin campus of the University of Texas so much that he nearly flunked out and left. Six months later, after working as a dock hand and cutting chicken for a fast-food restaurant, he decided to give academia another shot. \n               Launched anew \n             With his trademark intensity, he soon acquired both double undergraduate and double master's degrees. Two years in the aerospace industry convinced him to look at academia as a career option, and in 1983 he landed work at the Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics at the University of Colorado's Boulder campus. Stern recalls spending one winter in Alaska shooting a sounding rocket into the aurora borealis as a satellite flew through the lights. Soon, one of his primary jobs became helping to build a pair of ultraviolet spectrometers that would study Comet Halley from aboard the space shuttle Challenger. As the project unfolded, Stern gravitated towards the science rather than the engineering. \u201cIt really swept me off my feet,\u201d he tells me from his downtown Boulder office, with its stunning view of the jagged Flatiron Mountains. \u201cI decided I wanted to be a space scientist as a result.\u201d But his hopes for the project were dashed when Challenger, carrying the Comet Halley experiment, blew up just after launch on 28 January 1986, bringing the US space programme to a standstill. \u201cIt looked like everything we were doing in my work would be put off for years,\u201d recalls Stern. So within a month, he decided to go back to graduate school. \u201cIf there was ever going to be a time to become a scientist, this was probably it.\u201d \n               Building on the vision \n             Less than two years after completing his doctorate at the University of Colorado \u2014 which he did in just three years \u2014 Stern was hired to forge a planetary-science group at the SwRI's offices in San Antonio, Texas. The institute was already well known for its strong space-physics research group, but it wasn't on the map for planetary science. \u201cMost places you go, you're going to wait in line for 10 or 15 years to get your shot to lead,\u201d says Stern, \u201cbut at Southwest, there was nobody in line in front of me in planetary science. It was pretty much mine to make it \u2014 or not \u2014 which was simultaneously thrilling and terrifying.\u201d Although Stern acquired numerous research grants and won instrument proposals for space missions, he found San Antonio lacking key ingredients: local research universities and a community of planetary-science experts. Few recruits were interested in coming to the city. Then, at a 1993 banquet, Stern found himself seated next to three talented planetary scientists who had turned down offers to join the SwRI. Once the wine started to flow, they told him: \u201cIf you guys were in Boulder, or some place with a big research university, we'd be at Southwest.\u201d \u201cThat,\u201d says Stern, \u201cwas an epiphany.\u201d Stern became convinced that in order to build the landmark planetary-research group he envisaged, he would have to take a bold step. So he and his boss, magnetospheric scientist James Burch, went straight to SwRI president Martin Goland, who led the institute for 39 years until his death in 1997. Goland threw Stern out of his office twice before finally relenting. Eleven years later, the Boulder office has grown from two scientists to more than 40, with a deep reach in both planetary science and solar physics. To expand the institute, Stern drew hand-picked scientists from across the country. He lured Dan Durda, an asteroid expert, with the promise of conducting airborne astronomy in fighter jets. Stern and Durda have since perfected a high-performance telescope to study asteroids near the Sun from a vantage point 17,000 metres away. Since joining the SwRI at Boulder, Durda's research has branched out into areas that he says he would never have imagined possible. A cave diver in his spare time, Durda is now developing technologies for exploring under the ice of Jupiter's moon Europa through a partnership at the SwRI. For practice drills, Durda drops his robotic vehicle into deep sinkholes in Mexico. \u201cThere is no limit to what you can accomplish here,\u201d he says. Stern designed the department with characteristic calculation. One of his aspirations was to build an interdisciplinary department \u2014 funded by the soft money of research grants \u2014 that circumvented some of the classic problems of universities. Most importantly, the group is designed to prevent turf wars. By not allowing any given research group to sit together in one area, \u201cthere's no territory to claim, and people have to get up and walk past each other all the time\u201d, says Stern. The result is a place \u201cthat's really crackling with intellectual energy\u201d, says David Grinspoon, an SwRI scientist who studies the evolution of Earth-like planets. \u201cYou can't help but walk down the hall and before you know it get snared into some interesting project.\u201d \n               A wild success \n             Soft-money jobs are often viewed as transient positions. But the SwRI at Boulder hasn't lost a single scientist to recruitment, although many of its researchers have been offered positions at competitive institutes. \u201cIt's just been a success story wildly beyond what I ever thought would be possible,\u201d says Michael Shull, a University of Colorado astrophysicist and one of Stern's PhD advisers. \u201cI think people probably saw it as a stopping point for a couple of years and then on to another job, but they've all ended up staying.\u201d When he's not polishing his departmental efforts, Stern is busy working on comets and other objects in the icy realm beyond Pluto. This distant region some 5 billion to 8 billion kilometres from the Sun, known as the Kuiper belt, turns out to have swarms of frosty objects orbiting along with Pluto and its sister moon, Charon. \u201cIt's kind of the Solar System's attic, with all kinds of things stuffed away up there,\u201d says Stern, \u201clike a huge number of small and moderate-sized \u2018planets\u2019 that no one expected even 20 years ago.\u201d Stern is also working on NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter, set to reach the Moon at the end of 2008 or in early 2009. He is principal investigator for the ultraviolet spectrometer on the orbiter, as well as for the European Space Agency's Rosetta mission, which will orbit its comet destination beginning in 2014. And if all goes well, the New Horizons mission will fly by Pluto and Charon in 2015. \u201cI'm looking to have one heck of a bang-up decade in the teens,\u201d he says. However frenetic the pace, Stern also manages to be a husband and father of three. The first day we meet, he is rushing out the door to take his oldest daughter, Sarah, shopping for her first car. On weekends, he spends time individually with each of his children. His wife Carole says they've had to be creative to adapt to Stern's exhausting travel schedule, which often means he makes 40 to 50 trips a year. So what does Stern hope will turn up when New Horizons flies by Pluto? At a conference in 1993, during an early incarnation of Pluto mission studies, scientists placed their predictions about what mysteries Pluto might hold into sealed envelopes. They'll be opened when a spacecraft makes it to the planet. \u201cYou're not supposed to tell what your prediction is,\u201d says Stern. Breaking into his characteristic grin, he adds: \u201cBut I'm going to tell you mine.\u201d I lean forward, full of suspense. \u201cI wrote,\u201d he says, \u201cthat when we get to Pluto \u2014 and this is my entire prediction in two words \u2014 we would find \u2018something wonderful\u2019. We've never been to any two places that are the same in the Solar System. So we always learn something completely wonderful.\u201d \n                     Planetary science: Out on the edge \n                   \n                     Planetary science: Pluto's atmospheric surprise \n                   \n                     Security scare puts Pluto launch at risk \n                   \n                     Astronomers spy new 'planet' \n                   \n                     New object puts Pluto back in dock \n                   \n                     Alan Stern's website \n                   \n                     SwRI's Boulder office \n                   \n                     New Horizons mission to Pluto \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

David Cyranoski asks what went wrong. Asking Malaysian researchers what happened to their country's flagship science project, known as the BioValley, is a confusing experience. Some claim it is still under development. Others say it never existed. Many are simply unwilling to talk about it. But this was always a difficult project to pin down. Launched in May 2003, the BioValley was one of the final initiatives of Malaysia's strongman prime minister, Mahathir bin Mohamad, who stepped down from power a few months later. Incorporating three new research institutes and costing some US$160 million, the BioValley was meant to attract biotech companies to a centralized hub that would offer cheap rent, good telecommunications infrastructure and access to the country's lush biodiversity \u2014 a potential source of new drugs and other useful products. But even after its launch, it was hard to obtain concrete details about the BioValley. Aside from the plans drawn up by famed Japanese architect Kisho Kurokawa, the project was shrouded in mystery. By now, the 80-hectare campus in Dengkil, south of Kuala Lumpur, should have been nearing completion. Instead, the site lies empty. And official documents reveal that, earlier this year, the BioValley quietly morphed into the BioNexus, a much less ambitious scheme comprising just one new institute in Dengkil, and two other \u2018centres of excellence\u2019 built around existing labs elsewhere. All this is in marked contrast to developments in neighbouring Singapore, the city-state that nestles at the tip of peninsular Malaysia. There, a formidable biomedical research hub, the Biopolis, positively bustles with activity. \n               Problematic past \n             On the face of it, the disparity is puzzling. Singapore and Malaysia have much in common \u2014 their populations have a similar ethnic mix, both have governments with an authoritarian streak, and both see biotechnology as a springboard for future economic growth. Malaysia, in particular, wants to decrease its heavy reliance on the electronics industry and the production of palm oil. But while Singapore has recognized that scientific success means aggressively recruiting top talent regardless of nationality, race or creed, Malaysia's biotech push has been hampered by a legacy of ethnic strife, its hands tied by an educational policy designed to favour its ethnic Malay majority. The BioValley is just the most conspicuous feature in a landscape of failed effort. Elsewhere, flashy new labs remain largely unused, some of them led by people without proper scientific credentials. And in a culture in which criticism of authority is taboo, these problems don't look remotely near resolution. One senior political figure (who, like most of the people interviewed for this article, did not want his name mentioned) complains that the BioValley \u201cwas all about fancy buildings and real-estate development\u201d. Mahathir and his acolytes seemed to assume that researchers would come pouring into shiny new centres bearing the label \u2018biotechnology\u2019. It was a naive view, suggest foreign observers familiar with the Malaysian scientific scene. \u201cWith no history in biotechnology, and little industrial presence, the risk is very high,\u201d says Keiichi Kiyota, president of the Tokyo-based Nimura Genetics Solutions, one of very few foreign companies with research activities in Malaysia. \u201cThe greatest problem is the lack of manpower,\u201d he adds. Given this dearth of talent, Malaysian science can ill afford the brain drain that sees many young scientists, particularly those from the nation's Chinese and Indian minorities, leave the country. It's easy to see why, given that the dice are loaded against them. \u201cThe \u2018Malays first\u2019 policy holds them back,\u201d says biochemist Barry Halliwell, who heads the National University of Singapore's graduate school. \u201cIt does Singapore a good favour, as many come here.\u201d Last year, for instance, 128 students with straight A grades were denied access to medical school in Malaysia, while less qualified candidates were accepted. The excluded students were all non-Malay. The \u2018Malays first\u2019 policy has its origins in the race riots of 1969, which were sparked by the Malay majority's resentment of the Malaysian Chinese community's economic successes. Given the bitter memories of this conflict, some researchers back the policy of granting privileged opportunities to Malays. \u201cOtherwise people would become second-class citizens in their own country and you'd have a time bomb on your hands,\u201d says Salleh Mohammed Nor, former director of the Forest Research Institute of Malaysia in Kepong, near Kuala Lumpur, and now president of the Malaysian Nature Society. In the early 1970s, the government made a concerted effort to promote the interests of the Malay majority. In 1975, for example, the Malay language \u2014 Bahasa Malaysia \u2014 replaced English as the standard language of education. But critics say that this policy has damaged Malaysia's education system by failing to reward merit. \u201cAll vice-chancellors are appointed by the government without any kind of search committee,\u201d says one former University of Malaya researcher. \u201cIt's all favouritism.\u201d \n               Empty labs \n             Even when new labs have been built, they've failed to make much impact. The Technology Park Malaysia near Kuala Lumpur, for instance, hosts a government-sponsored institute that was supposed to act as a magnet for biotech companies. When  Nature  visited the two-year-old facility in late June, its high-performance liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry instruments lay idle \u2014 and only two research staff were present, huddled by a computer. Malaysia has unemployed graduates, but many don't have the requisite skills, including English ability, says an administrator at the park. \u201cGood people go overseas,\u201d he adds. This failure to embrace the international language of science is symptomatic of a general detachment of Malaysia's research system from the world scene. For most Malaysian researchers, publications in international peer-reviewed journals do not seem to be a priority. \u201cPeople here don't seem to publish much, apart from in workshop and conference proceedings,\u201d says one visiting ecologist. The country has also attracted few foreign researchers. Pay is low and there are few postdoctoral students to work with unless you bring your own. \u201cThere is nobody here who really understands what I am doing apart from my students,\u201d says a foreign researcher who is in Malaysia for family reasons. \u201cPeople in my department are perpetually putting obstacles in my way.\u201d Again, the contrast with Singapore is stark. Researchers there have high pay and high status, and the government has cast its net wide to bring in top scientific talent. Of the 35 principal investigators at the Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology, the country's premier research centre, only one is Singaporean. \u201cIf people have brains, I'll borrow them,\u201d declares Philip Yeo, who chairs A * STAR, the country's main science funding agency. In theory, Malaysia's leaders recognize the need to emulate Singapore's hiring policies. In 1995, for instance, Mahathir initiated a five-year plan to recruit 5,000 foreign researchers a year. But the scheme attracted just 94 scientists, and 24 of them were returning Malaysians. By 2004, only one of these researchers remained in the country. This pattern of setting and then failing to meet grandiose targets was common in the Mahathir era. So it should perhaps come as no surprise that the BioValley never made it off the drawing board. Its humbler successor \u2014 the BioNexus \u2014 is based around existing labs specializing in agricultural biotechnology, genomics and molecular biology. The single new centre will focus on pharmaceuticals and nutraceuticals. The BioNexus is part of the national biotechnology policy that was unveiled in April this year, which is supposed to remedy previous failings. A new organization, the Malaysian Biotechnology Corporation, is chaired by Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi and will provide tax breaks and matching grants to biotechnology companies. Its stated goal is to promote projects that can gain \u201cinternational recognition\u201d. This toned-down and yet outward-looking approach seems to be part of a more realistic framework of education and science policies now being introduced. In Penang, for instance, the local government is establishing a research base that would include contract research activities in animal toxicology \u2014 which may be of interest to foreign companies. \u201cTests are cheaper here and the animal-rights issues are not as prominent,\u201d says Penang's mayor, Koh Tsu Khoon, who recognizes that investment in people will be essential. \u201cWe are building on brains rather than buildings,\u201d he says. \n               Rewarding merit \n             The central government is also taking steps to introduce more fundamental reforms. In 2003, English became the language of school instruction in maths and the sciences. Private universities have also been allowed \u2014 and are now providing opportunities for ethnic Chinese and Indian students who feel discriminated against by the state system. These include the Malaysian branch of Monash University, based near Melbourne in Australia. And officially, the rigid quotas used to enforce the \u2018Malays first\u2019 policy in higher education have given way to a merit-based system for allocating state university places. But without standardized state university entrance exams, some critics remain sceptical about the likelihood of real progress. Unless Malaysia is able to shed its legacy of ethnic favouritism, they are dubious about the nation's chances of competing with its neighbours in biotechnology. \u201cFrankly, while the government funds mostly Malays, it won't happen,\u201d says one foreign scientist based in Malaysia. \u201cThe government is putting a lot of money into biotech but I doubt that anything will come of it. I see a lot of white elephants.\u201d Next week's NatureJobs will include a feature on Malaysia's private universities. \n                     Malaysia plans 'red book' in its attempts to go green \n                   \n                     Malaysia puts biovalley under wraps \n                   \n                     Singapore: Filling Biopolis \n                   \n                     Malaysian National Biotechnology Policy \n                   \n                     Malaysian National Biotechnology and Bioinformatics Network \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

But by combining their twin passions of chemistry and history, Jim and Jenny Marshall are now running an acclaimed project in science education. Alexandra Witze reports. Not every honeymoon turns into a scholarly project. But that's what happened when Jenny Marshall told her husband, chemist Jim Marshall, that she'd like to spend the summer after their wedding visiting European sites of chemical history. Six years later, that unusual honeymoon trip has spawned an unparalleled historical investigation. From their home in Texas, the Marshalls travel across Europe every summer to the places where various chemical elements were discovered. They have amassed hundreds of photographs, original documents and many colourful anecdotes \u2014 from boating along the coast of Norway in search of thorium, to navigating a muddy Transylvanian track to reach the original tellurium mine. Few, if any, have stood in quite so many spots where one of the elements was first discovered. \u201cIt makes the hairs rise on the back of your neck as you realize this is where history was made,\u201d says Jim. And as public interest in chemistry flags, the Marshalls see their work as a way to stimulate excitement about a field so rich in history. \u201cChemical education can be too junior-high-schoolish, with lots of loud bangs and prettily coloured gases,\u201d says Jim, \u201cand history can be awfully stuffy and plain and boring.\u201d \n               The human factor \n             The Marshalls' project is anything but, experts agree. \u201cIt gives this wonderful human reality to how chemistry became what it is today,\u201d says Alan Rocke, a historian of science at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio. \u201cScientists are sometimes too ready to ignore their history and the wider culture of their field, and I think that's a loss.\u201d Jim Marshall is determined to bridge that culture gap, lecturing regularly on the American Chemical Society's speaker circuit. His web page has become a staple resource for students working on projects about a particular element. And with his wife, he is compiling a DVD called  Rediscovery of the Elements , with photos and narratives about their quest, scheduled for release in 2007. Neither of the Marshalls is a professional historian. Jim teaches chemistry at the University of North Texas in Denton; Jenny is retired from teaching computer technology in local middle schools. Jim's research focus is on organic chemistry and materials science. During the 1980s he worked in industry, including a stint at Motorola that proved key to his leisure-time interests. At Motorola, Jim began collecting samples of as many elements as he could find. His industry contacts brought him some hard-to-find materials, including promethium from a nuclear reactor at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee. Marshall eventually gathered examples of every element from hydrogen to uranium \u2014 the latter represented by armour-penetrating depleted uranium from the tip of a missile stockpiled for the first Gulf War. The collection fills a wall of bookcases in the living room of the Marshalls' small townhouse. Glass bubbles filled with gas share the shelves with combustible phosphorus, submerged in oil. \u201cI'm afraid to dust because I don't know what will blow up,\u201d jokes Jenny. \n               Historic honeymoon \n             Given Jim's collection of elements, it seemed natural for Jenny to suggest visiting the sites at which some of them were discovered when the Marshalls made plans for their 1999 honeymoon. That first trip set the pattern: at each site, the Marshalls go forth with historical maps to find the place of interest, cameras to shoot it, and Global Positioning System receivers to fix the location. They then try to secure a new sample, often in the form of a mineral containing the element in question. These \u2018rediscovery\u2019 samples now enrich the original collection. In many cases, the rediscovery work brought to light stories that were known locally but not widely among historians of science. In Norway, the Marshalls visited mineralogist Alf Olav Larsen for a boat tour along the Langesund Fjord, south of Oslo. They motored along the craggy shoreline, just as Hans Esmark, a local pastor, had done in 1829 while hunting ducks. And they visited a rock outcrop from which Esmark may have chipped a shiny black mineral for the first time. The Swedish chemist J\u00f6ns Jakob Berzelius later named that mineral thorite after the Norse god of thunder, and isolated the element thorium from it. In Romania, the Marshalls travelled to the remote Fata Baii mine in search of tellurium. Franz-Joseph M\u00fcller von Reichenstein had identified the element in 1783, after puzzling over what he called a \u201c metallum problematum \u201d for several years. Working from descriptions written in the early nineteenth century by a British mineralogist, the Marshalls identified the original mine from which M\u00fcller von Reichenstein had obtained his materials. Local guides led them up a steep, muddy road into the Transylvanian forests, where they finally came across the entrance to the ancient mine, framed by rotting timbers. Not all the journeys were so arduous. For gallium, the Marshalls tracked down the former home of Paul-\u00c9mile Lecoq de Boisbaudran, whose family owned a wine business in the Cognac region of southwestern France. In a well equipped home laboratory, Boisbaudran used spectroscopy to identify an unknown element in an ore mined from the Pyrenees. It melted in his hand \u2014 a discovery that delighted Russian chemist Dmitri Mendeleev, who had predicted its properties with his recently developed periodic table of the elements. In some places, the Marshalls had to dig strenuously to hit pay dirt. In Germany, they eventually found that the laboratory where indium was first isolated is now a bathroom at the Freiberg Academy of Mining and Technology. In Paris, the mining school where chromium and beryllium were discovered had become a children's clothing shop. But even in such places, says Jim Marshall, \u201cyou can just smell the history\u201d. In other areas, the Marshalls ran into longstanding disputes over who should be properly credited with an element's discovery. Does the person who first isolated it deserve recognition? Or the one who realized its importance? Thallium, for instance, was first seen in spectroscopic experiments by William Crookes in London. But French physicist Claude-August Lamy cast an ingot of it the next year, grabbing public acclaim for the discovery until Crookes protested loudly and won joint credit. The Marshalls have uncovered new details of a similar misunderstanding over the discovery of vanadium. Historians of science know the tale of Andr\u00e9s Manuel del R\u00edo, a mineralogist in Mexico City who isolated vanadium from Mexican ore. He gave some samples of the new element to explorer Alexander von Humboldt, who took it to Europe and passed it to a French chemist for analysis. Upon testing, he became convinced that the Mexican element was chromium, which like the unknown ore also produced a range of brilliantly coloured salts. And on hearing the findings, del R\u00edo retracted his claim to have discovered a new element. Jim Marshall recreated the French tests in his kitchen sink and found that the chemist had ignored an obvious inconsistency in the colours of certain precipitates. Had he paid closer attention to the colours, Marshall argues, he would have realized that del R\u00edo's substance was in fact an unknown element. Instead, it took another three decades before vanadium was \u2018discovered\u2019 by a Swedish chemist. Fortunately, however, del R\u00edo did eventually get retrospective credit for his find. In another case, evidence amassed by the Marshalls may mean history needs rewriting. The discovery of radon is typically attributed to Friedrich Dorn, who in 1900 studied a gas built up inside capsules containing compounds of radium. But the original paper had been incorrectly cited for decades, and its contents drifted into obscurity. So the Marshalls went to Halle, Germany, to find the journal article. \n               Radon rewritten \n             Working from the original paper, they decided that Dorn hadn't correctly understood the \u201cemanation\u201d that built up. In the previous year, New Zealander Ernest Rutherford had made similar observations of a different isotope of radon emitted by a sample of thorium, and later to be dubbed thoron. Because he characterized the emanation fully, and placed it correctly in the periodic table, \u201cRutherford should be given credit for the discovery of radon\u201d, the Marshalls wrote in a 2003 paper (J. L. Marshall and V. R. Marshall  Bull. Hist. Chem.   28,  76\u201383; 2003). \u201cPersonally, I think they've made an absolutely convincing argument,\u201d says Rocke. But he warns that it may take some time for the textbook version of events to incorporate the lessons of the Marshalls' research. The Marshalls are pleased to have made an original contribution to the history of chemistry, but say that their favourite element remains one whose story is well known: radium, painstakingly isolated by Pierre and Marie Curie from 10 tonnes of uranium ore. Jenny speaks in hushed tones about the time she visited their laboratory, and was allowed to try on one of Marie's smocks. \u201cThe story's just so romantic,\u201d she says. There speaks a woman whose idea of a dream honeymoon is a voyage of chemical rediscovery. \n                     Islamic science: Rebuilding the past \n                   \n                     New Alexandria Library: A temple of knowledge \n                   \n                     Digital history \n                   \n                     James Marshall \n                   \n                     Rediscovery of the Elements \n                   \n                     WebElements periodic table \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},
{"file_id": "4361084a", "url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/4361084a", "year": 2005, "authors": [{"name": "Philip Ball"}], "parsed_as_year": "2006_or_before", "body": "Is there any fundamental reason to be fixated on water as the universal elixir of life? Philip Ball investigates. Where there's water, there's life. That, at least, is what our experience on Earth has taught us, and when it comes to searching for life on other worlds, NASA seems determined to follow the water. But is it right to see water as the sole medium for extraterrestrial life? Some think not. \u201cWater is a terrible solvent for life,\u201d says chemist Steven Benner of the University of Florida in Gainesville. Benner is one of a number of biochemists, planetary scientists and philosophers who are trying to find out whether water is in some sense \u2018fine-tuned\u2019 for life. It is a pertinent question. Scientists today are searching for extraterrestrial life wherever they can, from the subsoil of Mars to planets orbiting other stars. So far they have found nothing. But are they looking in the right places? If Benner is right, perhaps they have become too fixated on chasing water. Benner led the case for the prosecution earlier this year at a meeting in Varenna, Italy. There, researchers faced up to what many of them consider to be their biggest challenge. How can we even begin to discuss the relationship between water and life when we have only one example \u2014 life on Earth. And more to the point, can the problem be dealt with in a rigorous, scientific manner? For Benner the answer to the latter question is yes. He argues that it is possible to investigate experimentally whether water is essential for life. He hopes to prove that a type of biochemistry can occur without water. \u201cWe are working to create alternative darwinian systems based on fundamentally different chemistries,\u201d he says. \u201cWe are using different solvent systems as a way to get a precursor for life on Earth.\u201d The notion of redesigning life's chemistry has become central to the emerging discipline of synthetic biology, which has among its long-term objectives the aim of creating entire cells from scratch, perhaps with a different chemical basis from that of existing organisms. Benner points out that water is generally not a good solvent for doing organic chemistry \u2014 which is, in the end, what life is all about. For one thing, water is rather reactive, tending to split apart the bonds that link the building blocks of biomolecules together. It readily breaks peptide bonds, for example, as well as many of the bonds in nucleic acids, such as RNA. \u201cThe structure of RNA screams \u2018I did not arise in water!\u2019\u201d Benner asserts. He says that in about four out of five cases, synthetic organic chemists will avoid using water as a solvent. \n               Creative force \n             But of course organic chemists aren't usually trying to create life. Water has many properties that seem indispensable for the functioning of proteins and cells. It is an excellent solvent for ions, for example \u2014 crucial for nerve signalling, enzymatic processes, biomineralization and the behaviour of DNA. It is also a master of weak intermolecular interactions such as hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic forces. The latter play a central role in protein folding and protein\u2013protein interactions, whereas the former often act as bridges between protein binding sites and their substrates. And water's ability to absorb and lose heat without undergoing a large temperature change provides thermal cushioning, shielding cells and organisms from wild temperature swings. No other known liquid combines all of these properties. But does a life-supporting solvent need them all? Are any of water's unique properties essential, and are any of its essential properties unique? To assess whether water is somehow \u2018special\u2019 as a biological solvent, we need to understand the basic requirements for life 1 . Proteins and nucleic acids rely on weak intermolecular interactions to organize and pass chemical information around \u2014 to transfer genetic instructions, for instance. It could be argued that general properties such as this will be needed for a \u2018chemistry of life\u2019, even when the building blocks are not proteins or nucleic acids. But these familiar building blocks may themselves not need water to function. \u201cI think it is perfectly possible that at least elements of relevant biochemistry can be persuaded to work in a completely non-aqueous environment,\u201d says physicist John Finney at University College London. Finney points to evidence that enzymes can work in \u2018dry\u2019 air, where they hold on to only the barest coatings of water molecules, and even in non-aqueous solvents 2 . Most natural enzymes cannot fold into their compact, active forms without being immersed in water. But even that limitation might not be fundamental. A team led by Annelise Barron and Ishwar Radhakrishnan at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois, has recently found that molecules called peptoids, which are structurally very similar to peptides, can fold into compact forms in pure methanol. Another way to explore the relationship between water and life is to modify water's molecular structure or properties until the liquid state itself begins to change. \u201cKnowing which properties of water are particularly sensitive to its structure can help to show how fine-tuned for life the liquid properties are,\u201d says Ruth Lynden-Bell, a theoretical chemist at Queen's University Belfast, UK, who co-chaired the Varenna meeting. Lynden-Bell and her co-workers have used computer simulations to model changes in water's properties. They found that if the bond angle in H 2 O was 90\u00b0, rather than 104.5\u00b0 as in the real molecule, or if the hydrogen bonds were about 15% weaker, the three-dimensional network of hydrogen bonds \u2014 crucial to the liquid's unique properties \u2014 would be severely disrupted or fall to pieces 3 , 4 . Asking such \u2018what if\u2019 questions might seem strange to biologists and chemists, but it is far more common in cosmology or physics. For cosmologists, the physical Universe seems to be precariously fine-tuned to make life possible 5 . For example, the fine-structure constant, which determines the strength of electromagnetic interactions, is not fixed by any known fundamental theory; and yet if it was ten times larger, stable atoms could not exist. Unlike physics, of course, biochemistry adapts to its environment, which is why the participants in Varenna generally agreed that life on Earth is adapted to water rather than the other way round. \u201cLife on Earth itself is fine-tuned to water \u2014 a consequence of it evolving in close association with the medium,\u201d says Finney. \u201cTo put it the other way is perhaps to put the cart before the horse.\u201d He adds that \u201cthe fine-tuning argument with respect to water is a far more complex problem than that in astrophysics. Without knowing what aspects of water are important, I suspect we are doing little more than speculating.\u201d \n               Out of this world \n             Benner wants to use experiments to move beyond these abstract discussions. He sees several alternatives to water 6 . Ammonia, which is liquid between \u221278 \u00b0C and \u221233 \u00b0C at 1 atmosphere pressure, will dissolve many organic compounds and can form hydrogen bonds. It is also relatively common in the cosmos: there is liquid ammonia in the clouds of Jupiter, for example. Benner considers water\u2013ammonia mixtures, which may exist in some cold extraterrestrial environments such as beneath the surface of Saturn's moon Titan, as another promising candidate. Then there is formamide, which is liquid over a wide range of temperatures and pressures, dissolves salts and has hydrophobic-like effects. Formamide might be present below the surface on Mars. But Benner does not rule out more exotic possibilities, such as liquid nitrogen or supercritical liquid hydrogen on gas-giant planets such as Saturn, Uranus and Neptune. Or perhaps hydrocarbons such as liquid methane on Titan. \u201cOrganic reactivity in hydrocarbon solvents is no less versatile than in water,\u201d he says. Does widening the search for extraterrestrial life to places that don't have water make sense? The Cassini-Huygens space probe showed in January that Titan may have river-beds (if not actual rivers) carved from liquid hydrocarbons. And in March the detection of reflected light from two Jupiter-like extrasolar planets by the Spitzer Space Telescope 7  marked the first step towards analysing their chemistry remotely. But NASA's quest for habitable planets remains focused on water. In 2008 it intends to launch the Kepler Photometer, which will search for Earth-like planets by looking for evidence of their transit across the faces of parent stars. At a much later date, the agency hopes to launch two space-based telescopes that will form the Terrestrial Planet Finder (TPF) mission. These will detect and analyse reflected light from other planets. The gaze of both Kepler and the TPF will be firmly fixed on the \u2018habitable zone\u2019 of stars, where liquid water could exist, potentially overlooking worlds that are habitable by non-aqueous life forms. Benner is not waiting around for these space missions to find extraterrestrial life in places with or without water. He is convinced that the time is ripe to explore more exotic life forms in the laboratory. But that, he says, requires a different mindset from the one that currently guides chemical research and funding. Benner is participating in a US National Academies panel funded by NASA that is looking at possible alternative chemistries for life, and which he hopes will identify research directions that funding agencies can pursue. He believes that researchers should aim high \u2014 to create life forms that do not reproduce the chemistry that is found on Earth. In other words, if we can't easily get to other worlds, we should build them here. \n                     Titanic life may bloom without water \n                   \n                     Light from alien planets confirmed \n                   \n                     Exoplanet may have been pictured at last \n                   \n                     Do you believe in life on Mars? \n                   \n                     Exobiology: It's life...isn't it? \n                   \n                     Earth-like planets may be more rare than thought \n                   \n                     \u2018Water of life\u2019 meeting \n                   \n                     National Academies Project: \u2018The Limits of Organic Life of Planetary Systems\u2019 \n                   \n                     NASA PlanetQuest homepage \n                   \n                     Terrestrial Planet Finder \n                   \n                     Kepler mission \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

But the genomes of our other primate relatives will help to reveal a whole lot more, says Carina Dennis. \u201cIt's a dream come true,\u201d says Caro-Beth Stewart of the chimp genome. The evolutionary biologist from the University at Albany in New York State never imagined that primate genomes would be sequenced in her lifetime. She can barely contain her excitement, not only over the draft chimp genome sequence 1  but also about those of the other primates, including the orang-utan and rhesus macaque, which will soon be available. Stewart is one of many who hope that looking at several primate genomes will help answer fundamental questions about our own evolution and that of other primates (see graphic, overleaf). What underlies the differences between humans, apes and the other primates? How did the physical structure and content of our ancestors' genomes enable primates to evolve the way they have? Will this give us more insight into how evolution itself operates? Chimps, our closest living relatives, are a great starting point. But our genomes are too much alike to get meaningful answers to many of these questions. \u201cIt's frustrating that humans and chimps are so similar,\u201d says Andrew Clark of Cornell University in Ithaca, New York. It's difficult to tell whether a DNA sequence in humans that is missing in chimps was really added during human evolution or has simply been lost in the chimp lineage. Another problem is that it is hard to be sure straight away that any differences found are significant. \u201cYou find a difference that you think could be very exciting, but it could just turn out to be a natural variant within one species,\u201d says Ajit Varki at the University of California, San Diego. Chimps, like humans, differ genetically from each other, although the extent is debatable. More chimps from different subspecies must be sequenced to capture the full extent of sequence diversity. And the chimp genome sequence is still only a draft. To ensure that the differences found are real, the chimp sequence needs to be improved to match the polished \u2018finished\u2019 standard of the human genome. This is now under way. Even so, researchers need other primate genomes if they are to address the question of which genetic changes are unique to humans or chimps (see  The chimpanzee and us ). The rhesus macaque, an Old World monkey, will be the first available \u2014 a preliminary assembly of its genome sequence was released into the public databases earlier this year and an improved version is expected by the end of the year. The push to sequence its genome stems from its popularity in biomedical research 2 . It will help researchers figure out whether the differences arose in the lineages leading to modern chimps or humans after they split from their last common ancestor approximately 6 million years ago. But although the macaque is a useful reference, it is not ideal for identifying genetic changes that happened after the human\u2013chimp split, as it diverged from a common ancestor some 25 million years ago. \u201cThere have been so many changes, it will be harder to tell what's gone on,\u201d says Varki. To better understand how the human genome has evolved, researchers want to look at a primate that is sufficiently different from humans and chimps, but which shares a more recent common ancestor. \u201cThe obvious one is the orang-utan,\u201d says Varki. The orang-utan, a great ape like the chimpanzee, diverged from a common ancestor with chimps and humans approximately 12 million years ago. Its genome is currently being sequenced and a draft is expected early next year. \u201cIdentifying sequences common to human, chimp and orang-utan, but different in the rhesus monkey, would provide valuable clues to the genomic features distinguishing great apes from other primates,\u201d says Eddy Rubin, director of the Joint Genome Institute in Walnut Creek, California. But for others, the most exciting primate genome to follow chimp will be that of the gorilla. This is our next closest primate relative, and some parts of the gorilla genome are closer to humans than is the chimp genome 3 . \u201cThe sequence will help us understand how the species formed that went on to become gorilla, chimp and humans,\u201d says Svante P\u00e4\u00e4bo of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany. Generally speaking, the closer a primate sequence is to human, the more useful it is for figuring out more recent, human-specific traits. And the more species that can be compared the better. If orang-utan, gorilla and chimp were all identical at one DNA position and humans were different, for example, then geneticists could be quite confident that that change happened in the most recent history of the human lineage. \u201cWe expect to start sequencing the gorilla in October this year,\u201d says Jane Rogers of the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute near Cambridge, UK. A draft assembly should be available in a couple of years, she adds. \n               Back to our roots \n             While some researchers are working on the the youngest shoots of the primate family tree, others are delving at the roots, to understand what the earliest primate genomes were like. To this end molecular palaeontologists are keen to sequence representatives from each of the major primate lineages. The sequencing of the marmoset, a New World monkey, has just begun. \u201cI would also like the lemur sequence,\u201d says Asao Fujiyama of the National Institute of Informatics in Tokyo, Japan, who was part of the team that sequenced the first chimpanzee chromosome last year 4 . The suborder of primates to which lemurs belong arose earlier than the branch leading to monkeys and apes. \u201cMy interest is to trace how modern human chromosomes have evolved from our ancestor,\u201d he says. David Haussler of the University of California, Santa Cruz, and his collaborators want to peer even further back in time 5 . They are analysing sequence data from across the animal kingdom to reconstruct the genome of the ancestor of placental mammals, which lived around the time of the dinosaurs more than 75 million years ago. \u201cOur goal is to reconstruct the complete history of the DNA changes from the placental ancestor to the modern human,\u201d says Haussler. Reconstructing this genome and comparing it with the human sequence will make the key genetic changes in our evolution from that ancestor much easier to see, he explains. \u201cAdditional primate genomes will help fill in the missing details.\u201d His team is now assembling the first draft of the ancestor's reconstructed DNA sequence and, although preliminary, the results show that it is at least computationally feasible, says Haussler. Figure 1 Clambering back up the tree will add to the picture of how genomes evolve and how the genes within them work. The gibbon, which shares a common ancestor with the great apes, has a most peculiar genome, according to Todd Disotell, a molecular anthropologist at New York University. Its chomosomes seem to have changed and evolved faster than those of other apes. \u201cIts genome looks like it has been put in a blender,\u201d says Disotell. It seems to have virtually the same DNA content as humans and chimps, but all churned up. It will be interesting to find out whether the functions of genes change in their new chromosomal locations, says Disotell. William Murphy of Texas A&M University is also excited by the genomic clues thrown out by gibbons. His team has reconstructed the chromosomal architecture of a mammalian ancestral genome by comparing stretches of genomic sequence from eight very different mammals. The results suggest that stretches of duplicated sequence promote chromosomal rearrangements. In turn, these contribute to genetic changes that can lead to new species. If the same holds true in the gibbon, we might get a better handle on the mechanism of genome rearrangement, says Murphy. When a chromosome breaks and rejoins, clues to the mechanism and molecular machinery involved can be left behind in the sequence. Because the gibbon genome contains so many rearrangements, it might be easier to identify the tell-tale footprints of the machinery involved. Earlier this year, the US National Human Genome Research Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, announced it would fund the sequencing of small portions of the gibbon genome to capture some of these rearrangement sites. Structural changes like these may have been important in driving human evolution. The draft chimp genome revealed that 2.7% of its genome differs from humans because of duplications, compared with 1.2% differing at single base-pairs 6 . Structural changes such as duplications are often hotspots for the birth of new genes. But right now it's impossible to tell whether single base changes or structural variations have had the biggest influences on how we evolved. \u201cI couldn't hazard a guess,\u201d says Evan Eichler of the University of Washington in Seattle. The emerging picture is of primate genomes that have been shaped in a variety of ways. Some changes were single-base alterations; others were \u2018structural variations\u2019, such as insertions, deletions or duplications of sequence. And, periodically, a transposable element \u2014 a parasitic DNA sequence \u2014 would infect and spread through the genome, tending to pool in the non-coding regions. In addition, a whole genome doesn't change at an even pace; comparisons of many primate sequences will reveal how different genomic regions have evolved at different rates. \n               Beyond evolution \n             Primate genomes can give us much more than a fascinating history lesson. They are, for example, providing valuable insights into human disease. Rubin has devised a method for comparing similar genomes and picking out functional genes and control sequences from \u2018junk\u2019 DNA. Dubbed \u2018phylogenetic shadowing\u2019, the technique has let him compare numerous different primate DNA sequences (including human), and to spot stretches of DNA that have remained broadly the same throughout relatively recent evolution. This suggests that the correct sequence of these regions is so important for the survival of the animal that evolution cannot tinker with it. Rubin's team first used this approach to discover primate-specific stretches of sequence that control the production of the protein apolipoprotein A, whose faulty regulation is implicated in susceptibility to atherosclerosis 7 . They are now looking for important regulators of the gene for the low-density lipoprotein receptor, which is involved in controlling blood cholesterol. The good news, says Rubin, is that only a handful of carefully chosen primate genomes are needed to identify the most interesting genetic elements. The phylogenetic spread that would capture most of the genetic diversity in primates, he adds, would be \u2014 in addition to human \u2014 the Old World monkeys rhesus macaque and colobus and the New World monkeys marmoset, titi and spider monkey. Molecular biologists aren't the only ones who hope to benefit from the chimp genome. The ancestors of most primates \u2014 unlike those of humans \u2014 seem to have left behind few fossils (see  First fossil chimpanzee ), probably because they died in environments unfavourable to fossilization. \u201cWe are very fortunate that humans had the decency to evolve in good places for preserving fossils,\u201d says David Penny of Massey University in Palmerston North, New Zealand. This means that there are lingering questions over when certain primate lineages diverged, the size of populations at the time of the splits, and phylogenetic relationships among the more than 60 genera of living primates 8 . More primate genome sequences will help to calibrate the times of divergence and resolve phylogenetic discrepancies. And genome sequences have limitations. \u201cYou can only learn so much from the genome sequence,\u201d says Penny. To make sense of the sequence differences between primates, researchers need information on the expression of genes in different tissues and the genetic variation in family pedigrees and different populations. Obtaining samples from these endangered animals in an ethical way is hard, say researchers (see  page 27 ). \u201cThere are bits of dead gorillas in freezers but they're not great to use,\u201d says Rogers. With wild apes threatened with extinction, it is imperative to collect blood and tissue from captive populations and from animals that die in the wild. \u201cThe opportunity is fast disappearing,\u201d says Eichler. \u201cWe have only a short window to act in.\u201d \n                     News@nature special \n                   \n                     Chimp web focus \n                   \n                     Flores man web focus \n                   \n                     Human genome web focus \n                   \n                     Sanger Centre \n                   \n                     Washington University Genome Sequence Centre \n                   \n                     Whitehead Institute \n                   \n                     Baylor College of Medicine Human Genome Sequencing Center \n                   This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-Non-Commercial-Share Alike licence ( http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/ ), which permits distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.

But in many countries, tough retirement laws make staying in the lab a challenge. Laura Bonetta reports. When Jack Strominger and his wife moved to an apartment just a 15-minute walk from the lab, Strominger thought he would be able to do his reading and writing from home. Yet he rarely makes it out of the office before six in the evening. The head of a 14-member group at Harvard University, Strominger has an ambitious research agenda by any standards, but even more so because he turned 80 this month. The immunologist is best known for his work with Don Wiley on the proteins that the body uses to distinguish its own cells from foreign ones. But these days, he enjoys applying his years of experience to new problems, such as autoimmune diseases. \u201cMy goal has always been to stay original,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen I can't do that any more, maybe I will spend more time riding horses at our farm.\u201d Eighty-year-old Janet Rowley, a cancer geneticist at the University of Chicago, has also toyed with the idea of slowing down. \u201cI was thinking of going part-time but wanted to see what would happen to my latest grant,\u201d she says. \u201cWe got funding for another three years, so now I can postpone that decision.\u201d Rowley made her mark by discovering that pieces of chromosomes in cancer patients can break off and join on to other chromosomes. She had something of a late start in research, having worked as a clinician for several years and then as a part-time researcher while raising four sons. But she has more than made up for lost time. \u201cI have had a front-row seat in a never-ending suspense story,\u201d she says. Such tales are not unique. Many researchers continue to lead active and innovative research programmes in their 70s and 80s, quashing the notion that science is a young person's game. \u201cAge matters, but not that much. And it matters less in the life sciences than in physics,\u201d says Paula Stephan. An economist at Georgia State University, Atlanta, Stephan co-wrote a book in 1992 called  Striking the Mother Lode in Science: The Importance of Age, Place and Time , in which she examined the relationship between age and productivity based on publication record. There may even be some advantage to age. \u201cIt can maybe help you focus on larger problems,\u201d says Joseph Gall of the Carnegie Institution in Baltimore, Maryland, who at 77 still works at the bench all day. \u201cIf you feel you have made your mark, you can sit back and look at the bigger picture. In a way that is what happened with our work on the Cajal body.\u201d First described more than 100 years ago, this cell structure was brought out of obscurity in the past decade by Gall's work showing that it is the assembly site in cells for key proteins that modify RNA molecules to make them function. \n               Generation gap \n             But there are drawbacks too. \u201cIt is definitely harder to recruit students and postdocs,\u201d says Strominger. \u201cBut it is understandable. My grandchildren are almost the age of my students. It is harder to relate to your grandfather.\u201d Writing grants can also begin to get tedious after so many years. At 86, Herman Eisen, an immunologist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Cambridge, decided to let his last federal grant run out. \u201cIt was unrealistic to keep writing grants,\u201d he says. \u201cFor one thing, I had stopped taking postdocs because I could not commit to them for several years. And also on some level it felt embarrassing; I would be competing with former postdocs and students.\u201d But Eisen is not out of work. MIT let him keep his lab space, where he continues to plug away at the bench aided by a part-time assistant and a succession of undergraduate students. \u201cIt is still very fascinating. The problems I choose today are precisely those that appeal to me a lot,\u201d Eisen says. The lure of finding one more piece of the puzzle is what keeps thoughts of leaving research at bay for many ageing scientists. \u201cI can't think of a day that I did not want to come to the lab. Maybe when my papers start getting rejected, I will start thinking about doing something else,\u201d says Gall. Scientists in the United States can continue working as long as they can get grants because the country did away with mandatory retirement in 1994. Australia, New Zealand and some provinces of Canada have followed suit. But in many European countries and in Japan, scientists working at government-funded universities have little choice but to retire sometime between the ages of 60 and 70, regardless of their level of productivity. As a result, the United States has benefited from the influx of several superstar foreign scientists trying to escape this fate. Swiss Nobel laureate Kurt W\u00fcthrich's move to the Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla, California, in 2001 caused a scandal in the European press. Five years before reaching retirement age, which is 65 in Switzerland, W\u00fcthrich tried to negotiate a five-year extension to his appointment with the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich. \u201cBut on very friendly terms, my request was denied,\u201d says W\u00fcthrich, who will be 67 in October. As a result, he accepted one of the many job offers he had obtained abroad. The situation quickly changed in 2002 when W\u00fcthrich received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry. The Swiss parliament passed an extraordinary law to let him keep his post in Switzerland, although he had already set up shop in the United States. W\u00fcthrich, who now splits his time between the two positions, says that the new law has not yet helped other Swiss academics. Perhaps one reason for the resistance to change, suggests W\u00fcthrich, is that senior scientists in Europe acquire many benefits that are difficult for universities to maintain if a scientist is not productive. \u201cMy chair in Zurich carried a non-competitive endowment for the salaries and consumables for a team of eight scientists and technicians. If I stop being productive at 55 but last my time until 65, this huge investment is not well used,\u201d he says. \n               Cold shoulder \n             Japanese scientists face a similar plight. \u201cThe system in Japan is considered to be based on achievement, but the reality is not so,\u201d says Yoshiaki Ito, who at 63 traded in his retirement from Kyoto University for a position at the Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology in Singapore. According to Ito, Japanese colleagues who want to continue working past retirement age have to scramble to find positions at private institutes or companies, or head abroad. \u201cI never thought of stopping work. My work is going so well right now,\u201d says Ito, who believes he is hot on the heels of a genetic pathway fundamental to cancer. \u201cTo set a mandatory retirement age at 63 is cruel. It is like cutting your head off in the middle of your career.\u201d In Germany, the situation is a little better, as retired professors can apply for grants, provided their home institution lets them have some lab space to continue working. But that too is far from ideal, according to immunologist Klaus Rajewsky, who left the University of Cologne in 2001 to take up a post at Harvard University. \u201cThe last years working in Cologne were often psychologically depressing. My colleagues, who were same age as I, were wondering how to deal with retirement. Some would talk about trying to get a place in someone else's lab to keep working,\u201d recalls Rajewsky. \u201cI came to the United States and had a contract without a time limit and all those discussions came to an end. It was a relief.\u201d \n               Forced out \n             Scientists in Europe and Japan are sceptical about whether their universities will do away with mandatory retirement anytime soon. At the University of Tokyo, the decision to extend the retirement age from 60 to 65 by 2013 drew fire because many felt it would slow opportunities for new faculty appointments (see  Nature 407, 550; 2000 ). The end of mandatory retirement in the United States had raised similar concerns, but Ronald Ehrenberg, professor of industrial and labour relations at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, says they are misplaced. \u201cThe consensus is that people who would have retired before age 70 in the absence of mandatory retirement are continuing to retire, and of the people who were constrained by mandatory retirement, some are staying longer,\u201d he says. \u201cPeople who stay past age 70 tend to be those individuals most driven by work and most productive, especially in sciences where you have a system in which you have to generate research grants to do your work.\u201d Pierre Chambon, founder of the Institute of Genetics and Molecular and Cellular Biology in Strasbourg, thinks that judging a person by his or her age makes little sense. \u201cSome people get old faster than others,\u201d says the biologist, who had to retire from the institute's directorship in 2002. \u201cOne should not throw away active people who can be useful to society.\u201d This attitude is not unique to scientists. In May 2005, the UK-based HSBC Bank published a survey of some 12,000 people in ten different countries to gauge attitudes to ageing and retirement. The report,  The Future of Retirement , claims that 80% of people worldwide want to scrap mandatory retirement, a trend partly attributed to the increase in life expectancy. Chambon managed to find a way to keep working, albeit on a voluntary basis, by founding an institute that is affiliated with the University of Strasbourg but that operates in a semi-private way. \u201cIt's like telling someone who has always climbed mountains: \u2018Now, you cannot climb mountains any more, not even walk in the mountains\u2019,\u201d says 74-year-old Chambon. \u201cI am not pretending I can climb the peaks as fast as I did 20 years ago, but I still want to be in the mountains.\u201d \n                     Age wins as Tokyo revamps retirement rules \n                   \n                     Demographic shifts \n                   \n                     Capping active volcanoes \n                   \n                     Biology of ageing \n                   \n                     Life expectancy figures from the United Nations \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

But such experiments will need more than the skeleton crew now running the station. Tony Reichhardt reports. At a meeting in Annapolis, Maryland, last February to draw up a \u2018roadmap\u2019 for NASA's use of the International Space Station, Terri Lomax, a research manager for the agency's exploration directorate, recounted the list of medical issues that worry doctors about sending astronauts on a 30-month round trip to Mars. She put up a chart showing that 588 of 607 space-shuttle crew had reported \u2018medical events\u2019 or symptoms during their flight. The implication was that nearly everyone got sick. Astronaut Ed Lu, sitting towards the back of the room, raised his hand. \u201cBut aren't most of those stuffy noses?\u201d he asked. Lomax conceded as much, then presented statistics on the deterioration of bone in orbit \u2014 astronauts don't want brittle bones when they land on Mars. Lu raised his hand again. He spent six months on the space station in 2003, and gained, not lost, bone mass. So had other recent space-station astronauts. The difference? They had a treadmill, so they could exercise to counter the debilitating effects of weightlessness. Lomax then moved on to radiation, maybe the biggest threat of all. She said more dosimeters were needed on the station to characterize the risk. Up shot Lu's hand. We already know about the radiation environment in space, he said. What we don't know is how it would affect interplanetary travellers \u2014 and studies on the station would not help, because it is shielded from the most dangerous radiation. The space station should be a unique place to do science, including the sort of biomedical testing needed before NASA sends astronauts to Mars. But some people question whether the right experiments are being planned, and if so, whether the station will be equipped to answer them. It's a key concern not just for astronauts, but for the $30-billion space station, which is still only half finished 21 years after design work began. Europe and Japan plan a mixed portfolio of physics, biology and materials science for their station modules, which they hope to see launched by 2010 (see  \u2018Stalled countdown\u2019 ) despite the space shuttle's current woes. But NASA, the project's main underwriter, has recently settled on human research as the top priority for the orbiting laboratory. Ever since 2004, when the White House announced plans to send people to the Moon and on to Mars, NASA has been reshaping its space-station research to support the new goal. Details of the Moon\u2013Mars programme are expected at the end of this month. Some in Congress want the agency to keep a percentage of station research for fundamental experiments in biology, physics and materials science. But biomedical studies are clearly the new focus. Speaking to a congressional committee in June, NASA's new administrator, Michael Griffin, listed the agency's priorities for space-station science: all involved either medical research on humans or work on life-support systems to keep people healthy in space. NASA also has a new \u2018bioastronautics roadmap\u2019, released in February, that outlines 45 risks to space travellers that need further study. John Charles, deputy chief scientist for bioastronautics at the Johnson Space Center near Houston, Texas, calls it \u201cour best collective guess\u201d on the hazards of going to Mars, from kidney stones to contaminated water. Some risks, such as the space sickness that afflicts two-thirds of shuttle astronauts, don't worry Rhea Seddon, assistant chief medical officer at the Vanderbilt Medical Group in Nashville, Tennessee, and a veteran of three shuttle missions. \u201cDo you research it to death?\u201d she asks, or simply administer the anti-nausea drug Phenergan, which works \u2014 although no one knows how. Other risks are more serious. Four might scupper a Mars expedition: radiation, bone deterioration, psychosocial problems, and how to provide medical care in a weightless spacecraft millions of miles from home. At least three can be researched partly or wholly on Earth. Psychosocial questions can be studied in analogous settings such as underwater habitats. NASA's radiobiology research has shifted to studies of ionizing radiation on animals at the Brookhaven National Laboratory in New York. And in-space medical care could be practised on the ground, with notable exceptions such as weightless surgery. Attempts to curb bone loss could benefit from research on the station \u2014 but how big a risk is it really? Based on recent astronauts' experience, Lu thinks diligent exercise will hold the problem at bay. Combining workouts with bisphosphonates, a class of drugs developed to treat osteoporosis, could be the answer. Not so fast, says James Pawelczyk, a Pennsylvania State University neurophysiologist who flew on a shuttle Spacelab mission in 1998. Research published by Thomas Lang of the University of California, San Francisco, based on data from 14 space-station astronauts, shows substantial loss of bone in the hip and a smaller loss in the spine as a result of long-term spaceflight (T. Lang  et al .  J. Bone Miner. Res.   19,  1006\u20131012; 2004). And even if some astronauts gain overall bone mass, loss of some kinds of bone tissue might weaken their limbs. Anecdotes aside, says Pawelczyk, bone loss remains a serious concern. Seddon agrees, and says this is one area where more research really is needed. \u201cEd Lu is probably willing to go to Mars tomorrow,\u201d she says. \u201cI wouldn't be.\u201d The station is a good place for such research, but there is one major problem: not enough test subjects. Today the station can accommodate just three long-term residents \u2014 the number that fit in the Russian Soyuz craft that doubles as a lifeboat. When the shuttle was grounded following the Columbia disaster, NASA cut the crew to two to save on resources. According to NASA's bioastronautics roadmap, addressing all 45 risks would require flying 200 test subjects on the station. Charles calls that \u201can embarrassing number, because it's way beyond the realm of possibility\u201d. So far there have been 26 long-term residents in five years. Attaching two Soyuzes to the station would raise the crew to six, but there is currently no timetable, nor funding, for doing so. And NASA's own replacement vehicle for the shuttle wouldn't be ready to operate as a six-person lifeboat until at least 2010. One solution is to supplement human data with animal studies. Earlier plans called for a large centrifuge, built by Japan, as part of a programme of gravitational biology research. But NASA is reportedly preparing to cut animal research from the station. Funding for the centrifuge and animal habitats will therefore be one of the most closely scrutinized items in the space-station research plan unveiled later this month. Seddon understands NASA's reluctance to send animals into space. They are expensive and difficult to house in weightlessness, and they complicate astronaut training. But they may be the only way to address one of NASA's top concerns about going to Mars. Lu, meanwhile, highlights a different worry. He wants to make absolutely sure the equipment works \u2014 particularly the life-support system that cleans the astronauts' air and filters their water. He knows from personal experience how commonly machines that work fine on Earth break down in space. If the air filtration on a Mars ship stops working, he says, \u201cyou're dead about two months out\u201d. That's the real problem for long-term human spaceflight, thinks Lu, more than stuffy noses or weak bones. Testing technology may end up as the station's final purpose. \u201cThe actual ship itself is the experiment,\u201d he says. \u201cI think that's really what the station has to offer.\u201d \n               Additional reporting by Jenny Hogan and David Cyranoski. \n             \n                     Science struggles to gain respect on the space station \n                   \n                     Tough decisions loom as funding crisis hits space-station research \n                   \n                     Cutbacks 'will cripple space station science' \n                   \n                     Shuttle special \n                   \n                     International Space Station \n                   \n                     NASA Bioastronautics Roadmap \n                   \n                     Institute of Medicine Interim Report on Bioastronautics Roadmap \n                   \n                     Space Station Biological Research Project \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Can we teach adult wounds the same trick, asks Meredith Wadman. It was alligators that first drew Mark Ferguson to study human scarring, but not for the reasons you might expect. In the late 1970s, he had become fascinated by cleft palate. Alligators were the obvious research subject: their embryos have palates, and develop in easily accessible eggs. But when Ferguson performed surgery on alligator embryos to mimic cleft palates, the creatures hatched with completely normal, unscarred mouths. \u201cAs a surgical model of cleft palate it was perfectly useless,\u201d says Ferguson. \u201cAs an observation of scar-free healing, it was of great scientific and clinical interest.\u201d Ferguson, who now researches wound healing at the University of Manchester, UK, was not the first to stumble across this phenomenon. As early as 1960 there were anecdotal reports that wounds made early in gestation in embryos of many species, including humans, heal rapidly and perfectly. Over the past 20 years, researchers have been probing the mysteries of this process in the hope of improving adult wound healing and perhaps even making scarless healing a reality. It's no trivial point: delayed wound healing in the US elderly, for instance, is estimated to cost more than $9 billion each year. \n               Growing realization \n             Such work has wider implications too. There are striking similarities between the mechanisms embryos use to heal wounds and those they use to knit their body parts together during normal development. Research is throwing light on these basic processes and what might go wrong with them to cause birth defects such as cleft palate. When adult skin is wounded, a blood clot quickly forms to stem the bleeding, then cells underneath move in for the repair job. Some of these cells, called fibroblasts, churn out a matrix of support proteins. Skin cells at the edge of the wound drag themselves over this to close the wound. As immune cells rush to the scene, the underlying connective tissue contracts, leading to scarring. Embryos do things very differently, says Paul Martin, a cell and developmental biologist at the University of Bristol, UK. A fruitfly embryo closing a wound rapidly assembles a cable of the protein actin in the \u2018skin\u2019 cells at the wound's edges. Contraction of this cable seems to pull the edges together much as a drawstring pulls a bag shut 1 . Once the edges meet, the cells reach out with thin extensions called filopodia, which interlock to seal the wound. Flies unable to make these cell extensions cannot close wounds completely 2 . Intriguingly, this tissue repair uses the same machinery used by embryos to close holes that normally arise as they build their bodies, says Martin. This makes sense, he says: embryos are in the business of building tissue, and wound healing is essentially a process of rebuilding what was damaged. To close a wound, he says, \u201call they do is reactivate the machinery they're using somewhere else in the body anyway\u201d. For example, a developing fruitfly embryo needs to zip up its outer skin as this grows over its back. This process, dubbed dorsal closure (see graphic), uses the same actin cable and filopodia mechanism. What's more, this mechanism is remarkably common across the animal kingdom, whether it's in an embryonic mouse knitting its eyelids shut or a worm fusing its outer surface. It is also thought that filopodia are critical for a human embryo to fuse its palate or the tube that forms its brain and spinal cord. \n               Wrong turning \n             When these events go wrong in humans, notes Martin, the consequences range from the serious, such as cleft palate, to the devastating, as in anencephaly, when a baby is born missing a large part of its brain and skull. So it is hoped that understanding the process better will mark a beginning in the long journey towards preventing this kind of problem. The evolutionary conservation of the healing mechanism means that researchers can study its basic biology easily in lab workhorses such as flies and mice. One focus is a signalling pathway between cells known as the JNK cascade, which plays a central role in skin-cell migration both after wounding and during normal development 3 . The genes switched on by this cascade are activated during dorsal closure in flies and within minutes in wounded rat embryos, in response, it is thought, to mechanical stress on cells. Biologists such as Martin would dearly love to know more about how to activate this signalling, to kick-start healing in chronic wounds such as diabetic leg ulcers. Recent findings that conserved genes also control skin repair once wounds are closed in flies and mammals offers another target for therapy 4 , 5 . For the moment, such treatments are still a distant dream. But there is one facet of embryonic wound healing that could have clinical relevance sooner: inflammation. Wounds in adults are red and inflamed, bristling with immune cells summoned by molecular signals from platelets that leak from damaged blood vessels. These signals are also thought to trigger the skin-cell migration and connective-tissue contraction that ultimately lead to scarring. The inflammatory response is a robust one, which makes sense in the face of invading bacteria. Scarring could be the price to pay for protecting against infection. Embryos cannot mount such a response until late in gestation, and this could be part of the reason they don't scar. Martin and his colleagues recently studied mice genetically incapable of raising an immune response because they lack key immune cells called macrophages and neutrophils 6 . When these mice are wounded as newborns, they not only seem not to scar, they also heal faster. Gillian Ashcroft, a consultant in tissue repair at the University of Manchester, UK, further bolstered the case when she showed that mice lacking a protein called Smad3, which is involved in inflammation, healed their skin wounds faster than normal mice 7 . Immunologist Luisa DiPietro and her colleagues at Loyola University Medical Center in Maywood, Illinois, have made similar findings in mice lacking neutrophils 8 . DiPietro's team has also looked at the mucous membranes in the mouth. Although this environment is a hotbed of bacteria, wounds in the mouth of mice show less inflammation and heal faster than those in the skin 9 . \u201cThe emerging evidence all leads to this idea that in healing wounds, less inflammation might be better,\u201d says DiPietro. To hear Ferguson tell it, the drive to better healing is already under way. In 2000, he co-founded Renovo, a Manchester-based biotechnology company. The firm is well into clinical trials of several drugs aimed at reducing post-operative scarring. \n               Mimicking embryos \n             Renovo's drugs stem from Ferguson's work on different forms of a chemical signal, a protein called transforming growth factor \u03b2 (TGF\u03b2). This plays a key role in scar formation, summoning and activating inflammatory cells, as well as spurring fibroblasts to make matrix. In work on mice and sheep embryos, Ferguson found that embryonic wounds have very high levels of one form of the protein, called TGF\u03b2-3, but very low levels of TGF\u03b2-1 and TGF\u03b2-2. In adult wounds, the profiles of these forms are reversed 10 , 11 . Ferguson's team discovered that by mimicking the embryonic profiles in adult animal wounds through adding more TGF\u03b2-3 or suppressing TGF\u03b2-1 and TGF\u03b2-2, they could reduce scarring 12 . Today, Renovo's flagship product \u2014 a human genetically engineered TGF\u03b2-3 dubbed Juvista, has passed initial safety and efficacy trials in skin wounds. Ferguson is now preparing to publish the trial data, and if all goes well, he predicts that Juvista could be on the market in 2009. Martin, too, is optimistic. He foresees a day when designer drugs modulating the inflammatory response will improve myriad diseases in which inflammation goes awry, from Crohn's to heart disease. Getting there, he notes, will take a far better understanding of what he calls \u201cthis can of worms we know nothing about\u201d. He adds: \u201cBecause this is such a complex process, we've got to go back to the embryo, back to a genetically tractable organism like the fly, to start to understand it and to watch it.\u201d \n                     Making wounds heal faster \n                   \n                     Genetics of a healer mouse \n                   \n                     Stem cell web focus \n                   \n                     Renovo \n                   \n                     Paul Martin \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Emma Marris meets the unconventional biologist who has devoted her life to studying the exotic ecosystems of the deep. Some 2,300 metres under the sea, Richard Lutz was beginning to wonder whether he should worry. The deep-sea submersible  Alvin  in which he was riding had come to a shuddering halt. Next to him, the pilot stared intently out of the windows. \u201cWe can't move,\u201d said Cindy Lee Van Dover, at the controls of a truck-sized craft stuck at the bottom of the ocean. \u201cWe are just going to sit here and think.\u201d As Lutz, a marine biologist at Rutgers University, tells it, Van Dover's calm approach got them out of a potentially deadly situation that day in 1991. He was readying his handheld tape recorder to capture his last words, but after checking and rechecking  Alvin 's controls, Van Dover concluded that the sub's front shield had probably scooped up hundreds of kilograms of mud. Hours later, she had managed to ditch enough weight to allow the sub to ascend safely to the surface. Such deliberate cool in the face of danger is practically a requirement for deep-sea pilots. But it has served Van Dover equally well in her unconventional academic career studying deep-sea ecosystems. In a small field crowded with powerful personalities, she has sometimes irritated the establishment by not following a traditional path. Yet her trademark intensity \u2014 a quality she readily describes as \u201cstubbornness\u201d \u2014 has often helped her to ride out the storms. Van Dover has racked up hundreds of hours in submersibles on the sea floor, including a period in the early 1990s when she spent more time on the ocean bottom than any other scientist. That experience, combined with her natural curiosity for all things oceanic, set the stage for her to make leaps of reasoning that might seem counterintuitive to her colleagues, but which sometimes result in startling new insights into vent creatures. These creatures thrive in a peculiar environment that, at first glance, seems hostile to life. They live along cracks in the sea floor where water, superheated by volcanic activity, gushes out of towering chimneys. These hydrothermal vents are home to communities of fantastic organisms ranging from mats of bacteria living off sulphides to long, pale, red-tipped tubeworms that sway in the current. \n               All at sea \n             An invertebrate zoologist at heart, Van Dover finds this diversity inspiring. She is excited by, as she puts it, \u201call the weird ways you can be alive\u201d. Her explorations have taken her from the relatively well characterized vents on the mid-Atlantic ridge, to the rarely visited depths of the Indian Ocean and the seas around Fiji and Easter Island. Yet despite all the time she has spent on \u2014 and in \u2014 the water, Van Dover still gets seasick on the first few days of a voyage. Not that she lets that put her off. \u201cI love the romance of going to sea,\u201d she says with a smile.\u201cI love the phrase, \u2018I'm going to sea\u2019.\u201d This life-long passion arose when she was an undergraduate studying zoology at Rutgers. Fascinated by the bizarre biology of deep-sea creatures, she applied to the joint graduate programme in oceanography run by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI). When she didn't get in, she spent six years working as an itinerant lab technician and sharpening her mathematical skills until she was accepted on to the programme. At the WHOI, Van Dover was soon making waves with a seemingly outlandish hypothesis: she believed that there may be a light source in the inky depths by the vents. Van Dover had been puzzling over a species of eyeless rift shrimp called  Rimicaris exoculata , which had been recovered from the Atlantic. Watching videos of the shrimps at the vents, she saw two reflective patches running down their backs. But when she examined the specimens brought to the surface, she found that the preservation process had rendered the blotches invisible. The patches, which had never been noticed before, looked like some kind of sensor. Van Dover guessed that they might be highly modified eyes for sensing light. But why would a shrimp in the lightless depths need eyes? To find out if there was any light to respond to, Van Dover asked researchers going on a vent-mapping expedition to use a sensitive camera, designed for astronomical imaging, to take pictures of the seemingly pitch-black chimneys. Sure enough, the passengers aboard  Alvin  sent a brief message to the surface: \u201cVents glow.\u201d Van Dover suggested that the shrimps use their \u2018eyes\u2019 to keep them close enough to the vents to feed on bacteria, but far enough away to prevent them from being cooked by the ferocious heat 1 . Other biologists gradually accepted the idea, convinced by her marshalling of the evidence. \u201cI learned a lot from seeing those eyes and learning how to prove that they are eyes,\u201d she says. \u201cYou can't do science by assertion.\u201d \n               Driving force \n             The shrimp discovery propelled Van Dover into the media spotlight, although some within the small community of vent biologists were less than thrilled by the amount of attention she attracted. \u201cI had a mentor who was not happy,\u201d she says. Not for the last time, she found herself at odds with some senior researchers in her field. And her next move took her colleagues even more by surprise. In 1989, with her PhD fresh in her hand, Van Dover decided that the best way to get to the sea floor regularly would be to become a pilot for  Alvin . Owned by the US Navy and run by the WHOI, the submersible has made more than 4,000 dives since it was commissioned in 1964, including a visit to the wreck of the  Titanic . To learn the sub's inner workings, she began memorizing blueprints and perfecting electrical repairs. It was not an easy job. Some of  Alvin 's other pilots did not welcome her into their exclusively male club. Many of her academic colleagues thought she was throwing away a promising career in research. But Van Dover persevered, determined to spend as much time as she could at the bottom of the sea. After being certified as  Alvin 's first and so far only female pilot, Van Dover spent three years nearly constantly at sea. She dived as often as every other day, spending her hours out of the water monitoring other dives from the boat or repairing the sub. Although the hours were long and the work tough, she says she got an unparalleled education: \u201cI was essentially a postdoc to everybody who came aboard that ship.\u201d Thanks in part to her pilot experience, Van Dover has visited the ocean floor more than 100 times, 48 as pilot-in-command. Although she never gets bored of the destination, the lengthy descents have become tiresome. \u201cI wish I could just snap my fingers and be at the bottom,\u201d she says. These days, she often gives up her seat in the sub to a student. Van Dover retired as a pilot in 1991, and now serves on a committee overseeing the building of a new sub to replace  Alvin . But she remains fond of the vehicle she once knew so intimately. \u201cShe's a sweetheart,\u201d Van Dover says. \u201cI still go kick her tyres when I'm anywhere near her.\u201d Conquering  Alvin  took an intensity of purpose that characterizes Van Dover's career. \u201cShe is just so focused,\u201d says Robert Vrijenhoek, a deep-sea biologist at the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute in Moss Landing, California, who has sailed with Van Dover many times. \u201cShe sets her mind on doing something and you collaborate with her, and by George it gets done.\u201d After her stint as  Alvin  pilot, Van Dover wrote a popular-science book about the deep sea called  The Octopus's Garden . She found that writing had a therapeutic effect, allowing her to work through the stresses of pilot training and of trying to scramble back onto the academic track. \u201cIt was catharsis,\u201d she says. \n               Making a splash \n             Many of her peers see her first as an ambassador of vent science. \u201cA very eloquent writer who has done some great communicating to the general public,\u201d is how Charles Fisher, a vent biologist at Pennsylvania State University, describes her. \u201cHer research is easy to explain and sexy, and there is nothing wrong with that.\u201d Van Dover returned to academia in 1992, first at the WHOI, and later at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina, and the University of Alaska in Fairbanks. Now she is based at the College of William and Mary in Williamsburg, Virginia. When she isn't teaching, she is back at sea taking long cruises to the vents. She admits that she works on whatever interests her most, and she rounds up whomever she needs to get the job done. \u201cI've really been an opportunist,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen I see a good story, I go for it.\u201d Her most recent finding was published just this summer, and in some ways it picks up where she left off as a graduate student. While hunting for microscopic life around vents at the East Pacific Rise, Van Dover and her team found photosynthetic bacteria living in the black depths 2 . If further research shows that the creatures live by the vents all the time, and don't just visit from brighter areas, then these bacteria would be the first organisms ever found to photosynthesize without sunlight. Astrobiologists are thrilled about this finding, envisioning distant dark planets teeming with photosynthetic life. As for the source of the light at the vents, that remains a mystery. It can't be explained by thermal radiation from the vents alone, as too much of the light is in the visible part of the spectrum. Possible sources include sonoluminescence, in which imploding bubbles emit a brief flash of light, or sulphide oxidation by bacteria. For now, Van Dover says she will leave that question for other specialists. She has moved on to study shellfish diseases \u2014 in particular a virulent condition that turns the flesh of giant vent mussels black. The myriad life-forms by the vents are likely to provide her career with plenty more twists and turns, but whichever path she takes it will lead only one way in the end: straight to the bottom. \n                     Venerable deep-sea sub to be replaced \n                   \n                     Deep-sea mission finds life in the Lost City \n                   \n                     Marine conservation: Sink or swim \n                   \n                     Bone-devouring worms discovered \n                   \n                     Origins of life: Born in a watery commune \n                   \n                     WHOI page on Alvin \n                   \n                     The College of William & Mary \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

To mark the publication of the chimpanzee genome,  Nature  asked four individuals for their different perspectives. \n               James Mollison: Picture this \n             The chimp genome reinforces just how close we are to our primate relatives. \u201cBut I have never doubted the similarities between human and chimp,\u201d says James Mollison. Staring into the eyes of a chimpanzee's face, its photo blown up to an impressive two metres tall, you can see where he's coming from. Mollison's photographic exhibition of ape portraits, called  Face to Face , is currently showing at the Natural History Museum in London. His pictures of 30 chimpanzees, bonobos, gorillas and orang-utans are all taken in passport style \u2014 to reinforce a feeling of kinship when people view them. \u201cThat's the one photo that everybody has,\u201d Mollison says. This required the photographer to get close to his subjects, which put wild animals out of the picture. So Mollison started phoning and e-mailing wildlife sanctuaries. Those in his native Britain were not very supportive. \u201cThey said you can't expect a chimp to sit for a portrait,\u201d he says. But over the course of three years, Mollison completed his project by visiting zoos and ape sanctuaries in Africa, Asia, Europe and the United States. You can get a chimp to pose, Mollison found \u2014 although it's difficult. First he had to gain their trust, spending days hanging out with them and making friends. \u201cGetting them to stare into the camera wasn't easy,\u201d he says. One trick was to pick an imaginary flea from their chin, then put it on top of the lens. Bribery with peanuts also worked well. From the crow's feet creases in the apes' faces to their grey hairs and double chins, the resulting images appear uncannily human, each face as individual and expressive as our own. Staring into their chocolate-brown eyes, the full gamut of human emotion seems to stare back. The wrinkled faces portray, by turns, humour, anger and wisdom. Mollison is known for his photojournalism. He has depicted the ravages of tuberculosis for the World Health Organization, and when working for Benetton's  Colors  magazine his subjects included La Modela prison in Bogot\u00e1, Colombia, and East African refugees. But he admits to having known little about the suffering wrought by the bushmeat trade until he embarked on the  Face to Face  project. Most of Mollison's subjects were orphaned when their parents were slaughtered for meat. And years later, many still suffer from emotional trauma. Chim, for instance, was photographed in 2001 at the Mvog Betsi Zoo in Cameroon. As an infant, her parents were killed by poachers. Later \u2018rescued\u2019 by a local environmental journalist who dressed her as a child, Chim was taught to dance to receive food \u2014 something she still does, when hungry. Despite their troubled pasts, most of the animals have retained a sense of mischief, says Mollison. Some apes dive-bombed him from trees; others untied his shoelaces. \u201cThey tried to break anything they could. The level of excitement reminded me of being in a pillow fight when I was a kid. But they were also incredibly warm, and needed affection.\u201d Mollison hopes his work will further the cause of ape conservation, and sees it as a celebration of evolution. The faces and expressions portrayed in his pictures are so similar to ours that they blur the boundary between human and ape. With about a quarter of US college graduates denying that humans and chimps have a common ancestry, this is an important message to convey, Mollison says. \n               Helen Pilcher \n             \u2192  http://www.nhm.ac.uk/face-to-face \n               Peter Singer: Rights and wrongs \n             \u201cWe demand the extension of the community of equals to include all great apes: human beings, chimpanzees, bonobos, gorillas and orangutans.\u201d So reads the  Declaration on Great Apes , a statement issued by the Great Ape Project. Co-founded in 1993 by the Australian-born ethicist and philosopher Peter Singer, the project's ultimate goal is for chimps and other great apes to be granted three \u2018human\u2019 rights: the right to life, to liberty and to protection from torture. \u201cThe fact that they clearly have some self-awareness shows that we should treat them differently,\u201d says Singer. \u201cThe case for granting them some basic rights is a stronger one than might be made for mice and other animals.\u201d Singer believes the Seattle-based project has influenced reforms enacted over the past decade. Chimpanzees are used far less often in invasive biomedical research than they used to be, and when they are too old or sick to be used in research, scientists now retire them to sanctuaries, instead of killing them. \u201cI think we've had some impact in spreading this consensus,\u201d he says. Singer is a controversial figure, whose views on animal rights, abortion and euthanasia have won both plaudits and violent criticism. An advocate of veganism and opponent of most vivisection, his 1975 book  Animal Liberation  is widely credited with launching the animal-rights movement. Now based at Princeton University in New Jersey, he has outraged some religious groups with his support for abortion, and his justification of euthanasia in cases where a patient, such as someone overtaken by Alzheimer's disease, has become a \u201cnonperson\u201d. At the heart of Singer's ideas lies a utilitarian approach to ethics, and a rejection of \u2018speciesism\u2019. The striking genetic similarity between people and chimps is not a crucial factor in shaping this outlook, he says: \u201cI don't think that knowing which genes chimps share with us actually determines anything about their moral status in any meaningful way.\u201d Singer believes that apes' rights come from their moral and cognitive capacities. But he hopes that the publicity surrounding the publication of the chimp genome will advance the Great Ape Project's cause, and drive a greater respect for all animals \u2014 not just chimps. \u201cIt will help bridge the gulf that we mentally place between ourselves and animals,\u201d he says. \u201cWe will see chimpanzees as kin, and the differences between us and other animals as graduated, rather than a sharp discontinuity.\u201d \n               Erika Check \n             \u2192  http://www.greatapeproject.org \n               Gary Marcus: Talking point \n             Give a chimpanzee a keyboard, a computer and years of tuition, and the betting is it won't write the complete works of Shakespeare. In fact, you'd be lucky if it stumbled on a sentence. Chimpanzees may be many things, but linguists they are not, says Gary Marcus, a cognitive scientist at New York University. Scientists and the public alike have been impressed by the talents of animals such as the chimp Washoe and the bonobo Kanzi, who have learned to communicate using sign language and keyboards. But Marcus remains sceptical of the value of such experiments. \u201cIt's a silly game to see how much a chimp can act like a human,\u201d he says. No one can doubt chimpanzees' ability to communicate. In the wild, the animals grunt, screech and holler \u2014 vocalizations that are part of the fabric of chimp society. And in the lab, chimps can learn and use symbols in a way similar to that in which young children use words. But is this really language? Marcus thinks not. Chimps learn words one at a time and never show the explosive acquisition of language accomplished by excited toddlers. And although children learn to talk about past, present and future, chimps seem to communicate solely about the here and now. Chimps also lack what some experts have called the linguistic \u2018silver bullet\u2019: the ability to combine bits of language into larger units. Recursion, as it is known, expands the range of possible topics and lets the speaker appreciate the views of others. Even the most sophisticated chimp, Marcus points out, would be baffled by a sentence such as: \u201cShe knows that I know where the peanut is hidden.\u201d Humans may be the only animals to crack the recursion nut, but the skill is just one of many likely to be crucial for language, says Marcus. And the chimp genome may help us to pinpoint others. \u201cEvolution tends to proceed not by starting over but by tinkering with what is already in place,\u201d says Marcus. Although chimps don't have language, they're likely to share some of the features that predispose one to it. Knowledge of the genetic sequence may help us decipher the genes behind this shared cognitive backbone. \u201cIn the meantime,\u201d says Marcus, \u201cit will help if people stop worrying specifically about whether chimps happen to have language and instead ask: what are the many things we have in common, and how did those pave the road to language?\u201d Still, Marcus understands why some people want to ascribe human-like abilities to chimpanzees. \u201cI think it's pretty hard not to anthropomorphize chimps,\u201d he says. \u201cOur brains are set up to analyse other entities in terms of their goals, beliefs, desires and so forth, and chimps look for all the world like they've got those things.\u201d He does not, however, think that those working with chimps should become completely detached and dispassionate: \u201cGood scientists are objective, but objectivity does not demand that scientists be blind to potential points of contact between humans and other species.\u201d \n               Helen Pilcher \n             \n               Peter Walsh: Going ape \n             Like many of today's conservation biologists, Peter Walsh was drawn to his chosen career by television documentaries showing Jane Goodall and the chimpanzees of Gombe in Tanzania. Today, those cosy childhood memories are overshadowed by a sense of desperation and outrage at the plight of Africa's remaining chimps. Frustrated by politics and plans that don't deliver, Walsh is also battling against sceptics who doubt his evidence of a looming catastrophe. \u201cThe world's great apes are in serious danger. If we don't act fast, it's going to be too late,\u201d he says. Walsh, who works at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany, has reason to be alarmed. His modelling studies suggest that ape populations in western equatorial Africa \u2014 the world's last stronghold for chimpanzees and gorillas \u2014 have been slashed by more than half in the past 20 years (P. D. Walsh  et al .  Nature   422 , 611\u2013614; 2003). Walsh blames illegal hunting and a serious epidemic of the deadly Ebola virus. Although biologists acknowledge the bloody impact of the bushmeat trade, he is frustrated that few seem worried by the insidious threat from Ebola. \u201cI'm totally amazed by the response,\u201d he says. Some experts even deny that ape populations are in crisis at all. They presume that because western equatorial Africa's forests are still intact, the resident ape populations are safe. Walsh says they don't bargain on the ravages of natural disease and the dogged determination of poachers. Many conservationists think that ape populations will simply bounce back from the virus's attack, as resistant animals interbreed and repopulate the forests. But with female chimps taking 14 years to reach sexual maturity and producing just one baby every six years, that's not going to happen, warns Walsh. Left to their own devices, some populations would take 150 years to recover, he says. Vaccines are an option. Two candidates that protect lab monkeys \u2014 and may protect apes \u2014 already exist, but these are being developed for human use. Last year, the US government set aside US$6 billion to speed the development of drugs and vaccines against bioterror agents such as Ebola. But funding for ape studies is harder to come by. Just US$10 million would fund small-scale lab tests and pilot studies on wild apes, says Walsh, adding that the vaccine could make it to the field within a few years. \u201cIn terms of conservation, it's a bargain,\u201d he says. But it would require a concerted lobbying campaign that \u2014 to Walsh's immense frustration \u2014 shows no sign of emerging. In the meantime, simple measures could make a difference. Ebola is thought to be spread by an animal \u2014 as yet unidentified \u2014 which doesn't succumb to the severe disease. Perhaps this creature doesn't like wet feet, as outbreaks appear to be confined by water. Clearing small rivers of overhanging trees might halt the disease's spread, says Walsh. \u201cAll you need is a dugout canoe and a chainsaw.\u201d Law enforcement also needs to be stepped up to protect apes from hunters, says Walsh. Realistically, just a handful of west Africa's score of national parks have effective anti-poaching strategies. Elsewhere, organized gangs of hunters supply a well-structured food chain transporting bushmeat to major cities. \u201cThe poachers get cigarettes and a few hundred francs,\u201d says Walsh. \u201cIt's their bosses who are making the profit.\u201d Some of the ringleaders do get arrested, but corruption is rife, so they often walk free. Unless things change, ape populations will continue to dwindle. Currently, there are about 15 sites that host 5,000 or more great apes. Over the next ten years, Walsh predicts these could shrink to just a couple of strongholds, each with a couple of hundred apes or fewer. The chimp genome may yield many things, including therapies to treat ailing apes, \u201cbut it will have zero practical impact on chimp conservation\u201d, warns Walsh. \u201cThe repercussions of the chimp genome will arrive in Africa in 10 to 15 years time. By then it will be too late.\u201d \n               Helen Pilcher \n             \n                     Ape populations decimated by hunting and Ebola virus \n                   \n                     N@n special \n                   \n                     Nature web focus \n                   \n                     www.nhm.ac.uk/face-to-face \n                   \n                     www.greatapeproject.org \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},
{"file_id": "437185a", "url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/437185a", "year": 2005, "authors": [{"name": "Erika Check"}], "parsed_as_year": "2006_or_before", "body": "Tackling the legal and ethical minefield associated with human embryonic stem-cell research is not for the faint-hearted. Erika Check meets one man who is relishing the challenge. Kevin Eggan has always been a climber. He grew up in the flat cornfields of Normal, Illinois, but every summer his father would take him mountaineering among the tall peaks of the Cascade Range in the Pacific Northwest. \u201cSummer was nirvana in the mountains,\u201d Eggan says. \u201cIn the winter I would go back to school in Illinois, and I would just wait for the next summer to come along so I could go climbing again.\u201d Eggan is now assistant professor of molecular and cellular biology at Harvard University. His passion for climbing may explain some of his success as a scientist, which his colleagues say is marked by two things: enthusiasm and a dogged determination to tackle the toughest problems in his field. Eggan's next project could be his most challenging yet. This autumn he hopes to use cloning techniques on human cells to study conditions such as diabetes and Parkinson's disease \u2014 work that isn't being done at any other US university. But even as he prepares to begin these experiments, opponents are striving to ban them \u2014 and they are using some of Eggan's own findings to support their case. \n               Bespoke cells \n             Working with developmental biologist Doug Melton at the Harvard Stem Cell Institute, Eggan wants to generate embryonic stem cells that match individual patients. To do this he will use a technique called somatic cell nuclear transfer \u2014 more commonly referred to as cloning. Eggan will take a sample of skin cells from a patient, and will extract the nuclei from individual cells. Each nucleus will be transferred into a human egg stripped of its own genetic material. In theory, the egg will then divide and develop into an embryo containing only the patient's DNA. And in the process, the egg will reprogramme the nucleus back to its earliest state, which means that cells from the embryo should have the potential to generate all of the tissues in the human body. Each of these embryonic stem cells will carry the distinctive genetic quirks of the patient who donated the skin cells. By studying these stem cells, Eggan hopes to understand why the donor patients became ill, and what might be done to cure them. Eggan's introduction to this technique came seven years ago, when he joined Rudolf Jaenisch's lab as a graduate student at the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Jaenisch was starting up a mouse cloning project to study the genetic changes that make it possible for adult cells to be reprogrammed. Eggan attacked this cloning project with zeal. \u201cI thought it was the most exciting and coolest thing that I had ever seen,\u201d he says. But grim reality soon set in. Eggan shut himself in the mouse warehouse every day, seven days a week, for about a year. But he kept failing. He could make embryos, but they simply refused to develop any further than a single cell. What saved Eggan was his persistence \u2014 and his love of video games. He began to approach cloning the same way he had dealt with the classic arcade game  Super Mario Bros . \u2014 by refusing to be beaten by a tricky stage or enemy. \u201cThere are people who really relish getting past that challenge, and they replay the game over and over and over and over again until they figure out exactly how to do it. That's the kind of person you need to be to succeed at nuclear transplantation,\u201d Eggan says. \u201cAnd fortunately, that appealed to me.\u201d His determination eventually paid off and enabled Jaenisch's lab to publish a series of key papers on cloning and its effects on cloned animals 1 , 2 , 3 . Melton, who was using human embryos left over from  in vitro  fertilization treatment to study disease, heard about Eggan's persistence from Jaenisch. He and Eggan met up and hit it off. \u201cKevin has this attitude that science can be fun,\u201d Melton says. \u201cAnd he doesn't hesitate to do an experiment because it's too hard.\u201d The pair decided to start a project that would use cloning to produce new human embryonic stem-cell lines. The lines would be tailored to individual patients with diabetes and disorders of the brain and nervous system. \n               Private function \n             In 2002, the pair began the difficult task of securing funding and ethical approval for their project. Two separate measures bar the project from receiving funding from the US government. One, the Dickey Amendment, is passed by Congress every year and prevents scientists from using taxpayers' money to create or destroy human embryos for research, such as cloning. The second measure is a four-year-old executive order passed by President George W. Bush. It bans federal support for work on embryonic stem-cell lines created since 9 August 2001. Melton is funded by the private Howard Hughes Medical Institute in Chevy Chase, Maryland, and last year, Harvard created the Harvard Stem Cell Institute, which will use money from other private donors to fund stem-cell research. With the money in the bank, Eggan and Melton are ready to begin their project. They are just waiting for a final approval from a Harvard ethics review board, which they hope to get this autumn. In the three years it has taken to lay the groundwork for the cloning experiments, Eggan has tackled another challenge facing the stem-cell field: the shortage of human eggs. But in doing so he may have unwittingly played into the hands of those who want to ban work on human embryonic cells. Cloning to produce stem cells requires human eggs. But few women want to endure the uncomfortable cycle of hormones and surgery that accompanies egg donation. In June, Eggan told a scientific meeting that he had developed a technique that may eventually solve this problem 4 . Eggan has created cells with properties similar to embryonic stem cells by fusing embryonic stem cells from existing lines together with skin cells. The embryonic stem cells seem to reprogramme the skin-cell nuclei just as eggs do. Eggan calls his creations \u2018hybrids\u2019 \u2014 genetic remixes that act a lot like embryonic stem cells, but don't actually come from embryos. The paper describing the work appeared last month 5  \u2014 just as the US Senate was gearing up to debate embryonic stem-cell research. And so, perhaps inevitably, Eggan's findings have taken on a life of their own. In May, the House of Representatives passed a measure to overturn the Bush restrictions on stem-cell research funding. The House bill would allow funding for research on stem-cell lines derived from embryos left over from  in vitro  fertilization procedures. The Senate is now considering passing that same bill \u2014 perhaps as early as this month. \n               The third way \n             But opponents of the work have seized on studies such as Eggan's as a possible third way out of the debate. They say that instead of overturning the Bush ban, the Senate should simply fund research that aims to make new stem-cell lines without creating embryos. On 12 July, Leon Kass, a conservative bioethicist and chairman of the President's Council on Bioethics, lauded Eggan's work in the  Washington Post  on the morning of a crucial Senate hearing on stem cells. \u201cEvery public-spirited American should be encouraged by these findings. We should be hopeful that a technological solution to our moral dilemma might soon be found,\u201d he wrote. The publication of Eggan's paper only added fuel to the fire. On 23 August, the same newspaper quoted Senator Tom Coburn (Republican, Oklahoma), a physician who has led the opposition to embryonic stem-cell research: \u201cAll this is confirmation we will see breakthroughs without compromising ethical standards,\u201d he said. \u201cWe're not going to have to go that way if we can just be patient and fund the basic science.\u201d Eggan says that these debates are misleading, because his work does not create substitutes for stem cells derived from embryos. The hybrids still contain two nuclei: one from a skin cell and one from an embryonic stem cell. So they have an abnormally high amount of DNA, and Eggan needs to work out how to remove the embryonic stem cell's DNA. Eggan adds that he has only just begun working with the hybrids, so it is not clear what they will or won't be able to do. \u201cIt's frustrating,\u201d Eggan says, \u201cbecause they're implying that our work is a solution, which it is not yet. These are ideas in their most nascent stages.\u201d However the hybrid research develops, Eggan will continue with his planned cloning experiments using private funds. But the political debates over stem-cell research could still threaten this work. Some in the Senate are pushing for legal bans on any kind of cloning, which would outlaw Eggan's experiments. These laws seem unlikely to pass at the moment, but their supporters raise the issue year after year. All the controversy could make a young biologist wary. After all, it's difficult enough to get a scientific career off the ground, even without the threat that the government might ban your research. But Eggan is used to the controversy; he began graduate school in 1998, the year after scientists in Scotland announced the birth of Dolly the sheep, the first cloned mammal. \u201cNo one really expected the social and political maelstrom over stem cells and cloning to crescendo to this point,\u201d says Eggan. \u201cBut as I've been around since the beginning of all of this, I've been able to cope with the gradual incline.\u201d No stranger to inclines of any kind, Eggan still finds time to indulge his passion for climbing. Last November, he celebrated his father's 70th birthday by joining him on a little hike \u2014 a 6,000-metre jaunt up Mount Kilimanjaro. \n                     Rebooted cells tackle ethical concerns \n                   \n                     Senator boosts chances of stem-cell reform \n                   \n                     Altered embryos offered as solution to stem-cell rift \n                   \n                     Korea's accelerating stem-cell work prompts calls for global ethical rules \n                   \n                     Stem Cell Web Focus \n                   \n                     Kevin Eggan \n                   \n                     Doug Melton \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

But is it really alive? Rex Dalton joins the team trying to save this elusive bird. The Big Woods in Arkansas is not a good place to be on a hot summer day. The swampy forest is thick with mud, poison ivy and snakes. Yet early last month, a dozen scientists slogged their way through these bottomlands towards a mesh tent abuzz with insects \u2014 the heart of an unusual US environmental project. The group's goal is to save the ivory-billed woodpecker ( Campephilus principalis ), a magnificent bird thought to have died off at least 50 years ago as its forest habitat was chopped down. In April, a team led by ornithologists at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, stunned the birding world by saying they had evidence that the woodpecker still lived in the Big Woods (J. W. Fitzpatrick  et al .  Science   308 , 1460\u20131462; 2005). Now more scientists are braving the wilderness as part of a federally sanctioned \u2018recovery team\u2019, charged with plotting a course to produce a healthy population of the birds. Near the Cache River National Wildlife Refuge, where the ivory-billed was reportedly rediscovered in February 2004, the team has cut the trunks of trees to create deadwood. The deadwood, in turn, should become home to insect larvae, which are the woodpecker's favourite food. If the elusive ivory-billed shows up to snack, the scientists can use the insects in the tent to identify the larvae and better understand the bird's eating habits. To some, the team's mission is a conservationist's dream, a chance to bring back an iconic bird from the brink of extinction. To others, it is a near-futile attempt \u2014 possibly at the expense of other worthwhile projects \u2014 to save a species that may no longer grace these woods. The problem is that no one can prove whether the woodpecker still exists. \n               Forest hunch \n             \u201cThe bird is here,\u201d Martjan Lammertink insists in the steamy Arkansas bottomlands. Lammertink, a graduate student at the University of Amsterdam, has studied rare woodpeckers from Mexico to Cuba to Borneo. He moved to the nearby town of Brinkley so that he could devote himself to pursuing the \u2018Lord God bird\u2019 \u2014 named after what people would exclaim when they saw its gleaming bill, ferocious red crest, and body nearly half a metre long. Yet not all ornithologists are as convinced as Lammertink. Several, including Jerome Jackson of Florida Gulf Coast University in Fort Myers, have repeatedly questioned the Cornell team's evidence for the bird's existence. Neither the four-second video purporting to show an ivory-billed, nor the sound recordings released last month at a bird meeting in California, satisfy this group of sceptics. Ivory-billed searchers, Jackson says, \u201care shooting in the dark\u201d. The quest for the ivory-billed is steeped in politics as well as science. The Bush administration, smarting from criticism over its environmental policies, hailed the purported rediscovery as a rare piece of good news. Cornell team leader, John Fitzpatrick, had hoped that his occasional birding companion, First Lady Laura Bush, would make the announcement. But news leaks soon turned into a flood, and the secretaries of the interior and agriculture held the press conference instead \u2014 on 28 April, the day after the manuscript on the find had been accepted by  Science . Now, the federal government is providing an extra $10 million to save the woodpecker's habitat, money redirected from other conservation projects even as congressional Republicans consider cutting back on the protections of the Endangered Species Act. Researchers on the ivory-billed's recovery team face a formidable challenge - figuring out how to save a bird that may already be extinct. Even if it still lives, there may be only a handful of individuals left, not enough to save the species as a whole. US scientists have brought other birds back from the verge of extinction, including the whooping crane ( Grus americana ) and the California condor ( Gymnogyps californianus ). But never before has the species in question been almost completely invisible. The search for the ivory-billed, one scientist says, is like looking for \u201ca moving needle in one hell of a haystack\u201d. \n               Search party \n             Still, the hunt goes on, and last month the recovery team met for the first time in Little Rock to explore possible research fronts. Some ornithologists are developing a \u2018life-table model\u2019 to try to determine how many of the birds could have survived, factoring in estimated lifespan and habitat. The best guess is about 15 pairs. Other scientists are examining the chisel-like mark of the ivory-billed's beak to see if it can be discerned from that of other woodpeckers. And major efforts are under way to increase the habitat for the bird's larvae hunt \u2014 the woodpecker can roam 20 kilometres a day in search of dying trees from which to strip bark. Such studies are rarely controversial, but the $10-million habitat-preservation plan has raised some eyebrows. At the same time that biologists at the Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) saw their budgets slashed, the ivory-billed project got a cash infusion. Meanwhile, successful programmes to recover other endangered species were scaled back. One such example is the Kirtland's warbler ( Dendroica kirtlandii ), a small bird that breeds in Michigan and winters in the Bahamas. More than 30 years ago, the warbler population included some 160 singing males. Today, after years of trapping brown-headed cowbirds ( Molothrus ater ) that parasitically use the warblers' nests, the population boasts a record number of more than 1,400 singing males. But this spring, cowbird trapping in Michigan was drastically cut back; only about 1,100 cowbirds were snared compared with about 4,000 the previous year. Federal biologists cannot prove that the warbler programme is suffering because of the ivory-billed woodpecker, but many find the timing curious. \u201cIt doesn't make any sense to put one species at risk to save another,\u201d says Eric Carey, parks director at the Bahamas National Trust in Nassau, who studies the warbler's winter habitat. FWS biologist Jon Andrew, who manages federal refuges in the southeastern United States, argues that such diversions are justified given the ivory-billed's precarious situation. \u201cThere was enough evidence that we ought to be acting as if the bird was there,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen you make decisions on spending money, there are winners and losers.\u201d To the public at least, the ivory-billed woodpecker is clearly a winner. The rediscovery announcement triggered a rush of national goodwill. Headlines trumpeted the bird that seemed to have made it against all odds. Arkansas experienced a miniature tourist boom as birders flocked to the refuge. \n               Elvis lives \n             In the face of this excitement it seems hard to believe that the FWS had been in the process of declaring the ivory-billed woodpecker extinct. No one had definitively seen one in the United States since 1944, although a separate population may have held on in Cuba until at least the 1980s. When the Cornell ornithologists finally thought they had spotted an ivory-billed, they were so amazed that they called the bird \u2018Elvis\u2019, after Elvis Presley, who was born nearby in the Mississippi River delta, and whose fans claimed to see him long after he died in 1977. Yet, much as for the real Elvis, evidence for Elvis the woodpecker was greeted with scepticism. For years, rumours of ivory-billed sightings had swirled through the community but were never substantiated. In March 2003, a group of diehard ivory-billed seekers thought they heard and saw the bird in the White River National Wildlife Refuge, about 75 kilometres south of where Elvis would later be spotted. Arizona naturalist Mary Scott posted a report of the sighting on her website, which birders monitor regularly. Among those drawn back to Arkansas was Tim Gallagher, a journalist who edits  Living Bird  magazine at Cornell. His subsequent trip and reported sighting in February 2004 launched the university's project with local birdwatchers. \n               Hard knocks \n             Over the next winter, when the trees were bare of their thick foliage, the team watched both refuges for months, using paid observers and their friends. They installed models of ivory-bills on trees, hoping to attract the real thing. They set out sound recorders to capture the woodpeckers calling or knocking on trees. The effort echoed a similar quest 80 years earlier. By 1924, ivory-billed woodpeckers were supposed to be extinct, victim to rapid logging and to the fashion for collecting dead rare birds. But Cornell professor Arthur Augustus Allen, one of the world's leading ornithologists, photographed a pair of the birds that year in Florida. His rediscovery, which made headlines across the United States, triggered an intense effort to document the birds before they vanished for good. Unlike Allen's group, the modern ivory-billed searchers had the benefit of videotapes and up-to-date recording techniques. After more than a year, the team had seven woodpecker sightings it considered believable, 18,000 hours of sound recordings, and one grainy video of Elvis. When  Science  put the video on its website, it immediately provoked a sceptical reaction from some leading ornithologists. Three of them \u2014 including Jackson, who, despite his doubts, is a member of the recovery team \u2014 helped prepare a manuscript arguing that the bird in the film was probably a pileated woodpecker ( Dryocopus pileatus ), which shares similar red, black and white markings with the ivory-billed. The other co-authors on the paper were Richard Prum of Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut, and Mark Robbins of the University of Kansas at Lawrence (see  Nature   436 , 447; 2005). On 1 August, as the journal  PLoS Biology  was close to publishing their critique of the  Science  article, Prum and Robbins withdrew the manuscript while Jackson was travelling. The Cornell team had offered them new sound recordings in support of the ivory-billed, including the bird's \u2018kent, kent\u2019 call and double-rap knock. The pair had heard other  Campephilus  woodpeckers in the jungles of South America make the same distinctive double-rap as on the new tape. And Cornell's \u2018kent, kent\u2019 call matched recordings of the bird made in 1935. The evidence came from the modern remote recordings, only one-fifth of which have been fully examined. At a meeting of the American Ornithologists' Union in California in late August, Cornell scientists marshalled their evidence in several talks. Fitzpatrick's keynote lecture was greeted with thunderous applause. Even so, the three sceptics say that they withdrew their  PLoS  manuscript too hastily. They are getting support from other ornithologists, including Gary Graves, the Smithsonian Institution's curator of birds, who argues that the bird shown in the crucial video may be a pileated, not an ivory-billed, woodpecker. And some authorities say that there is unpublished evidence that helps prove that the bird in the video is a pileated woodpecker. They are referring to a 1953 film of a flying imperial woodpecker ( Campephilus imperialis ), a species extinct in its home range of western Mexico. Some years ago, Lammertink secured a copy of the film, which had been taken by a birding enthusiast. It was among the evidence shown to ornithologist Michael Patten, research director at the University of Oklahoma's Sutton Avian Research Center in Bartlesville, when he visited Cornell in June. Ornithologists generally agree that the imperial woodpecker is a sister bird to the ivory-billed, with many similar characteristics from coloration to the distinctive double-rap. But Patten was struck by the imperial's flight patterns. \u201cAs soon as I watched the film,\u201d he says, \u201cI was absolutely certain they didn't have an ivory-billed woodpecker. The bird in the film flies utterly differently to the one in the Cornell video.\u201d \n               Sound basis? \n             Fitzpatrick is not troubled by the film of the imperial woodpecker, arguing that it sheds little light on whether his video shows an ivory-billed. \u201cThey are like apples and oranges,\u201d he says of the two videos, because of different camera angles and stages of the birds' flights. To the sceptics, the strongest evidence to support the theory that Elvis lives are the sound recordings. And although Prum and Robbins are impressed by them, Jackson, Graves and Patten are more cautious. The evidence is tantalizing, they say, but not conclusive. \u201cThe sound recordings don't validate the flimsy sightings records,\u201d says Patten. Remote sound recordings are notoriously deceptive, he points out. Blue jays ( Cyanocitta cristata ) can mimic woodpecker sounds, or gunshots can be mistaken for woodpecker raps. There are also untold copies of old ivory-billed recordings in private hands, including birders who play them back in the Arkansas refuges hoping to get a response from a live bird. \u201cWe are 100% sure\u201d that the new tapes don't just capture playbacks of old sounds, says Kenneth Rosenberg of the Cornell team. Analysis of the notes and sound shows that they don't match, he says. But the team acknowledges that it can't yet rule out a wily jay mimic. For Fitzpatrick, all the evidence creates a critical mass that indicates at least one bird is out there. \u201cThere are people who need to see it to believe it,\u201d he told the ornithology meeting. \u201cI respect that.\u201d But although he hasn't been fortunate enough to see one, he is \u201cabsolutely convinced\u201d that Elvis lives. Come November, Team Elvis will be back in the Arkansas woods with more observers, more acoustic recorders and an expected $200,000 in federal funds. Already, Cornell and its partner the Nature Conservancy have raised more than $5 million in pledges to fund the search and habitat preservation. If Elvis does indeed live, he is being offered one of the best chances ever for his species to survive. \n                     Ivory-billed woodpecker raps on \n                   \n                     Ivory-billed woodpecker under scrutiny \n                   \n                     Cornell University Laboratory of Ornithology \n                   \n                     The Nature Conservancy \n                   \n                     www.ibwo.org \n                   \n                     www.birdingamerica.com/Ivorybill/ivorybilledwoodpecker.htm \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

As urbanization gathers pace across the developing world, Jessica Marshall visits Jakarta to witness its stomach-churning consequences. On the streets of this city, you can pick your poison. Clouds of black and blue-white smoke billow from the exhaust pipes of buses and motorcycles. Thirteen rivers flow northwards to Jakarta Bay, each a slurry of human waste and garbage. Scavengers pick through the city's rubbish looking for recyclable plastic and cardboard. What they can't sell, they burn \u2014 batteries, rubber shoes and all. Rising smoke from burning garbage wafts between the city's skyscrapers. Pollution in Indonesia's capital, Jakarta, is easy to see, and the causes are not hard to pinpoint. But the effects on its inhabitants' well-being are harder to quantify. Official data are scant, studies of environmental health are few, and those worst affected \u2014 the urban poor \u2014 are the least likely to be included in city records. Environmental scientists say that much could be done to improve living conditions for those most at risk from pollution. But without a stronger emphasis on research into urban public health, and the political will to act on its findings, experts are pessimistic about making rapid progress. \u201cIn the near future, there will be more environmental problems,\u201d says James Woodcock, a wastewater consultant to the World Bank who has lived in Jakarta for more than two decades. With a population of about 12 million \u2014 rising to 21 million if you include the wider conurbation of surrounding towns \u2014 Jakarta is already one of the world's largest urban areas. The population of this \u2018megacity\u2019 is predicted to grow by a third in the next decade, part of a global trend towards urbanization. By 2007, the balance of the world's population will tip to give a majority residing in towns and cities 1 . Most of the fastest-growing cities are in developing countries (see Chart, below). So Jakarta may provide a pointer to a future in which urban pollution becomes a main player in the disease burden of the developing world. \u201cThe urban physical environment is going to represent a major health threat,\u201d says David Vlahov, an epidemiologist at Columbia University in New York, and president of the International Society for Urban Health. \n               Gridlock \n             In Jakarta, air quality is already at crisis point.

Haryanto, a professor of public health at the University of Indonesia, is waiting for the worst of the traffic to subside before driving home to a Jakarta suburb, a journey of 23 kilometres that can take almost two hours. Some two million people commute into the city each day. From a ninth floor window, Haryanto and I look down on a highway on which stalled head- and tail-lights extend as far as we can see in either direction. \u201cJakarta is getting worse,\u201d says Haryanto. Traffic is responsible for more than 70% of the nitrogen oxides and particulate matter emitted into the city's air 2 . Haryanto is frustrated that the government is not doing more to monitor and reduce the thick, nostril-burning smog, or to characterize its effects on health. \u201cThe Ministry of Health doesn't care,\u201d he laments, noting that it is dissolving its subdirectorate dealing with air pollution. The limited available data paint an ugly picture. Respiratory inflammation accounts for 12.6% of deaths in Jakarta, twice the proportion in the rest of the country 3 . And estimates based on reported pollution levels attribute more than a million asthma attacks and several thousand premature deaths per year in the city to airborne soot and other particles 2 . Aside from the sheer volume of traffic, the main problems are poor fuel quality, and a failure to equip vehicles with emissions-control technologies such as catalytic converters. There have been some small steps forward: before 2001, many vehicles in Jakarta used leaded fuel. At that time, about 35% of Jakartan elementary school students had levels of lead in their blood above the World Health Organization (WHO) safety guideline of 10 micrograms per decilitre 4 . This has now dropped to less than 3%, according to Haryanto's preliminary measurements. But he is concerned that the compound that replaced lead creates emissions of benzene, a known carcinogen. \u201cI suggested to the government that they monitor benzene in the air,\u201d says Haryanto. \u201cBut they said: \u2018No funding\u201d Although Jakarta's horrendous air quality is evident from a high-rise window, experiencing the city's problems with water pollution and solid waste requires an excursion to street level. Kampung Kandang, a north Jakartan slum, faces a river and backs on to a swamp. I stand on the riverbank, watching the eerily still water slip by. A film of grease coats the surface, broken by plastic bags and other detritus. To avoid paying for garbage collection \u2014 which is intermittent, anyway \u2014 people drop their rubbish in the river. Downstream, a barrage of trash has collected on an obstacle. The sulphurous smell is overpowering. Next to me, a man flings a wokful of oil into the water. \n               Dirty old town \n             Kampung Kandang is typical of the illegal squatter settlements that line rivers and railway tracks throughout Jakarta, or sit tucked beneath the city's flyovers. It is a microcosm of the city's problems with water, sewage and solid waste. To the rear of the settlement, I watch a chicken in the swamp, scratching on an undulating surface of garbage, oblivious that it isn't on solid ground. The communal water tap opens into a bucket that hangs right above the swamp water that residents use as a latrine. Nearby, an elderly woman wades in the water, collecting swamp plants to sell for wicker. The public toilet in Kampung Kandang costs up to US$0.10 to use \u2014 no small sum for a family living on about US$2.50 a day. \u201cSo people just do it everywhere,\u201d says community leader Miftahul Falah. Water pressure from the tap is low, Falah adds, so the villagers rely on water vendors, who sell 60 litres of water for about US$0.20 \u2014 several times what wealthy Jakartans pay for water from a utility company. Even for legal residents, supplies are limited. Piped water reaches less than 60% of Jakartans, and is safe for drinking only after being boiled. About half of the supply is lost because of illegal connections and leaks. Water shortages have led many residents to tap into groundwater beneath the city. As a result, salt water is seeping into the aquifer, and subsidence has caused parts of the city to sink by a metre or so over the past decade. Garbage-clogged waterways and the fact that about 40% of Jakarta now lies below sea level conspire to cause annual floods. These hit the poor, low-lying north of the city particularly hard, bringing a litany of health problems. \u201cIf the flood lasts a long time, maybe three days,\u201d says Falah, \u201cpeople start to get sick with diarrhoea and rashes.\u201d Less than 3% of the 1.3 million cubic metres of sewage generated each day in greater Jakarta reaches a treatment plant. More than a million septic tanks are buried beneath the city, and these have contaminated most of the city's wells with faecal coliform bacteria. What's more, truck drivers hired to pump the tanks often dump their loads, untreated, into waterways. Solid-waste management is similarly chaotic. The city's Bantar Gebang landfill is a case in point \u2014 soil is applied only every few weeks and leachate is inadequately treated, says Widhi Handoko, an instructor in solid-waste management at the Ministry of Public Works. An army of 6,000 scavengers works the mountains of garbage. Like post-apocalyptic sherpas, clad in rubber boots and with wicker baskets strapped to their backs, they travel in the wake of bulldozers, plucking recyclables from the stinking heap. \n               Heaps of trouble \n             Although Bantar Gebang is nearing the end of its 20-year design lifetime, its representatives say that there is no option but to keep it open while the city seeks alternatives. A private company has developed land for a new waste-disposal site, but local residents have protested loudly. The municipal government recently announced it will build four incinerators. But this is an expensive option, and may cause other environmental and health hazards. Many people in Jakarta's poor neighbourhoods say their health is fine, despite the filth that surrounds them. But experts believe that poor sanitation is a serious health issue. Ministry of Health records show gastroenteritis is by far the most frequent disease diagnosis at local clinics and hospitals. The incidence of dengue fever has also exploded in recent years. \u201cIt is not normally an urban health issue,\u201d says Jan Speets, an adviser with the WHO in Jakarta. But flooding and the piles of rubbish throughout the city have created breeding opportunities for the mosquitoes that spread the disease. Experts in public health urge more and better research to quantify the health problems caused by poor sanitation and waste management. \u201cThere are no real studies available to reveal what's going on in the city,\u201d complains Jaap van Dissel, an infectious-disease specialist at the Leiden University Medical Center in the Netherlands. His recent investigation of the food- and water-borne diseases typhoid and paratyphoid in east Jakarta found that doctors over-diagnose the former by up to ten-fold because blood cultures that confirm the infection are not normally done 5 . This illustrates the need to improve clinical diagnoses before attempting potentially expensive campaigns to address problems with public health, says van Dissel: \u201cIt's important to know your enemies before you start shooting.\u201d Many of Jakarta's problems are shared by other megacities in the developing world. Most have large illegal shanty towns, and face similar issues with pollution and waste management. For instance, recent flooding in and around Mumbai in India, attributed in part to clogged drainage throughout the city, killed more than a thousand people, and brought water-borne diseases in its wake. \n               Scrubbing up \n             Some developing-world megacities have taken steps to clean themselves up. Mexico City's appalling smog is now beginning to clear thanks to the introduction of catalytic converters and improvements in fuel quality 6 . And the Indian capital of New Delhi is experiencing similar gains after converting its public transport to run on compressed natural gas. So what are the chances of Jakarta following suit? Experts say that solving the city's problems with environmental health will require genuine political commitment to pay for research and monitoring to characterize the problems, and spending on the infrastructure needed to solve them. Given a legacy of official corruption, and the continuing hangover from the Asian economic crisis of 1997, the obstacles are formidable \u2014 public spending on infrastructure is running at 80% less than during the heady days of the mid-1990s, when Asia's economy was booming 7 . So far, politicians seem more interested in sweeping pollution under the carpet, rather than tackling the problems it causes head-on. After the WHO labelled Jakarta the world's third most polluted metropolis in the early 1990s, air-quality monitoring equipment was moved to residential areas with lower levels of pollution. Ritola Tasmaya, secretary to the governor of Jakarta, defends the municipal government's record, pointing to developments such as a recently built busway, which will later incorporate new buses running on compressed natural gas. Tasmaya blames continuing problems with environmental health on insufficient budgets and limits to the city government's authority \u2014 rivers, he notes, remain the responsibility of the national government. \u201cJakarta as a capital city needs special support from the central government,\u201d Tasmaya concludes. \u201cThe infrastructure must be good enough so that people who come here for business, tourism and investment can be served.\u201d Foreign specialists say that significant progress could be made if existing environmental regulations were properly enforced. \u201cIt's very difficult for a government that's known to be corrupt to enforce laws,\u201d says Woodcock. But the good news is that, after years of dictatorship and corruption, Indonesia is slowly becoming more democratic. Last year, the country gained its first directly elected president, Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono. And 2007 will see the first direct election for the governor of Jakarta. For now, many of the city's residents have more immediate priorities than reducing pollution. \u201cIncome is still low,\u201d says Basah Hernowo, director of settlements and housing at the National Development Planning Agency, an arm of the central government. \u201cPeople do not care about environmental quality. They are still thinking about their stomachs.\u201d But problems such as flooding and waste mismanagement are getting so bad that people are beginning to call for change. As democracy takes root, environmental health may slowly move up the list of political priorities. \u201cIn the end,\u201d Woodcock says, \u201cI feel optimistic that there will be progress.\u201d \n                     Energy: China's burning ambition \n                   \n                     Genome project aims to take Manhattan \n                   \n                     Urban sprawl creates unwilling neighbours \n                   \n                     International Society for Urban Health \n                   \n                     WHO site on the urban environment \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},
{"file_id": "436318a", "url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/436318a", "year": 2005, "authors": [{"name": "Geoff Brumfiel"}], "parsed_as_year": "2006_or_before", "body": "For 50 years, physicists have been promising that power from nuclear fusion is imminent. Now they are poised to build an experiment that could vindicate their views. But will the machine work? Geoff Brumfiel investigates. When word came last month that a site had finally been chosen for the international fusion experiment ITER, Gerald Navratil summed up his feelings in a single word: \u201crelief\u201d. Navratil, a plasma physicist at Columbia University in New York and a member of the US ITER team, had spent the past 18 months on the sidelines, watching helplessly as France and Japan fought over which of them would host the machine. As the battle raged on, he had seen US support for the project slowly slip away. But with the location for the reactor now fixed in Cadarache, southern France, Navratil is feeling more positive. \u201cNow that we have a site, we can finally proceed in taking the next step,\u201d he says. Fusion research is difficult enough without the politics. The much-vaunted concept of mimicking the Sun and generating power from nuclear fusion has been an unfulfilled promise for some 50 years. Even to get this far, researchers have had to overcome formidable technical and scientific barriers. But they hope that ITER will at last prove to doubting politicians and scientific colleagues that nuclear fusion is a viable energy source. If all goes well, funding from ITER's six international partners \u2014 China, the European Union, Japan, South Korea, Russia and the United States \u2014 could be in place this winter, allowing construction to begin in 2006, and operation in 2016. ITER is designed to heat hydrogen to hundreds of millions of degrees centigrade, and then squeeze energy from the resulting plasma, while holding it stable for minutes at a time. Although most fusion researchers agree that the reactor will probably be able to generate more power than it consumes, there are some who believe it may struggle to produce as much energy as predicted, or to hold the plasma stable for as long as hoped. \u201cLike any good scientific experiment, there's a chance that it won't work,\u201d says William Dorland, a theoretical plasma researcher at the University of Maryland in College Park. But ITER is not just any scientific experiment. With construction costs of US$5.5 billion, it will be one of the most expensive scientific facilities ever built on Earth. \u201cITER will do what it's supposed to do and give renewed credibility to the field,\u201d asserts Richard Hazeltine, a plasma physicist at the University of Texas at Austin and head of the Fusion Energy Sciences Advisory Committee for the US Department of Energy. \n               Collision course \n             Fusion is a simple idea that is hard to achieve in practice. Unlike fission, which generates power from the decay of heavy atomic nuclei, fusion occurs when lightweight nuclei, usually from hydrogen, collide with each other and fuse together to form a new element, typically helium. Those collisions are difficult to orchestrate because the positively charged nuclei must overcome their natural repulsion. This only occurs when they are moving very fast or are packed closely together. In other words, you need a very hot, dense plasma to achieve fusion power. The nearest natural source of fusion energy is the Sun. Within its core, gravity pulls positively charged hydrogen nuclei together until they become hot enough and dense enough to fuse into helium. But here on Earth, more inventive solutions are needed. Shortly after the Second World War, scientists in the United States and Russia began to work on machines that might be able to heat and pressurize hydrogen by squeezing the atoms within strong magnetic fields. Scientists experimented with many different machines, each with their own advantages and quirks, but by the 1960s their search had narrowed towards a single design: the tokamak. Developed by Russian physicists Andrei Sakharov and Igor Tamm, the tokamak is a doughnut-shaped machine that uses a series of overlapping magnetic fields to hold a hot, dense plasma within the reactor walls (see graphic). Throughout the 1970s, tokamak technology advanced rapidly, leading many to believe it could be fashioned into a prototype power plant by the start of this century. Those predictions proved to be too optimistic. The energetic hydrogen gas that tokamaks were meant to contain defied confinement by leaking out of its magnetic shackles. Researchers found themselves battling poorly understood plasma instabilities and turbulence, and made slow progress. Even today only one machine, the JT-60 tokamak in Naka, Japan, has begun to approach the \u2018break-even point\u2019 at which as much energy comes out of the device as goes into it. Nevertheless, when ITER was first proposed in 1985, the tokamak design was the obvious choice, says Roberto Andreani, who directs the technical efforts of the European Fusion Development Agreement in Garching, Germany. \u201cIn all the years that we have studied fusion, I would say that the tokamak has been the most reliable,\u201d he says. \u201cIt is the only reasonable choice for ITER.\u201d \n               Fuel for thought \n             ITER's ambitious goal is to hold its hydrogen fuel (a mixture of deuterium and tritium, two isotopes of hydrogen) tightly for between seven and fifteen minutes, while heating it to more than 100 million degrees centigrade and squeezing out about 500 megawatts of energy. The current world record for a sustained high-temperature, high-pressure plasma, held by the JT-60, is 24 seconds. To reach its goals, ITER will use superconducting magnets 25% stronger than those in the Japanese machine, and a host of external heating techniques. ITER's other main advantage will be its size, says Raymond Fonck of the University of Wisconsin at Madison, a member of the ITER design team. Put simply, the more space a hot plasma has to roam, the better it will behave, Fonck explains. With an outer radius of 6.2 metres and a plasma volume of 840 m 3 , ITER will be twice as big as any previous tokamak. But even with its high magnetic fields and enormous size, the machine faces some serious challenges, says Dorland. Unlike previous machines, ITER is designed to release more energy than it takes in, he says. In the past, researchers have been able to control the plasma temperature simply by turning down the heat. But if ITER succeeds, the plasma will burn under the power of its own fusion reactions, and that means researchers will have to learn how to manage the power output. \u201cThe name of the game is to hold a lot of energy into a small place and let it out in a controlled fashion, and that's not easy,\u201d he says. Most of the energy released by ITER will be in the form of fast-moving neutrons, which will irradiate the beryllium-coated blanket surrounding the plasma. Hot helium atoms, the other by-product of fusion reactions, will be captured mainly by the diverter, a carbon-coated structure sitting at the bottom of the tokamak. Not everyone agrees that beryllium \u2014 used in military armour \u2014 and carbon are suited to handling the intense heat and radiation that ITER will release, says Navratil. Tungsten is the likely candidate to replace both in a demonstration power plant to be built after ITER. To aid the search for better structural materials, the Japanese may build a testing facility (see  \u2018Material gains in the east\u2019 ). At some point, a commercial fusion reactor will need to find a way to use the excess heat that is generated. Although ITER is not designed to do this, future machines will be expected to produce useful energy. Most likely, liquid coolants will be used to cool the blanket and diverter, and the hot coolant leaving the reactor will be used to heat water, which in turn will drive steam turbines. A big uncertainty with ITER's design is the proliferation of helium inside the reactor. Previous tokamak experiments have produced small amounts of fusion, and so small amounts of helium and neutrons. But this time, ITER will fill with substantially more hot helium, and how that will interact with the rest of the plasma could be unpredictable, says Stewart Prager of the University of Wisconsin and another US physicist on the ITER design team. The researchers also worry about the walls accumulating too much radioactive tritium, on which there are strict limits for safety reasons. It is questions like these that caused ITER to scale back its original plan. The machine was initially slated to be twice as big again, capable of holding burning hydrogen for several hours at a time and releasing some 1,500 megawatts of power. But governments were uneasy about the projected costs, and that, together with technical uncertainties raised by Dorland and others, caused a redesign with more modest goals and a smaller price tag. Some of the technical concerns resulted from numerical simulations of plasma turbulence, which have greatly improved over the past ten years. But uncertainty remains about how hot the outside of the plasma will be, says Dorland, and this will ultimately affect how well ITER functions. \n               Heated debate \n             Partly because of better modelling, most researchers agree that the smaller, cheaper ITER can be made to work. \u201cIn Europe we're optimistic about the future of fusion,\u201d says David Ward, a plasma physicist who studies the economics of fusion for the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority in Culham near Oxford. \u201cBut the big step will be going from where we are to ITER.\u201d Ward says that the reactor will provide definitive proof of the value of fusion power, as well as offering technical information about how to build a first-generation commercial reactor. Dorland agrees, with one caveat: \u201cI think that ITER will work, but I'm willing to bet you $100 that another fusion device will get more power out before it does,\u201d he says. There are perhaps half-a-dozen designs that might catch up with tokamaks, but the most impressive to date, he says, is a variation of the tokamak called the spherical torus. This more closely resembles a pitted apple than a doughnut, a shape that allows it to create a sharp boundary between the hot hydrogen plasma and the outer wall of the reactor and squeeze the plasma more tightly. Such a design might achieve a burning fusion reaction with less fuss than the more cumbersome tokamak, he says. Even so, those who have been in the fusion business a long time believe that it is better to go ahead with ITER than to hope another device will get there first, says Hazeltine. Decades of promises and billions in investment have left international fusion research in what he describes as a fragile condition. \u201cFusion science is on the edge of vanishing,\u201d he says. \u201cI think we need to go ahead and turn this damn thing on.\u201d \n                     Japan consoled with contracts as France snares fusion project \n                   \n                     Time for a belated rethink of fusion's goals \n                   \n                     Fusion project back on track as US returns to the fold \n                   \n                     France and Japan lock horns in battle to host research reactor \n                   \n                     ITER \n                   \n                     Cadarache \n                   \n                     More on fusion \n                   \n                     IFMIF \n                   \n                     JAERI \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Phyllida Brown reports. Sometimes it's hard to be a scientist. Just five years ago, Mihaela Skobe, a molecular biologist now at Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York, and her team were struggling to publish their work on the lymphatic system. Editors and reviewers thought it boring. The polite but yawning rejection letters came. \u201cThey would say that everything in the paper was fine but that lymphatics were unimportant,\u201d says Skobe. \u201cThere was a complete lack of interest.\u201d Not any more. Once dismissed as a mere drainage network, the body's \u2018second circulation\u2019 system (see Graphic, below) is emerging as a crucial player in numerous diseases from cancer to asthma, and as a vital part of the normal immune system. As a result of these discoveries, researchers are trying to intervene in its activities, for example to reduce the spread of tumours, to boost the efficiency of vaccines, or to treat the painful and disfiguring swelling known as lymphoedema. \u201cIt's a hot field now,\u201d says Michael Detmar, a dermatologist and lymphatic system researcher at Harvard Medical School in Boston, Massachusetts. These days, he says, many laboratories are switching from the study of blood vessels to the lymphatic system. Detmar is one of several researchers showing how important the lymphatic system is for tumour spread. Other groups are finding it plays a key role in inflammatory diseases such as asthma or transplant rejection. \u201cWe are in the pioneering phase,\u201d says Detmar. \u201cThere is a feeling that there is still so much to discover.\u201d \n               Mystery vessels \n             It might seem strange that one of the body's major organs is  terra incognita . Lymphatic vessels may be drains, but they are pretty sophisticated ones. Not only do they collect fluid that has leaked into tissues from the bloodstream and return it to the blood; they also process that fluid, sending it through lymph nodes where key cells of the immune system, called dendritic cells, present fragments of foreign molecules to other cells to mount an immune response. But the fact is that the lymphatic system has played second fiddle to the blood system for centuries. Only properly discovered in the 1600s (see  A brief history of our second circulation ), it faded into obscurity and, apart from a brief flurry of interest around 1900, was largely neglected until about ten years ago. The turning point came in the early 1990s when Kari Alitalo, a cancer researcher at the University of Helsinki, began studying a family of proteins involved in generating new blood vessels. These proteins, called vascular endothelial growth factors, or VEGFs, stimulate the growth of cells lining blood vessels and enable new vessels to sprout. Tumours often subvert these signals to build a blood supply that nourishes their invading mass. Like other scientists, Alitalo reasoned that if these signals, or the receptor proteins that enable cells to receive them were blocked, blood vessels could be prevented from growing, and tumours could be starved to death. But what Alitalo and his team discovered next was to lead their focus away from blood-vessel growth signals and into the backwater of the lymphatic system. He and his team happened upon a new VEGF receptor that was present mainly on the cells that line the insides of lymphatic vessels 1 . The receptor was similar to a known receptor for VEGFs but neither of the two members of this family, VEGF-A or VEGF-B, activated it. So the hunt for the signal was on. \n               High hopes \n             When they eventually found this signal, they discovered that it was an endothelial growth factor similar to the known VEGFs. They named it VEGF-C and the receptor VEGF receptor 3 (ref.  2 ). In mice that had been genetically engineered to express excessive amounts of VEGF-C, the lymphatic vessels proliferated but \u2014 crucially \u2014 the blood vessels did not. This was the first signal known to act specifically on the lymphatic system 3 . Meanwhile, on the other side of the world, Marc Achen and Steven Stacker at the Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, Melbourne, were hunting for further VEGFs. Faxes flew from Melbourne to Helsinki and back. Together, the researchers soon identified another signal that also acted on VEGF receptor 3. This one was dubbed, not surprisingly, VEGF-D (ref.  4 ). \u201cIt was very exciting,\u201d says Alitalo. He and the Australians hoped that their discoveries could eventually lead to treatments to help build new lymphatic vessels in people suffering from lymphoedema \u2014 for example after breast cancer surgery. But progress was hampered by the fact that there were no \u2018markers\u2019 for the lymphatic system. These are proteins characteristic of the tissue being studied that scientists use to specifically target dyes, and so to see the tissue more easily. It was not until 1999, when David Jackson, a biochemist at the Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine in Oxford, discovered such a marker, a protein called LYVE-1 (ref.  5 ), that lymphatic research really went into orbit. For one thing, researchers could now probe the role of the lymphatic system in the spread of cancerous tumours. Many tumours, such as breast cancer and melanoma, spread from the original tumour via the lymphatic system to other organs, and a person's prognosis is worse if lymph nodes are involved. Yet, although the role of blood vessels in tumour spread had been well studied, researchers knew almost nothing about whether tumour cells actively persuaded lymphatic vessels to grow and assist their spread or whether lymphatics were just passive ducts. Alitalo's group, together with Michael Pepper at the University of Geneva Medical Centre, and Gerhard Christofori at the Research Institute of Molecular Pathology in Vienna, created genetically engineered mice that developed tumours in the pancreas and had abnormally high levels of VEGF-C in the same organ. The team found lymphatic vessels sprouting in the animals' tumours. What is more, the animals' lymphatic vessels often contained tumour cells that had originated in the pancreas 6 . Other teams also found evidence pointing the finger at the lymphatic system as an active agent in spreading tumours. Detmar and Skobe transplanted human breast cancers, engineered to make a lot of VEGF-C, into mice, and found lymphatic vessels sprouting within the transplanted tumours. Indeed, the greater the degree of lymph-vessel growth, the more the tumours spread in the animals' lymph nodes and lungs 7 . There is now little doubt that the interplay between tumours and the lymphatic system is the main route used by solid cancers to spread. There is now little doubt that this interplay between tumours and the lymphatic system is the main route used by solid cancers to spread. But could clinicians one day intervene to stop it? Quite possibly. Stacker and Achen and colleagues from Melbourne showed that VEGF-D was, like VEGF-C, capable of triggering lymphatic vessels to grow inside transplanted tumours in mice. It also increased the spread of tumours to lymph nodes. But when VEGF-D was blocked, this increased spread could be checked 8 . Alitalo's group meanwhile, showed that mice genetically engineered to have VEGF-C and VEGF-D signalling blocked could not make new lymphatic vessels; their existing vessels even shrank 9 . The team then blocked VEGF-C and VEGF-D signalling in mice with human-breast-tumour transplants, and found it could reduce the amount of tumour spread by two-thirds 10 . The implications were clear: if VEGF-C and VEGF-D could be blocked in a mouse, then perhaps they could also be blocked in people with cancer to help prevent tumour spread. \n               Mice to men \n             Evidence shows that tumours in people behave like those in mice. Across a range of different human tumours, those that contain high levels of VEGF-C or VEGF-D are more likely to spread 11 . As a general rule, the more lymphatic vessels there are in the tumour, the greater the risk. Stacker and Achen are hopeful that trials testing agents that block VEGF-C and VEGF-D can begin soon. After all, points out Achen, an antibody called bevacizumab, or Avastin, that slows the growth of blood vessels in spreading colon cancer by blocking VEGF-A, has already prolonged some patients' lives. But Alitalo warns that such trials may be a long time coming. One problem, he says, is that tumour spread can be a slow process, and pharmaceutical companies are wary of embarking on costly trials that take as long as three years to reveal results. As if all this were not news enough, it seems that the lymphatic system has been hiding an even bigger surprise up its sleeve. Over the past year, several research teams have begun to uncover evidence that the lymphatic system could be a major culprit in unwanted inflammation. Inflammation plays a key role in asthma, which affects an estimated five million people in Britain alone. It is also associated with other common conditions including psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis, and with some medical problems such as transplant rejection. Dontscho Kerjaschki, a pathologist at the Medical University of Vienna, has been studying what happens when kidney transplants are rejected. Normally, the kidney cortex, the part that filters blood, has hardly any lymphatic vessels. But in about a third of biopsies from transplanted kidneys, Kerjaschki found a 50-fold increase in the number of lymphatic vessels 12 . In most cases, such biopsies came from patients with chronic rejection, a condition in which the graft continues to be attacked by the host's immune system after initial immunosuppression treatment, until the transplant breaks down. Kerjaschki thinks the unusually extensive lymphatics could be involved, speculating that they may bring a continual supply of immune cells into the graft. \u201cMaybe the lymphatics are organizing the whole catastrophe,\u201d he says. Hints that the lymphatics can mastermind an immune response come from the discovery of a protein called podoplanin by Kerjaschki's team. Podoplanin sticks to a signalling mol-ecule called CCL21, which is found mainly in lymphatic vessels. CCL21 is a powerful attractant to immune cells such as dendritic cells and macrophages 13 . In kidney grafts, where some inflammatory cells are already present, the complex of CCL21 and podoplanin breaks down, releasing CCL21 into the vessel, and so attracting further inflammatory cells. \n               Key controllers \n             Another piece of the jigsaw implicating lymphatic vessels in harmful immune responses comes from Donald McDonald, a vascular biologist at the University of California, San Francisco, and his colleagues. They have studied a mouse model of asthma. The animals' lungs are chronically infected with  Mycoplasma pulmonis , a bacterial infection that produces swelling of the mucous membranes, alterations to vessel linings and scarring \u2014 all symptoms that resemble those of human asthma. McDonald's group found that infected mice grew additional lymphatic vessels in their tracheas, and their airway blood vessels also proliferated. When the team treated the mice with antibiotics, the blood vessels shrank but the extra lymphatic vessels persisted 14 . \u201cThis was a surprise,\u201d says McDonald. He speculates that the new lymphatic vessels help to set the lung up for more rapid and accentuated immune responses to subsequent infections, exacerbating inflammation. His team is now looking at the signalling molecules involved, hoping that it may eventually be possible to manipulate the inflammatory immune responses to help control asthma. Back in Helsinki, where it all began, Alitalo is upbeat. He is happy that there are still fundamental questions to answer, including how cancer cells move beyond the lymph nodes as they travel through the vessels to distant organs, and how exactly tumour cells enter lymphatic vessels in the first place. And Skobe? She and her team are getting to grips with the molecules in lymphatic vessels that are involved in tumour spread. Skobe is not giving away details of her latest work yet. But when she does have new results to report, it seems unlikely, this time around, that the journal editors will need convincing. \n                     Nature Reviews Immunology 4, 35-45 (2004); doi:10.1038/nri1258 \n                   \n                     Nature Medicine 9, 166 - 168 (2003) doi:10.1038/nm0203-166 \n                   \n                     Nature Medicine 7, 151 - 152 (2001) doi:10.1038/84579 \n                   \n                     Lymphodema Support Network \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Nature 's reporters have asked researchers just why the process is so frustrating, and what can be done to improve matters. Physicists find it exasperating. Cell biologists say it drives them crazy. Some even want to quit science because of it. When it comes to applying for grants from funding agencies, researchers of every persuasion describe the process as time-consuming and stressful. For many, it is the worst part of their job. So when  Nature  journalists began asking scientists about their experiences with grant applications about a year ago, we were not surprised to hear some horror stories. Many researchers were reluctant to talk, understandably wary of biting the hand that feeds them. But others spoke of interminable delays, confusing application forms and acts of bureaucratic incompetence that threatened to derail careers. We've collected the most revealing stories here, together with thoughts from researchers and agencies on how to ease the pain. Wasted time topped the list of complaints. Researchers from Europe, Asia and the United States all spoke of the frustrations that come when grants are delayed, but the most striking example came from Jens Schmidt, a chemist at a German university. Like most of the researchers who talked to  Nature , he did so on condition that his story was presented under a different name. The German Federal Ministry of Education and Research says that the average processing time for a grant application is six months. Schmidt's experience is somewhat different. His application was praised from the first review onwards, yet it still took two-and-a-half years to get funded. The saga began in April 2000, when Schmidt submitted an outline for a grant request of \u20ac150,000 (US$186,000) for an environmental science project. The reply took eight months to arrive, but contained positive reviews that encouraged him to submit a full application in early 2001. That did not receive a reply until October, when the reviewers were again enthusiastic \u2014 perhaps too much so. Given such good reviews, Schmidt was asked to extend the proposed project from two to three years, requiring him to submit a third application. But after doing so in early 2002, the ministry said it did not have enough money for a three-year project. A slimmed-down application number four was duly submitted, and funding eventually arrived in October 2002. By this time, the laptop Schmidt had bought for the project was no longer capable of running the software required for his work. At least his ideas were not out of date. Next on the list of application annoyances came the bureaucratic burdens associated with accounting for how grant money is spent. Researchers recognize that accounts are needed to prevent fraud, but say that research agencies often lack a sense of perspective when it comes to tracking spending. \n               Called to account \n             France's notoriously bureaucratic research agencies and universities often require scientists to supply evidence of several competing tenders before purchasing basic items, right down to lab reagents. Onerous accounts are just one of many aspects of European Union grants that drive researchers to distraction (see  \u2018Paper, paper, everywhere...\u2019 ). But when it comes to over-the-top accounting, Japan seems to steal the show. Grantees from the health ministry, for example, must keep track of changes to the ministry's accounting rules by buying annual copies of a 445-page guidebook for US$32. And the country's education ministry insists that its funds are used by the end of the financial year in which they were issued, unless the delays were caused by unforeseen events such as an earthquake. Any yen not accounted for must be returned. Kazunari Taira, a professor of biological chemistry at the University of Tokyo who was happy for  Nature  to use his real name, recently discovered just how petty his country's bureaucracy could be. Last year, he received \u00a550 million (US$450,000) in government funds. Under plans to make Japan's research institutes more independent, the university was entrusted to manage the grant, with some bizarre consequences. When Taira's secretaries asked university officials if they could purchase pens and erasers for the office, they were instructed that such supplies were to be used only in connection with the grant in question. The university denies this, saying it merely assumes that researchers already have pens and would \u201clike them not to buy them again\u201d. Either way, absurd accounting wins over common sense. Arbitrary rules such as these may raise a sigh \u2014 but flawed funding decisions can have much more serious consequences. Most scientists need to win competitive grants to keep their careers going. If the application process is mishandled, they can fall behind in the race to publish or, in extreme cases, be forced out of a field altogether. The latter almost happened to Hugh Roberts. Last year, the UK-based immunologist, who asked  Nature  not to use his real name, was facing a tough career decision. During eight years of postdoc work, Roberts had authored well-received papers in top journals. \u201cMy CV was as good as anyone's,\u201d he says. But he was struggling to make the transition to group leader. Some UK agencies offered career-development grants for this purpose, but the schemes were restricted to applicants with no more than six years' postdoctoral experience. At the age of 34, Roberts felt he was still a young scientist, \u201cbut I was being told I was over the hill\u201d. Then a potential solution appeared. The Medical Research Council (MRC), the body that distributes most UK government money for biomedical projects, removed the time limit for one of its grants. Roberts was able to apply for a three-year award of \u00a3250,000 (US$460,000), which he planned to use to set up a lab. The university where he worked was keen to keep him and agreed to pay his salary. To reduce applicant numbers, the MRC decreed that any university could put forward no more than three people. So Robert's institute set up an internal competition, requiring researchers to submit an eight-page proposal and give a ten-minute talk. He won and submitted an application to the MRC in May. \u201cOn and off it was the main thing I was doing for a month,\u201d he says. Roberts was philosophical when told in October that he had not been successful, as he knew there had been more than 120 applications for just 20 grants. \u201cIt was tough, but I didn't mind losing in those circumstances,\u201d he says. Until, that is, he received his rejection letter from the MRC, and saw the basis on which it had made its decision: a single review from a scientist who, judging by a copy of the review seen by  Nature , held strong views that were not representative of the field. With no recourse to appeal the decision, Roberts felt let down by the MRC. \u201cThey never really gave the grant a chance,\u201d says Roberts. \n               Feeling rejected \n             Tales of accounting rules and bureaucratic delays seem trivial compared with this disappointment. Roberts would not be the first unsuccessful applicant to blame the review process, but by relying on a single reviewer, instead of the usual three, the MRC seems to have erred. Researchers who sit on grant panels confirm that it is very rare for applications to be dismissed on the basis of a single review. Peter Dukes, a programme manager at the MRC's London offices, insists that the case is not representative of \u201cthe standard to which we work\u201d. There was a happy ending for Roberts \u2014 he has since obtained a position at his university that will allow him to set up a lab. Some of the work outlined in the grant has been completed and published in prestigious journals. But, looking back, Roberts recalls how he thought about quitting science when the MRC application was rejected. Bureaucratic failings could have cost Britain a talented scientist. \n               A better way? \n             As much as researchers would like to be funded without the hassles of peer review, none would argue in favour of actually distributing public research money in this manner. Funding agencies need to make scientists justify their ideas to make sure that the money goes to the right people. But they also need to minimize the pain involved. How can they avoid some of the incidents mentioned here? In many cases, US organizations lead the way. In the mid-1990s, the National Science Foundation introduced FastLane, an online application procedure that has won praise for saving researchers' time, in part because the system automatically picks up problems with formatting issues. Other US agencies are following suit, and eventually all applications to federal funders will be processed through a single website. British researchers have given the thumbs up to a similar website introduced by the country's research councils last year, and Germany's main granting agency, the DFG, has plans for the same sort of approach. Agencies that aren't exploring such possibilities, including some of Japan's government ministries, are beginning to look like the odd ones out. Other US initiatives have also earned praise, in particular the frequency with which staff attend conferences and talk to scientists. One climate researcher, for example, says that she meets officials from US funding organizations more often than she does their UK counterparts, even though she is based in Britain and receives funding from British agencies. \u201cWe manage to have only a few days out of the office every month,\u201d acknowledges Dukes. He points out that all UK research councils work under a tough cap on the money they can spend on staff activities rather than grants. Instead, Dukes says, the MRC is exploring how internal reforms could help existing staff to get out more. \u201cWe want to do better,\u201d he says. But the reforms that generated the most plaudits were those that reduced the number of forms, instruction documents and guidelines that researchers have to plough through. This summer, for example, the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) assessed the impact of a simple change it made six years ago. Applicants who ask for less than $250,000 in research costs have to describe their project in detail, plus how much funding they require, but the detailed accounting is handled later on at the applicant's research institution. More than 80% of scientists surveyed about the change say they were satisfied with the policy and about three-quarters of applicants to the NIH's most commonly sought grant, the R01, no longer supply detailed costs in advance. Peer reviewers were similarly enthusiastic, saying that the changes helped them to focus on the pros and cons of the grant itself. Perhaps most importantly, peer reviewers say the process reduced the administrative burden that comes with acting as a referee. If the NIH system has a failing, say researchers, it is the length of the application forms. For example, a research outline in an R01 can run to 25 pages. NIH officials say that this is the maximum allowed and that scientists are free to write less. But the psychology of application behaviour seems to dictate that researchers fill all the available space in the hope of winning over reviewers. Simply cutting the length of the form could save time, suggest researchers who have applied for grants elsewhere. In Britain, for example, the equivalent of the R01 involves a form that is a maximum of eight pages long. When it comes to the grant types on offer, researchers also say that fewer is better. The MRC has recently reduced the number of grant types it offers but made them more flexible, so that researchers can apply for different durations of support, for example. Dukes says the plans are generating positive feedback. Contrast that with the situation in Japan, where the number of different grant types rose from 28 in 2004 to 37 this year. In many cases, successful reforms follow a simple recipe: scientists like it when agencies are open, accessible and make the effort to understand them. As one university official who helps researchers with grants notes, it makes a big difference simply to provide a telephone helpdesk that is manned by people (see  \u2018The inside track\u2019 ). Scientists also like it when agency staff come to conferences and visit labs, or convene focus groups to ask their opinion on agency practices. Most of all, they like it when agencies actually act on the feedback they are given. Grant applications may be the bane of many scientists' working lives. But they need not be, as research agencies who listen and respond are finding. \n                     Reduced grants set off short fuses among US scientists \n                   \n                     Universities unnerved by revised rules for sharing NIH research \n                   \n                     Medical research wins simpler grants and extra cash \n                   \n                     US federal grants \n                   \n                     UK research councils grants \n                   \n                     European Union Framework Programme \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Nicola Jones joins them for a few days, and asks what physiologists hope to learn from this marathon lie-in. I'm staring at the ceiling and my feet are strapped to an exercise machine that acts like a giant yo-yo. My head rests a few centimetres lower than my feet, my face is bright red and my calves are screaming in pain as Bj\u00f6rn Alkner, trained in physiology and physical education, yells at me to push the last set of repetitions to the maximum. The exercise session ends and, unstrapped, I give in to the overwhelming desire to stand up and stretch. Instantly, I feel dizzy and my head pounds. Perhaps I'm not cut out for this. I've been here for just half an hour, but in the other rooms of this squat building at Toulouse's Rangueil Hospital lie women who have signed up to submit themselves to such procedures for two months \u2014 during which time they won't be able to sit or stand at all. These volunteers will be pumped full of glucose, fed protein drinks, jabbed for blood samples and muscle biopsies, given electrical stimulation to make their muscles twitch, asked to run on a vertical treadmill, and much more. With no apparent irony, the researchers running this international project describe the experience as \u2018bedrest\u2019. They may seem like sadists, but the leaders of the project \u2014 run by MEDES, the French Institute for Space Medicine and Physiology in Toulouse \u2014 have a serious purpose. If astronauts are to spend longer stints in orbit, or make the 30-month return trip to Mars, we need more data on how the body responds to microgravity \u2014 and how to mitigate its damaging effects on our physiology. Bedrest studies have for decades been used to mimic the weightlessness of space, but there is still much to learn; particularly about women, who have been under-represented in these experiments. \n               Difficult position \n             So the dozen volunteers in Toulouse are pioneers. \u201cThey are doing it for the sense of adventure,\u201d says MEDES project scientist Marie-Pierre Bareille. They certainly aren't in it for the money. Each volunteer will get \u20ac15,000 (US$18,000) in instalments over four years. But it's a strange kind of adventure: the closest these women will get to the International Space Station (ISS) this summer is looking at its photo on the wall of the exercise room. For 60 days, they will lie with their heads at a 6\u00b0 downwards slant, while they eat, shower... do everything, in fact. There are even discreet cameras in place to ensure that they don't cheat. Despite this, the volunteers are enthusiastic. \u201cThe last time I thought about being an astronaut was when I was five years old,\u201d says the recumbent Dorota Tataruch, a 25-year-old student from Poland. \u201cBut all this is fascinating \u2014 talking to the scientists; seeing how we respond psychologically. I'm glad I'm here.\u201d Lying down with your head lower than your feet may seem a poor imitation of the conditions in space, but it has many of the same physiological effects. After a few hours, blood and other fluids shift towards the head, making for a puffy face and headaches. After a day or so, the body responds to the increased volume of fluid in the upper torso: astronauts and bedrest volunteers quickly lose up to a litre of urine. Meanwhile, the lack of stimulation to balance sensors in the ears and nerves in the soles of the feet can cause dizziness and nausea. Astronauts can experience debilitating space sickness, and bedrest volunteers sometimes get a milder vertigo \u2014 usually relieved, for unknown reasons, by gently shaking the sufferer's head. Leg and back muscles begin to atrophy \u2014 calf muscles can shrink by up to 30% within a few months, with a 50% reduction in some measures of leg strength. Every month, up to 2% of bone in the same areas is lost. As calcium leaches out, there's an increased risk of kidney stones. Without exercise, the body's control of blood glucose goes awry, potentially leading to insulin resistance. And without the effort of having to pump blood against gravity, the heart muscles shrink and \u2018forget\u2019 this crucial aspect of their function. Even with two hours of exercise a day and a good diet, astronauts return to Earth severely weakened after a few months in space. \u201cWe have some crew members who can't get out of their seats or walk,\u201d says Jeffrey Jones, head of NASA's medical operations for exploration missions at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas. Most bedrest studies to date have focused on changes in blood flow, bone and muscle mass. This study will also look at these effects, but with a few novel twists \u2014 including the gender make-up of the study group. Although there is no reason to think that female physiological responses to rest are radically different from men's, there are bound to be hormonal differences. And there are hints that women might faint more easily after a period in low gravity than men. \n               Undercover agents \n             The 12 women in the study have been split into three groups \u2014 one to explore the effects of exercise, one to test a high-protein diet, and the other serving as a control. But all face mental challenges. \u201cBoredom and privacy are the first issues. Then you expect some to become short-tempered,\u201d says Fran\u00e7ois-R\u00e9gis Lenoir, a psychological counsellor on the trial. After 1,600 enquiries and 240 serious applications, only the most mentally and physically fit were selected. Still, there are bound to be difficulties. Tataruch's roommate had her 30th birthday while lying down, and all the team could do to celebrate was to wheel her outside for a bit of sunshine. At times, Tataruch and her nutrition-testing colleagues have been desperate to go for a run. At least the exercise group has some sort of release. These women are testing two devices: the first is the yo-yo contraption I struggled with. This works like the squat-machines found in most gyms, although instead of lifting weights, you pull against the resistance of a nylon strap wrapped around a spindle. This exercises the thighs and calves, especially prone to muscle loss in space. The device performed well in a bedrest study with men, reportedly being both more effective and comfortable than the machines currently on the ISS \u2014 which include a stationary bike and a treadmill that astronauts attach themselves to with bungee cords. \u201cThey're designing a model to test on the ISS now,\u201d says Alkner. The second device is a vertical treadmill encased in a plastic box. The women are inserted into it sideways and air is extracted, which sucks the feet onto the jogging surface. This also pulls the blood to the feet, forcing the heart to work harder. It's an odd sensation being trussed up and swung into the device. Then the pump comes on and my feet hit the treadmill with a thud. It feels strange, but it works: now I'm running up the wall. Through about an hour of such exercises each day, researchers hope that the active group will retain 100% of their leg muscles \u2014 a feat never yet achieved. The second experimental group is testing the idea that muscle loss can be minimized simply by eating a high-protein diet laced with extra leucine \u2014 an amino acid thought to be crucial to muscle building. \u201cThis should halve the amount of muscle loss,\u201d says Gianni Biolo from the University of Trieste in Italy, who is principal investigator on the project. The leucine comes in powdered form. Added to water, it tastes foul. Maintaining muscle mass and tone is one thing, but the effects of microgravity or bedrest on our nervous system and balance are harder to tackle. \u201cThat's our greatest weakness. It would be great if people focused more on that,\u201d says Jones. The Toulouse researchers will be looking at how some of our nerves and leg muscles work together through reflexes to help us walk without stumbling or falling over \u2014 using electrical stimulation, they will monitor how these reactions change with rest. \n               Bedside manner \n             Other project scientists are examining the effects of simulated microgravity on everything from the immune system to mental acuity. But the volunteers seem strangely subdued in the face of all this poking and prodding. They read, write e-mails or chat to each other. Counsellors and massage therapists are on hand to attend to any psychological and physical niggles. When I call Tataruch from London to find out how her two months of \u2018rest\u2019 went, she is in good humour. \u201cIt passed much quicker than I expected,\u201d she says. Full results from the experiments won't be available for a while, but the diet and exercise regimes seem, from Tataruch's account, to have had the desired effect. Members of the control group managed to stand, albeit with a few wobbles, and painful backs and feet. Tataruch's leg muscles are visibly larger than theirs, she says, although smaller than those in the exercise group. Now Taturach faces a month of rehabilitation, to get back into sports and \u2014 she can't wait for this \u2014 real food. She says that the experience has prompted her to think about applying for astronaut training when she becomes eligible in a few years' time. In the meantime, the same scientists are looking for more participants for bedrest.

Kendall Powell catches up with some of the first pupils to graduate from \u2018nerd school\u2019. Sixteen years ago this month John Wilson, Heather Stevens and Rod Rippey graduated with the first class of Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology in Alexandria, Virginia. On a recent Monday evening, in a tavern 15 minutes from their alma mater, they reminisced about their days at the science magnet school. \u201cI was a super-geek in eighth grade, programming in Basic and Logo on my Apple II Plus,\u201d remembers Wilson. \u201cI told my parents, there's this high school where everyone is geeky like me.\u201d He pauses, then, \u201cHey, remember Karel the Robot?\u201d Stevens groans and explains that Karel was a pseudolanguage for teaching computer programming. \u201cYou know, it could only turn left, so to get it to turn right, you had to program in \u2018turn left, turn left, turn left\u2019 \u2014 that was when I decided I was not going into computer science,\u201d she says. Everyone chuckles \u2014 Stevens now works for a software-developing firm in Fairfax, Virginia. Rippey comes back to the gathering's topic, \u201cJefferson was designed for me. I didn't fit in at my middle school.\u201d But although Wilson and Rippey jumped at the chance to attend high school with other self-confessed geeks, Stevens went grudgingly at her parents' request. \u201cI had an aptitude in science, but I didn't necessarily like it,\u201d she recalls. \n               It  \n               is \n                rocket science \n             Two decades ago, some of the first science, maths and technology magnet high schools opened in the United States. The Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy (IMSA) in Aurora, outside Chicago, was established the same year as Jefferson in 1985. The magnet concept caught on quickly as a way to challenge the best young minds, and as a possible answer to the decline in US-produced scientists and engineers. There are now 86 science magnet schools nationwide, which select gifted children with an aptitude for science. Australia, Jordan, Israel, Korea, Thailand, Japan and the United Kingdom have set up similar science-focused schools. But is it a mistake to immerse students in the sciences at the age of 14 or 15? By the time they reach graduate school, such students have already spent eight years in focused study. Is \u2018nerd\u2019 school a place where overachievers bloom while others wilt under the pressure? Or would their talents be undernourished at a \u2018normal\u2019 high school? Graduates of the high-tech highs give a range of answers. \u201cIt was highly competitive and many thrived on it,\u201d says Wilson. \u201cI've never been among so many ridiculous brainiacs since.\u201d He, Rippey and Stevens left Jefferson with widely different impressions and goals, but they all ended up in technical careers. At Jefferson, Wilson soon realized his computer talents paled in comparison with those of others. He shifted to biology and eventually became a psychiatrist working for Fairfax county's mental health department. Rippey's interest in electronics carried him through Jefferson and a college degree in electrical engineering. He has since worked for government military contractors, and at one point was literally a rocket scientist. \u201cI've always been surrounded by really smart people,\u201d he says, high school being just the beginning. But Stevens did not thrive on the competition. Instead, she says, she felt like the dumbest kid in school and describes it as the worst four years of her life. \u201cSchool killed my interest in science. I was already burnt-out when I got to college,\u201d she recalls. After college, she rebelled by taking a job at a customs brokerage firm. \u201cI was the smartest person in the company and moved up fast \u2014 it was definitely not rocket science,\u201d she says with a nod to Rippey. \u201cI needed that time to feel smart,\u201d she adds. Eventually, her technical abilities led to a career in software. \n               Go team \n             The friendship between Jefferson graduates Matt Appler and Peter Hesse is underscored by healthy competition. They took a physics class together in college that turned into a two-man challenge. \u201cAnd I won,\u201d Appler gloated over burgers recently. \u201cYeah, but you're two years older than me,\u201d rebuts Hesse. Each now runs a computer-security company. Competition inevitably arises when overachieving students are placed under one roof. \u201cThese students are driven from within,\u201d says IMSA principal Eric McLaren. \u201cWe knew that we had to foster collaboration and downplay competition.\u201d As such, both Jefferson and the IMSA do not calculate class ranks and have no valedictorian. McLaren says his teachers promote group, rather than individual, efforts. Team projects and student-led learning methods dominate at magnet schools, where pupils operate far above textbook level. Schooldays tend to be longer and frequently stretch to 12 hours with extracurricular activities and research projects. Schedules run in modules to accommodate in-depth labs and classes lasting up to two hours. \n               Bright young things \n             Ande Croll, an IMSA graduate, recalls an interactive physics lesson. Her instructor took the class outside and had them practise throwing spiral passes with an American football. The mechanics lesson on why the spiral improves the pass \u201csticks with you\u201d, says Croll, a mechanical engineer who now designs electronics for fighter jets in Rockford, Illinois. This discovery-based learning is everywhere in Jefferson today. In Paul Cammer's biology class, students form a discussion circle. Cammer has posted an observation about ladybird beetles for the students to explain. He sits at the centre of their circle, nudging plausible ideas forward but rarely intervening. The students lead the debate, and seem unafraid of suggesting crazy ideas or looking stupid. Cammer keeps them working within reasonable constraints of modern-day research, too. \u201cRemember, you don't have $3 billion from the National Science Foundation. You are a high-school student working with beetles in your attic.\u201d The students arrive at a reasonable and testable hypothesis 45 minutes later \u2014 in some ways, functioning like they are halfway through graduate school. \u201cThe classes at the IMSA taught you how to think,\u201d says Scott Gaudi, an astronomy postdoctoral fellow at the Harvard\u2013Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge, Massachusetts. \u201cOur classes were: \u2018Here's a problem or something that happened in history, now try to find out why it happened that way\u2019,\u201d he says. \u201cThis is the way we do research.\u201d Gaudi, who searches for planets beyond our Solar System, was named one of the top-20 scientists to watch in the next 20 years by  Discover  magazine. \u201cI would have probably been in astronomy without the IMSA, but I would be nowhere near as successful,\u201d he says. The IMSA and Jefferson both require students to do research projects during their senior year, either in the school labs or with local universities or businesses. Only a handful of alumni have become academics, albeit in greater numbers than your average school. But most of them do work in science- or technology-based jobs. In general terms, magnet schools go a long way towards increasing the country's technical workforce. \u201cAt a time when the United States is producing fewer and fewer scientists, engineers and mathematicians, the IMSA's doing it. It seems like the school sends more students out every year to do jobs that are technology-based,\u201d says Michael Brody, an IMSA graduate and now a Homeland Security policy adviser for the state of Illinois. The numbers support his claim. Two-thirds of IMSA graduates earn a degree in science, maths or technology. For females, that is four times the national average. About 40% of alumni earn a graduate degree, with healthcare and computer professions as the top career fields. \n               Repelled by magnets \n             But science magnet schools are not for everyone. Chris Colin, a writer and Jefferson graduate, tracked down half the class of 1993 for a book about his classmates. Many of his peers had, like himself, struggled to find careers outside science. \u201cAt 14, I didn't know what the hell I was doing,\u201d he says. Colin says the tunnel vision at Jefferson hindered thinking about other interests and career choices. Bettie Stegall, a veteran English teacher, uses her creative writing class to push her students to stretch the other side of their brains. The day I visit, her announcement about a poetry assignment receives collective groans. But some of her students say they wish they had more opportunities to take music, business and other non-science courses. One laments that she had to take summer school twice to fit music into her schedule of required science classes. She plans to major in music at the University of California, Berkeley, in the autumn. \u201cBut at another school I probably would have fallen in with the wrong crowd,\u201d she admits. Two-thirds of the seniors say they would not have chosen Jefferson again, but it's likely that some will change their minds once school is behind them. Many of the alumni blossomed at Jefferson. Hesse and Appler continue to challenge each other as their firms expand and their toddlers play together. \u201cI would absolutely encourage my kids to go there,\u201d says Appler. \u201cJefferson brought you out thinking you could do anything.\u201d Did these alumni also have \u2018normal\u2019 high-school experiences? Sure: Brody was elected to the Prom Court, Rippey and Wilson were both on the running team and a senior-year prank involved assembling a Volkswagen Beetle inside the school lounge. It didn't hurt to have nerdy football cheers to confuse opponents, either. Stevens chants the final bit over dinner: \u201cSecant-Tangent-Sine-Cosine. Three-point-one-four-one-five-nine!\u201d (That's pi for the rest of us). \n                     Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology \n                   \n                     Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy \n                   \n                     National Consortium for Specialized Secondary Schools of Mathematics, Science and Technology \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Duncan Graham-Rowe reports from this pariah state. In March 1997, Chris Wemmer, a biologist with the Smithsonian National Zoological Park in Washington DC, received an alarming fax. It was an article from the British  Observer  newspaper accusing him of colluding with the Burmese junta in committing human rights abuses in the country now known as Myanmar. The article, headlined \u201cSave the rhino, kill the people\u201d, implicated Wemmer's organization in the murder and forced removal of ethnic Karen people to make way for a huge wildlife park, called the Myinmoletkhat Reserve. It criticized the Smithsonian Institution for being one of the first Western organizations to work with the regime \u201csince it massacred 3,000 demonstrators in 1988\u201d. Wemmer still fumes about the article, which he claims misrepresented the Smithsonian's involvement in this secretive southeast Asian nation. That the institution's project, in a wildlife park called Chatthin, headed by a Karen warden, was based 1,200 kilometres north of the site of the atrocities described in the piece didn't seem to matter, he complains: \u201cWe were guilty by association.\u201d The next day, Wemmer was summoned to Capitol Hill, to answer congressional staffers' questions about his involvement with the Burmese regime, then called the State Law and Order Restoration Council. They wanted to know why a federally funded institution was operating in a country against which the United States enforced sanctions. They eventually accepted Wemmer's arguments that his work was benign. But the biologist left the meeting knowing that he was on thin ice. \u201cWe were working in a highly charged political arena, and stood accused of hurting Myanmar's democratic movement,\u201d Wemmer says. Similar accusations still swirl around Wemmer and other Western conservation biologists who work in Myanmar. The researchers are convinced that their work is justified, given the country's rich yet threatened biodiversity \u2014 and the enthusiasm of local conservationists for partnerships with Western scientists. But critics worry that their presence helps to legitimize the military regime, and seems to prioritize the needs of wildlife above those of a brutally repressed population. \n               Innocents abroad? \n             When he first visited Myanmar in April 1988, Wemmer did not know what he was getting into. \u201cI didn't do a great deal of soul searching before going out there,\u201d he admits. His first impressions were simply of a very poor and isolated country. \u201cThat was about all I knew,\u201d says Wemmer. \u201cI think most field biologists are not particularly well informed about the countries in which they work.\u201d But four months later, Myanmar erupted into the headlines when a mass demonstration in the capital, Yangon (formerly Rangoon), ended with a massacre often called \u2018Burma's Tiananmen Square\u2019. Since then, Myanmar's military rulers, who now call themselves the State Peace and Development Council, have been heaped with opprobrium. They are at war with the Karens and other ethnic minorities, and rule the Burmese with a rod of iron. The London-based group Burma Campaign, which is pressing for democracy in the country, maintains that adults and children are routinely coerced into working on government projects; more than a million people have been relocated to make way for military installations, business ventures and the wildlife park highlighted in the  Observer  article. And according to Amnesty International, \u201ctorture has become an institution\u201d. Meanwhile, Nobel peace laureate Aung San Suu Kyi is under house arrest, 17 years after she was elected to lead the country. \n               Asset stripping \n             Wemmer and his colleagues agree the regime is unsavoury. But they reject the accusation of collusion in human-rights abuse. \u201cIf I thought what I was doing out there was aiding the regime in abusing the people, my conscience wouldn't allow me to stay. I would get the hell out,\u201d says Wemmer. \u201cBut by talking to a lot of poor people in the country and getting a really intimate understanding of how they feel, I came to the conclusion that what we are doing is basically a positive thing. Not being there wouldn't help the cause in any way.\u201d For conservationists, the main motivation is the opportunity to protect one of Asia's last wildernesses. \u201cMyanmar has the largest area of standing forest in the whole of the Asian-Pacific region,\u201d says Alan Rabinowitz, director of science and exploration for the Wildlife Conservation Society, based at the Bronx Zoo in New York, who has worked in the country for many years. The forests are a biodiversity hotspot and a stronghold for endangered tigers and Asian elephants. But maybe not for much longer: logging is rife, with much of the profits believed to go to Myanmar's military rulers. According to the London-based pressure group Global Witness, which works to highlight the links between the pillage of natural resources and abuses of human rights, Myanmar exported more than 1.72 million cubic metres of timber between 1999 and 2000. If this trend continues, the country will fast go the way of neighbouring Thailand, which has lost more than half of its forests over the past 30 years. For Jonathan Eames, who works for the Indochina arm of BirdLife International, the threat to Myanmar's biodiversity demands immediate action. \u201cIf we wait five or ten years in the hope that there's going to be a transition to a democratic, freer Myanmar, it will be too late,\u201d says Eames, who is now working on a US$1-million project to set up a reserve at Natmataung in the south of the country. But are biologists such as Eames, Rabinowitz and Wemmer letting their passion for conservation override concerns about legitimizing a brutal regime? To assess the situation, I travelled in May to Hukaung, in the northern state of Kachin, where the Wildlife Conservation Society is involved in a project to establish the world's largest tiger reserve, covering some 22,000 square kilometres. The park has around 100 tigers, and the potential to support ten times that number. \n               Under surveillance \n             Arriving in Myanmar, the first impression is of its friendly, hospitable people. But political reality soon creeps in. Soldiers scan your documents at regular checkpoints, while locals glance anxiously over their shoulders before starting a conversation. Propaganda posters express the \u201cPeople's Desire\u201d to crush troublemakers and oppose interfering foreigners. And in Tenai, an ugly mining town that hosts the Hukaung tiger reserve's headquarters, a man from military intelligence asked my guide daily questions about my movements. But in the park, there's little official interference, and few reminders that you're in a country reviled for its human-rights record. During my visit I accompanied three rangers on a trek into the jungle to set camera \u2018traps\u2019 used to count tigers. There are 20 rangers, mainly young men who spend 21 days each month in the field, unarmed and charged with protecting an area the size of Vermont against poachers, illegal gold miners and potentially hostile nomadic hunters. Part of their job is to teach local people about the benefits of conservation and discourage them from hunting. It is tough work. On our way to the field sites, we were plagued by leeches, slashed by razor-sharp, face-high grasses, and had to force our way through bamboo thickets so dense that we could barely swing our bush knives. Convincing the impoverished people of this region that it is better to conserve tigers than to hunt them for the lucrative Chinese medicine market is very difficult. It is clear that the park rangers, and Burmese conservationists, appreciate the presence of Western biologists. Myanmar needs foreign expertise, money and equipment, says U Gar, a retired forestry official who helped set up the Biodiversity and Nature Conservation Association, the country's first environmental group. \u201cWe can't wait, because our natural resources are depleting at an alarming rate,\u201d he argues. \u201cDoing something is better than doing nothing.\u201d Western involvement may also help keep the authorities honest, when it comes to conservation. Too often, protected reserves are merely \u2018paper parks\u2019. One of the most egregious examples is the Pedaung Wildlife Reserve, a small park near Myitkyina, the capital of Kachin, which I passed through on my way to Hukaung. It is Myanmar's oldest reserve, but arguably the most degraded. The warden, Khin Maung Hla, told me that since the park was established in 1918 it has suffered nearly 40% deforestation in its lowlands. The rhino, elephants and tigers that once roamed the forests are long gone. Even after the government gave Pedaung a new charter for wildlife protection in 1992, the degradation accelerated: three army compounds, a railway and a computing college have been built in the park. Efforts at reforestation by the warden and local people consist of plantations of mangoes, lychees and other fruit trees. Far from restoring the area's natural biodiversity, these are monocultures planted to feed soldiers and make money. \n               Uneasy alliance \n             Rabinowitz vows that this won't be repeated at the Hukaung tiger reserve. \u201cBut it is a huge challenge,\u201d he says. I counted seven government-backed gold mines on a map of the park; no one knows how many illegal miners are in the area, eroding riverbanks and polluting the water with mercury. But the illicit miners, mostly migrants from China, aren't making huge profits. So Rabinowitz is confident that \u2014 with the Wildlife Conservation Society's continued involvement \u2014 they will eventually be moved on, allowing the park to concentrate on protecting tigers and other wildlife. There is plenty to protect: during my trek we saw tracks of wild Asian elephants, the endangered fishing cat and a variety of endemic deer. I even learned of a recent unconfirmed sighting of the critically endangered pink-headed duck \u2014 on a hunter's skewer. The Hukaung reserve also represents an uneasy collaboration between the Burmese government and one of its ethnic opponents, the Kachin Independence Army (KIA). As part of a ceasefire deal, 80% of the park is under KIA control. Rabinowitz has found it uncomfortable wrestling with Myanmar's ethnic tensions, but he is happy with the end result. \u201cI have been playing the middle man, which is incredibly difficult,\u201d he says. \u201cI'm being manipulated by both sides, but unless it's to do some evil I don't care because I am manipulating them into saving tigers.\u201d Rabinowitz also argues that Myanmar's record on human rights may not be as despicable as is generally believed \u2014 at least when judged against the standards of other countries in the region. \u201cThe displaced people from Burma are a very intelligent, educated group who have maintained a hugely strong lobby,\u201d he says. \u201cI'm not arrogant enough to say I have seen everything there is to see. But having worked in the country for ten years, travelling to the most remote areas, I think it's been blown out of proportion.\u201d Eames also questions whether the abuses in Myanmar are of a fundamentally different magnitude to those in neighbouring countries, asking: \u201cWhere do you draw the line?\u201d Do you stop working in countries such as China, which has countless political prisoners and has annexed Tibet? What about Indonesia, where militias linked to the government slaughtered one fifth of the population of East Timor before it eventually gained independence in 2002? Even tourist-friendly Thailand last year cracked down on Muslim dissidents, Eames notes. Activists agree that human rights are being trampled across much of Asia, but argue that Myanmar gives cause for concern. \u201cIt is a military dictatorship where human rights are severely denied,\u201d says Sarah Green of Amnesty International, pointing to the country's 1,400 political prisoners. Another issue, highlighted by Human Rights Watch, is the recruitment of child soldiers \u2014 some 70,000 members of the Burmese army are believed to be less than 16 years old. And according to the International Labour Organization, forced labour is widespread. The authorities claim this is part of Buddhist tradition in which people donate their labour for the good of the community. But it's difficult to reconcile a practice traditionally associated with the maintenance of temples with the use of \u2018volunteer\u2019 labour to build military barracks, or to clear minefields with scant regard for safety. Wemmer admits to being troubled by the issue of forced labour, but says that it is hard to pin down exactly what's going on. \u201cYou see people working on the roads and highways, mainly women and kids, but there's no chain gang,\u201d he says. My experience was similar: there were no obvious signs of oppression and the main struggle, affecting civilians and soldiers alike, seemed to be with rural poverty. Eames takes a pragmatic view. \u201cI have issues with any country that has political prisoners,\u201d he says. \u201cI would prefer it if Myanmar were a liberal democracy, but it isn't.\u201d \n               Game plan \n             John Jackson, director of the Burma Campaign, doesn't condemn Westerners for working in the country, \u201cprovided you can go in and do the work you feel is necessary without buttressing the regime\u201d. The problem is that it's impossible to work on conservation projects in Myanmar without engaging on some level with senior officials. Top-down micromanagement is so pervasive that it's difficult to get anything done without ministers or generals being involved. And then there is the uncomfortable question of whether the regime is courting Western conservationists to gain international credibility. \u201cI don't think they would do anything without there being a game plan,\u201d says Jackson. This means that conservation biologists working in the country can expect to face continued scrutiny from suspicious politicians. \u201cOne has to use a certain amount of charm and guile to persuade these people that what we are doing is not against US interests or aiding and abetting the government of Myanmar,\u201d says Wemmer. When working in an undemocratic country like Myanmar, Wemmer adds, it's important to keep questioning your motives. But in the end, he takes his lead from his Burmese collaborators: \u201cWhen local conservationists ask for our international support, I don't think it's reasonable to say \u2018No, we're not going to help you because we don't support your government\u2019.\u201d \n                     Biodiversity: A tragedy with many players \n                   \n                     Charm offensive \n                   \n                     Nature  biodiversity insight \n                   \n                     Hukaung tiger reserve \n                   \n                     Burma Campaign \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

It also risks plunging the planet's climate into chaos. Peter Aldhous reports. China is booming, and its hunger for energy is insatiable. For its people, the dismal air quality across much of the country is a constant reminder of its reliance on coal and other dirty fuels. When  Nature  visited Beijing to meet the technocrats responsible for China's energy policy, the city was blanketed in acrid smog. After just a few days of stagnant weather, visibility in some districts had dropped to tens of metres. Flights were delayed and the Beijing Environmental Protection Agency advised people to stay indoors. You could almost taste the sulphur in the air. Energy and its consequences for health and the environment are high on the Chinese political agenda. But the hard-headed approach of the country's leaders should give us all pause for thought. China's energy policy will continue to be based around coal, they say, so the question of whether this notoriously filthy fuel can ever be made \u2018clean\u2019 is central to the country's development \u2014 and to the long-term stability of the global climate. The most immediate problem for China is that its economic growth is already outstripping its energy supplies. In boomtowns from Shenzhen to Chengdu, electricity is now an unstable commodity. Last year, 24 of China's 31 provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions admitted that they lacked sufficient power. In the summer, when drought curtails hydropower and air conditioners surge into life, blackouts have become commonplace. The nation's coal mines are straining to meet the demand, at a terrible human cost. According to conservative official estimates, more than 6,000 workers were killed in China's mines last year \u2014 making them the world's most dangerous \u2014 and the death rate was undiminished in the first half of 2005. Most coal-related fatalities never make the headlines, however. Many Chinese cities fail to meet international \u2014 or even their own \u2014 standards for air quality, causing hundreds of thousands of premature deaths each year. China's increasing use of coal is also sending CO 2  emissions skyrocketing, threatening a global climate disaster. \u201cWe understand that coal means not only energy, but also social and environmental impacts in the long term,\u201d says Zhou Dadi, director-general of the Energy Research Institute in Beijing and a leading adviser on energy strategy to China's leaders. While Dadi and other senior energy planners recognize these problems, their enthusiasm for coal remains strong. The country's leaders are determined that its economy will quadruple in size by 2020, which will require at least a doubling of the energy supply. Coal will bear most of the burden. \u201cWe have to increase coal consumption,\u201d says Guo Yuan, an energy systems analyst at Dadi's institute. \u201cIt's not a good picture, but we have to do it.\u201d Electricity generation is by far the biggest consumer of energy, although the demands of the transport sector are growing fast. Between 75% and 80% of China's electricity is generated by burning coal. Another 20% comes from large-scale hydropower projects, with most of the rest coming from nuclear stations. As yet, oil, natural gas and renewables such as wind barely feature in the electricity mix. But by 2020, according to official projections, gas-fired stations could be meeting 15% of China's electricity needs, while nuclear power may have expanded to around 5%. And thanks to a law passed in February this year designed to promote renewable energy, wind and other renewables could account for 10%. However, with power demands poised to double over the same period, it's clear that a massive increase in coal consumption is unavoidable. Sustaining economic growth is the leadership's priority, say seasoned China watchers, but it wants to achieve this without compromising energy security. China lacks substantial reserves of oil and natural gas, and is determined not to become heavily dependent on imports. But the country has coal in abundance. So it will use the fuel in ever-larger quantities, mainly to avoid a reliance on Russian oil and gas that could eventually bring the two powers to the brink of war. But can China meet its energy needs without poisoning its environment and filling the lungs of millions of people with particulates and oxides of sulphur and nitrogen? The effects of acid rain are spreading, and there are suggestions that soot is already disrupting the regional climate (see  \u2018Brown clouds cast a dark shadow\u2019 ).

Amanda Haag joins a few research novices who gave up their holidays for science. It is a cold, overcast May morning on a tiny island in the Gulf of Maine. Bill Clark and Karen Abbey are scrambling across algae-coated rocks, choosing their steps carefully to avoid seabird nests and poison ivy. One wrong move could send a protective gull parent into alarm mode, leaving the pair being screeched at, pooped on or, worse still, dive bombed. Clark and Abbey have put themselves in this precarious position to measure eggs and to place chicken-wire cages over empty nests ready to catch a gull when it returns. When they secure a bird, it's over to Julie Ellis, an ecologist from Cornell University, Ithaca, New York, who coaxes the gull into a bag. With the gull tucked safely inside, the team takes blood samples and wing measurements, and fixes numbered identification tags to one of its legs. I ask Clark if he has been dive-bombed yet this week. \u201cI haven't been hit, other than this splotch here,\u201d he says, motioning to the smattering of well-placed gull dung on his back. \u201cThis is the adventure component of the trapping,\u201d quips Ellis. It might be an adventure, but for Clark this isn't his usual occupation \u2014 remarkably, he has volunteered his time and money to be here. Clark, 66, of Kresgeville, Pennsylvania, and Abbey, 39, of Harpswell, Maine, signed up to help Ellis with her research through a non-profit organization called the Earthwatch Institute in Maynard, Massachusetts. Clark is a retired school teacher, and the gull project is his second Earthwatch expedition. This makes him typical of most Earthwatch recruits, a third of whom are repeat volunteers. Abbey is also a high-school maths and science teacher and like many first-time volunteers has never done research before. She is using her trip as part of a programme to bring science to her students. \n               Public service \n             Earthwatch was founded by educators and scientists in Boston in 1971 as an alternative way to fund field-based scientific research. Since then, it has grown into an international organization that each year sponsors research to the tune of some $4 million, supporting more than 140 projects across 47 countries. It is a pioneer of what is now called \u2018citizen science\u2019 \u2014 when scientists involve members of the public in collecting their data. Every year, around 4,200 people from 80 countries volunteer for Earthwatch projects \u2014 and the scheme has helped to generate thousands of peer-reviewed publications over the years. A similar organization called Biosphere Expeditions, based in Britain, started up in 1999, and smaller programmes can be found at some individual institutions, such as the University of California, Davis. For researchers, citizen science is a way to promote public outreach while getting help with labour-intensive data collection. For the volunteers, each expedition, lasting one to three weeks, is an opportunity to contribute to meaningful research in interesting locations. Some volunteers attend the same expedition multiple times: the current record-holder has notched up 20 trips to South Dakota to excavate the remains of mammoths. Clark is already planning his next Earthwatch expedition, this time with his wife, to Peru to look at the effects of ecotourism on macaws. Ordinary holidays have only limited appeal, he explains: \u201cThe beach holds no attraction for me. I like to be with people who are thinking and learning.\u201d The research that Clark and Abbey are helping with, at the Shoals Marine Laboratory on Appledore Island, involves studying the impact of gull populations on coastal ecosystems. The number of gulls in New England fell dramatically during the 1800s because their showy plumage was popular for adorning womens' hats and gowns, and seabird nesting colonies were raided for eggs. But since all seabird species became protected in the 1900s, gull numbers have risen to such an extent that they now have the potential to significantly change their surrounding ecosystem. \n               Watch and learn \n             For Abbey, the expedition is a way of bringing maths and science to life for her students. She has designed a website with a daily journal that her students can access while she is on the island. She also got her statistics class to draw up a model of gull population growth, and she says that she hopes to do more fieldwork with her students in the future. Earthwatch projects cover a wide range of interests and locations. A quarter of them fall into the social sciences, including ethnobotany, archaeology and public health. The rest incorporate some aspect of conservation, sustainable development or environmental monitoring; but all involve basic research and education. Projects run the gamut, from counting butterflies in Vietnam to measuring methane from termite mounds in Namibia. Because Earthwatch sponsors expeditions all over the planet, the uninitiated might be inclined to think of the trips as holidays. But the expedition briefings do not mince words about what will be expected of participants, who may have to pay between $500 and $3,500, depending on the location and the length of stay. The web page for the Maine gull project carries a clear warning: \u201cVolunteers should be stout of heart for deflecting gull attacks and moderately agile for clambering over slippery, algae-covered boulders.\u201d Blue Magruder, director of public affairs for Earthwatch, says that the organization is careful to encourage the \u2018right\u2019 volunteers \u2014 while deterring about half the people who make enquiries. \u201cThat's good \u2014 that's what you want to do,\u201d says Magruder. \u201cBecause it's no fun if somebody gets there and they're bored after three days.\u201d Expedition scientists and volunteers agree that the trips don't qualify as ecotourism, adventure tourism \u2014 or any other kind of tourism. \u201cYou don't look at it as a vacation because you're going there to support the research,\u201d says Clark. \u201cAny vacation you get is very incidental.\u201d Some volunteers say that if they wanted to tour an area, they wouldn't choose an Earthwatch trip. Magruder recalls greeting one volunteer on his return: \u201cI said, \u2018How was Ireland?\u2019 and he said, \u2018Well, my two-metre square was fascinating\u2019.\u201d Projects that are good candidates for citizen science usually involve labour-intensive or quantitative tasks, such as counting numbers of nests or logging data on zebra behaviour. In addition, the tasks must be fairly easy to learn. As a result, most expeditions tend to be field-oriented: working behind the bench in a molecular-biology lab wouldn't lend itself to recruiting many volunteers, or to data that can be collected reliably with little training. Some expeditions, such as Rolf Peterson's moose and wolves project in Isle Royale, Michigan, are more physically demanding than they are scientifically intense. \u201cThe main thing is to get all those bones back,\u201d says Peterson, an ecologist at Michigan Technological University, who leads expeditions to collect the remains of moose killed by the wolves that share the island. Peterson's research involves backpacking for 16 kilometres a day through the backcountry with 2\u20134 kilograms of moose bones strapped to the volunteers' backpacks, on top of a week's worth of food and equipment. \n               Skilful display \n             Scientists from different projects agree that volunteers often bring with them unexpected skills. On this trip, Abbey, who has a background in computer programming, designed a database entry-form for Ellis to help her extract data and analyse them more easily. Ellis notes that as a lead scientist you have to be flexible in using the volunteers' skills. Last summer, she had one couple who were 75 and 88 years old on her team. \u201cI was a little nervous about it,\u201d recalls Ellis. Rock climbing was clearly out of the question, but the woman was a retired mathematician and helped to devise new ways to organize Ellis's data, and the man, a retired zoologist, was a keen observer of gull behaviour. Whatever the task, the scientists give careful consideration to quality control. Ellis remembers one volunteer whose data on gull behaviour she later threw out because \u201cthe minute I turned around, he got on his cell phone\u201d. Eric Brown, a marine ecologist with the National Park Service in Kalaupapa, Hawaii, who has led Earthwatch expeditions to coral reefs, has compared the data collected by his staff with those from volunteers. His team was trying to determine the percentage decline of fish species between pristine and disturbed reefs. Brown found that, although volunteers identified fewer fish than professional staff, the percentage decline the volunteers recorded was comparable to that noted by staff. But Brown's study did illustrate the need to consider which tasks are amenable to volunteers and which require a professionally trained eye. Earthwatch designed its own project to evaluate the contribution of volunteers, and found that although volunteers made some recording errors during fieldwork, similar errors were made by experienced scientists (J. Foster-Smith and S. M. Evans  Biol. Conserv.   113 , 199\u2013213; 2003). Marie Studer, chief science officer for Earthwatch, says that the organization puts a tremendous amount of energy into helping scientists find constructive ways to integrate volunteers in their research. \u201cWe don't just accept or reject proposals,\u201d says Studer. \u201cWe see a good proposal that has value and potential, and we work very hard with the scientists to make it an Earthwatch project.\u201d The proposal process is much like any other funding request \u2014 it involves peer-review, and on average takes about a year, says Studer. The scientists say that although most volunteers leave the excursions ready to return to their day jobs, \u2018conversions\u2019 do take place in the field (see  \u2018Underwater odyssey\u2019 ). Andrew Russell, a glaciologist from the University of Newcastle Upon Tyne, UK, has led 25 Earthwatch expeditions to study glaciers in Iceland and Alaska, and knows of three volunteers who chose to pursue doctoral studies in Earth sciences. One volunteer who was on an Iceland expedition in 2002 is beginning his PhD work with Russell this autumn. \n                     www.earthwatch.org \n                   \n                     www.earthwatch.org/expeditions/shulman.html \n                   \n                     www.biosphere-expeditions.org \n                   \n                     extension.ucdavis.edu/urep \n                   \n                     Karen Abbey's web page \n                   \n                     Karen Abbey's daily blog \n                   \n                     General list of projects \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

He tells Tony Reichhardt why he wants to stress the \u2018science\u2019 in the social sciences. For some in the hard sciences, it was difficult to fathom: a sociologist winning the US National Science Foundation's A. T. Waterman award for achievement by a young researcher? Surely there must be some mistake. But in his acceptance speech last month, Dalton Conley was far from defensive about his discipline's status. \u201cI would like to argue that sociology is among the hardest sciences of all \u2014 harder than the proverbial rocket science,\u201d he told a black-tie gathering in Washington DC. Controlled experiments are out, Conley reminded the assembled scientific leaders, and causality is often masked by a confusing tangle of variables. And as if that wasn't difficult enough, sociologists' subject matter includes \u201cthe most politically charged and most personally sensitive topics one could address\u201d. Some researchers respond to the challenges by retreating into largely descriptive approaches, but Conley has won respect for applying rigorous, quantitative methods. He is the first sociologist to win the prestigious Waterman prize, worth a handsome $500,000. Weeks after the award ceremony, in the Washington Square office where he directs New York University's Center for Advanced Social Science Research, Conley says he hasn't decided what to do with the prize money. But relaxing in a room comfortably cluttered with books \u2014 including the four he's already written by the tender age of 35 \u2014 he is happy to elaborate on the message of his speech. \u201cA lot of the most interesting social science tries to push beyond descriptive accounts of how the world looks and get into causal accounts of how it works,\u201d Conley explains. But lacking the ability to manipulate variables the way a physicist or chemist would, \u201cyou have to look for tricks, natural experiments\u201d. When it comes to finding clever new ways to mine sociological data, Conley admits to being competitive. \u201cI like to squeeze a little bit more out of the lemon after everyone else has squeezed it,\u201d he says. One database he's squeezed particularly hard is the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID), a longitudinal study of nearly 8,000 US families. The PSID, administered by the University of Michigan, has been following the same families and individuals since 1968, the year before Conley was born, collecting a wide range of data on their economic status, health, work and family life. The research problems that interest Conley most have to do with accidents of birth such as skin colour and body size, and how they can affect not just one person, but a whole family tree. His research has advanced our understanding of race and class. And given Conley's own early upbringing on a low-income housing project, he can claim more street credibility than most of his academic colleagues. But what really separates Conley from his peers is his sophistication in analysing multiple variables to tease out underlying, and sometimes unexpected, patterns. He has used the PSID to ask who gets ahead and who doesn't in America, and he is especially good at weeding out factors that distract from the real story, such as current annual income. Net worth, he has found, is a much better measure of the resources available to a person, since it captures wealth handed down from earlier generations. As Conley reported in his 1999 book  Being Black, Living in the Red: Race, Wealth, and Social Policy in America , this accumulated wealth is crucial in determining future economic success. \n               In black and white \n             Conley's diligent number-crunching has also provided new insights into the real differences \u2014 or lack thereof \u2014 between races. While studies have consistently shown that African Americans are more likely to drop out of high school and college, most have ignored the fact that a typical white family has eight times the accumulated wealth of its black counterpart. When Conley applied statistical techniques to remove the variable of family wealth, the most recent cohort of African-Americans in the PSID was actually more likely to graduate from high school than were whites. In an economy where wealth begets wealth, this could be significant for social policy. Indeed, Conley's data lead him to suggest that affirmative action should be based on economic class instead of race. He hasn't come out in favour of paying reparations to the descendants of slaves to right the economic wrongs still being visited upon them \u2014 as divisive a topic as one can imagine in American politics \u2014 but he doesn't dismiss the argument out of hand. Even if society won't make such payments, he notes, doing the numbers is still worthwhile to point out the real costs of unequal opportunity. Conley's own background provided an education in race, class and the dickensian twists and turns that a life can take. Born to middle-class white parents, he grew up \u2014 in part due to his parents' bohemian preferences \u2014 in a low-income neighbourhood where nearly everyone else was black or Latino. It was a rough environment, in which a playground quarrel could end with a knife being pulled. When he was 13, a black friend was paralysed by a ricocheting bullet, a traumatic experience that left Conley with an obsessive-compulsive disorder that lasted into adulthood. \n               Divided lives \n             Even as a child, however, Conley was aware that he enjoyed privileges that his playmates didn't share. His parents were able to navigate their children through New York City's inequitable educational system \u2014 he went to a mostly white, upscale school in Greenwich Village a few blocks from his current office; his own two children attend the same school today. Rather than ending up in a gang like some of his friends, Conley was a semi-finalist in the high-school Westinghouse Science Talent Search. Although he claims never to have made a conscious decision to investigate the factors that shaped his own life, and those of his childhood friends, today he says that it's obvious to him why he later gravitated towards the study of race and class. As an undergraduate at the University of California, Berkeley, Conley briefly considered a career in biomedical research, before deciding too much of the work he saw was \u201call trees and no forest\u201d. While conceding that sociology can sometimes suffer from the reverse problem, he has no regrets about his chosen field, which allows him to apply quantitative rigour to vexing social questions. Conley examined one such question \u2014 the consequences of birth order \u2014 in his 2004 book  The Pecking Order: Which Siblings Succeed and Why . It's not as simple as the firstborn always wins, he has found. In fact, using data from the PSID, the General Social Survey and the US Census, Conley concludes that birth order only really counts in families with more than two children \u2014 and that external societal and economic pressures play a larger role than expected. Poor people with larger families, he suggests, often are forced to make hard decisions about which children to invest their time and money in \u2014 decisions that wealthier parents can avoid. Lately, Conley has become interested in how body size affects economic fortunes. Using the PSID to include data on older women than other studies have considered, he finds that being overweight leads women to have less workplace prestige, whereas overweight men suffer no such problems. Overweight women also have lower family income, are less likely to get married, and are more likely to be divorced, separated or widowed. \n               Just add genetics \n             Conley has always been interested in how biological and social factors interrelate, and he sees big research opportunities in combining genetic and sociological data. Social scientists have been rightly sceptical of the easy explanations for human differences offered by some geneticists, says Conley. \u201cBut they're standing on the sidelines carping like little yappy dogs,\u201d he argues. \u201cWe need to dive headfirst into this.\u201d To Conley, genetic differences are just another variable to throw into the mix along with socioeconomic factors. While many sociologists prefer to think of their field as one of the humanities rather than a science, Conley seems happy either way. Narrative is central to his work, and his books blend quantitative arguments with personal stories. Having written a childhood memoir,  Honky , at 30, he says he may someday try his hand at a novel, and he alternates writing scientific papers with popular books and op-ed pieces. Sally Hillsman, executive officer of the American Sociological Association, calls Conley \u201cperhaps the most impressive sociology scholar of his generation\u201d, while comparing him to Carl Sagan and Stephen Jay Gould in his ability to communicate to a wider audience. But even with Conley's gift for mixing storytelling and statistics, sociology can never fully account for all of the variables that shape an individual's life. As he wrote in  The Pecking Order : \u201cAnyone who tells you that they are going to explain your personality, your marriage, your career, or anything else about you with one factor \u2014 gender, birth order, income, or astrological sign \u2014 might as well be selling you a bottle of snake oil.\u201d Conley is no snake-oil salesman, and in that book advocated a more nuanced approach to studying who succeeds, and why: \u201cAnd just maybe \u2014 along the way \u2014 we will have a little more sympathy for our less fortunate brothers and sisters.\u201d \n                     Opinion polling: Taking the voters' pulse \n                   \n                     Video violence: Playing with fire? \n                   \n                     The crystal ball of chaos \n                   \n                     Dalton Conley homepage and selected publications \n                   \n                     NYU Center for Advanced Social Science Research \n                   \n                     NSF Press Release on Waterman award \n                   \n                     American Sociological Association press release \n                   \n                     Panel Study of Income Dynamics \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},
{"file_id": "4351022a", "url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/4351022a", "year": 2005, "authors": [{"name": "Helen Pilcher"}], "parsed_as_year": "2006_or_before", "body": "It was cold and clammy, but it changed the rules of life for ever. Helen Pilcher goes in search of the ancestor of all animals. Some geneticists have all the luck. While most are slavishly chained to the bench pipetting liquid, Werner M\u00fcller from the University of Mainz, Germany, gets to ponder the origins of life as he dives for sponges in the Adriatic Sea. His favourite spot is a 30-metre-long cave off the coast of Croatia, where sponges at the grotto's entrance are bright yellow, a hue bequeathed to them by the bacteria they contain. Sunlight pours through a hole in the ceiling. \u201cIt's a beautiful place,\u201d he says. M\u00fcller hopes that his bounty will shed light on one life's biggest mysteries: how did animals come into being? Their birth is still shrouded by the mists of time, but scientists do know something special happened in the ocean around 600 million years ago when a group of single-celled creatures joined forces to form the first ever animal body, or \u2018metazoan\u2019. Clubbing together allowed the cells to share the labour of living and paved the way for the evolution of specialized cell types, such as muscle, nerve and stem cells. This ancestor of all animals, known as the urmetazoan, would have needed a genetic blueprint for its structure or body plan. And this plan was the raw material that evolution acted on to give us the dazzling variety of animals we see today (see key examples in Graphic, below). So it's no surprise that M\u00fcller and others want to find out more about this extinct animal. They want to discover how single cells took the pivotal step to make that first body, why animals evolved the way they did, and what it was about that early environment that kick-started animal life. But with the urmetazoan dead for more than half a billion years, studying it is something of a challenge. No fossils have been found, so there are no physical clues to its appearance. As a result, scientists are studying its closest living relatives: sea sponges and single-celled animals called choanoflagellates. By comparing these with each other \u2014 and with more complex animals such as mammals \u2014 they hope to build up a picture of the urmetazoan's genetic make-up and physical characteristics.  \n               Simple blobs \n             Researchers have long regarded sponges as the most primitive form of animal life. As such, they are likely to be the most similar to the urmetazoan. At first glance, sponges seem simple. They have no gut, no brain, no obvious front or back, left or right. Adults pump water through a system of canals and cavities to extract food. \u201cBut they're much more sophisticated than the amorphous blob you see in the bath tub,\u201d says M\u00fcller. For example, sponges are made of many different cell types. They have collar cells that beat their whip-like tails to create a water current inside the sponge's body, drawing food in and washing waste away. Stem cells give rise to sperm and egg, and epithelial \u2018skin\u2019 cells provide a protective barrier from the outside world 1 , 2 . Cellular variety like this is the essence of multicellular life. And, just like in sponges, specialized or \u2018differentiated\u2019 cells would have allowed the urmetazoan to feed and reproduce simultaneously, making it more efficient than its unicellular neighbours, who could do only one job at a time. Genetic comparisons between sponges and younger members of the animal tree provide more insight into how these cells all worked together. Sponges, for example, have proteins called integrins on the surfaces of their cells. These tether the cells in place by sticking to another protein called collagen, which surrounds the cells 3 . Such proteins are found in more complex metazoans, so it is likely that the urmetazoan used a similar cellular adhesive. But the cells also have to communicate. They have to organize themselves into a body with multiple cell types, so strategies are needed to tell the cells where and what they should be. Like more complex animals, sponges solve this problem by using specific molecules to guide differentiation and migration as the cells develop in their embryos. Bernard Degnan, a geneticist at the University of Queensland, Australia, is studying embryos of a sponge called  Reniera  to understand more about how body plans emerged in evolution.  Reniera  embryos contain at least 11 specialized cell types arranged in a particular pattern 4 . Pigmented cells, for example, are initially found on the embryo's surface, but then migrate to one end where they form a dark spot and then a ring. Degnan speculates that cell migration and differentiation in these embryos is controlled in part by soluble chemicals that diffuse along the embryo's body creating a concentration gradient, a system also used in higher animals. M\u00fcller has isolated one such chemical from another sponge,  Suberites domuncula 5 , and thinks that it may influence cell differentiation in both embryonic and adult sponges. There are signs that many other molecules associated with development in animals also occur in sponges. The Wnt family of proteins, for example, influences how cells become specialized and also helps to lay down the key spatial coordinates of the body plan in complex animals. Sponge cells make the Frizzled protein, a receptor that is activated by Wnt proteins 6 . And they also make a variety of metazoan-like transcription factors \u2014 proteins involved in controlling gene expression \u2014 that are key players in development 7 , 8 . The fact that these genes occur during development in all existing animal lineages hints that they were playing a regulatory role in the embryos of the first metazoan. \u201cThe urmetazoan was probably quite sophisticated in a developmental and genomic sense,\u201d says Degnan. This suggests that it already had the genetic toolkit to direct a body plan containing multiple cell types. To find out where this toolkit came from, biologists are looking even further back in time, at the single-celled ancestors of the urmetazoan. Their modern-day descendants are choanoflagellates, unicellular creatures that look uncannily like sponge collar cells. Surprisingly, choanoflagellates harbour many of the tools needed for multicellular living. Geneticist Nicole King from the University of California, Berkeley, has discovered that choanoflagellates express genes involved in cell adhesion and communication in animals 9 . \u201cThis tells us that the molecular machinery for multicellularity was on site before the transition to multicellularity took place,\u201d says King. \n               Parental traits \n             Like choanoflagellates, the urmetazoan's single-celled ancestors may have used signals relayed by proteins called tyrosine kinases to sense changes in the outside world. Cell adhesion might have helped unicellular organisms to form simple colonies \u2014 colonies that may have been an intermediate step between single cells and true multicellularity. The urmetazoan may then have recruited these genes for new purposes. \u201cEvolution is an extremely dynamic system and paradoxically a very lazy one,\u201d says palaeobiologist Simon Conway Morris at the University of Cambridge, UK, who studies the origins of metazoans. \u201cIt will co-opt whatever it can.\u201d But this raises a puzzling question. If the toolkit was already there, why didn't animals evolve sooner? The answer seems to be that the catalyst for multicellular animal life may not have been genetic but environmental \u2014 in the form of rising global oxygen levels (see  \u2018Animal magnetism\u2019 ). \n                     www.jgi.doe.gov/sequencing/why/CSP2005/reniera.html \n                   \n                     www.peabody.yale.edu/collections/iz/iz_genome.html \n                   \n                     www.genome.gov/12511858 \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Declan Butler weighs up the pros and cons of electronic alternatives to that dog-eared notebook. Pity the poor lab notebook. Almost everyone is publishing, sharing and searching information in electronic form, from biological and literature databases to blogs of their latest ideas. But lab notebooks are stuck in a time warp, still handwritten, on paper. Many scientists can barely understand their own scribblings from last week, let alone five years from now \u2014 as anyone who has had to decipher the hieroglyphics of a co-worker can testify. We've been promised the \u2018paperless lab\u2019 since the early 1990s, but it hasn't taken off. Now, almost every laboratory is struggling with an explosion of data, much of it generated by automated instruments. An electronic version of the lab notebook can fully integrate with all these digital data and images. But most researchers continue to make fuzzy printouts of gels and data tables, and glue them on to the leaves of their notebooks. Things may finally be changing, however. E-notebooks are ready for prime time, says Douglas Perry, a laboratory informatics expert at the Indiana University School of Informatics in Indianapolis. New products are being rolled out across the pharmaceutical industry by a growing army of vendors, he says, noting that the industry's massive investment in e-note-books has helped the technologies to mature. So far, academia has been slower to respond. But labs that have switched from paper say e-notebooks have made life easier, improved quality, and revolutionized the way they share data and results. At Sweden's Karolinska Institute, bench scientists at the Centre of Excellence in Structural Genomics quickly adapted to their new paperless lab. They are using an e-notebook made by Stockholm-based Contur Technology. \u201cIt's intuitive, and easy to get started,\u201d says Johan Weigelt, the centre's chief scientist. \u201cPeople got rid of their paper notebooks immediately.\u201d Weigelt says the e-notebook lets scientists share everything: \u201cthe bioinformatics, expression data, sequence analysis and all the molecular biology, protein purification, crystallization and structural determinations\u201d. P\u00e5l Stenmark, a Karolinska postdoc, says his co-workers find the e-notebook gives them easy access to each other's results. \u201cYou don't have to ask each other for protocols. You can read exactly what the other person did,\u201d he says. Knowing that others regularly dip into his e-notebook has also prompted Stenmark to spruce up his own note-taking. \u201cYou have to be a bit more particular when writing; that's good because it's easy to be sloppy when writing a personal lab book.\u201d And when you can't find that crucial protocol? \u201cIt's also very nice to be able to search your own lab book.\u201d Although the data entry \u2018pages\u2019 of an e-note-book look like a typical web form, they are dynamic not static. Once an experiment is set up, data is automatically captured and stored in a structured database, often alongside instrument settings. And where a compound, protein or gene is mentioned, it can be hyperlinked to structure and sequence data on the web. You can add notes as you go along, compute or analyse results directly in your notebook, and store those in turn. Once the experiment is over, click on the \u2018submit experiment\u2019 button, and the computer gives it an indelible date and timestamp, and you sign it off with an encrypted digital signature. The pages can now never be modified by anyone, although comments can be added later, each with their own timestamp and signature. It is this electronic security, and the need for detailed documentation to protect legal challenges to their inventions, that has driven drug companies to embrace e-notebooks. They also meet the US Food and Drug Administration's strict standards for record keeping for clinical trials and regulatory approvals, and may help discourage misconduct. But the biggest advantage of going electronic should appeal to both industry and academia alike. With paper records, vast amounts of data lie unused and effectively hidden, whereas e-notebooks allow results to be instantly shared with collaborators. The pitfalls of paper are estimated to cost the drug industry alone over $1 billion annually in lost opportunities and duplicated research. However, installing new software on scientists' computers, and simply telling them to use it, is not enough. Most software needs to be customized to the working habits and research needs of individual groups, which means an investment of time and energy. Experience shows that scientists won't adopt e-notebooks, if it means taking on additional computing tasks, unless it also makes their job markedly easier. Software has to adapt to the user, not the other way round. The Paris-based pharmaceutical giant Sanofi-Aventis spent years working with a French software provider, Klee Group, to develop a product (now available commercially as Kalabie) that met the specifications its scientists needed. \n               Cut to size \n             Customizing e-notebooks is proving more difficult in academia than in industry. Industry research groups are typically large and well-funded, with clearly defined project management and workflows, and generous IT support. \u201cAcademics simply don't have funds for software that needs customizing to their situation, and there are almost as many different situations as there are labs,\u201d says Robert Cannon, a computational neuroscientist at Edinburgh University and founder of the Edinburgh-based notebook company Axiope. And experimental protocols are continually changing. But redesigning the pages of e-note-books, and adding fields and tables, usually entails modifying the structure of the underlying database. That requires the skills of database engineers, a luxury few labs enjoy. Apart from a handful of big international collaborations that have database managers, such as CERN's Large Hadron Collider, most academic research is investigator-driven and small-scale. Academic groups are often scattered across disciplines, and are perhaps overly creative in inventing different ways of working. Academic e-notebooks need to include user-friendly tools allowing researchers to customize them without demanding computing skills, says Gwen Jacobs, who heads the open-source NeuroSys neuroscience e-notebook system at Montana State University, Bozeman. \u201cAny system must be flexible enough to handle any type of data, and any experimental protocol,\u201d she says. \u201cThe nice thing about NeuroSys is that researchers can customize their templates and build user interfaces without a database administrator,\u201d says Maryann Martone, scientific coordinator of the Mouse Biomedical Informatics Research Network, based in La Jolla, California. Martone is carrying out an \u201cexhaustive evaluation\u201d of commercial and open-source e-notebooks. Although most e-notebook vendors focus on the lucrative market in industry, Contur, Axiope and Rescentris in Columbus, Ohio, among others, are bringing out products targeting the needs of computer-illiterate academics. And if you are keen to try one for free, you can download a basic open source Electronic Laboratory Notebook ( http://collaboratory.emsl.pnl.gov ). It lacks the cutting-edge database features of commercial products, but allows any group to share notebooks online and create templates for data entry. It also has a suite of data-analysis tools. The system was built by a group led by Jim Myers, a pioneer in e-note-books at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory in Richland, Washington. Besides freeing academics from paper, electronic notebooks herald much deeper changes to the way science is practiced. Blogging has transformed communication on the web, and once scientists start making their e-notebooks available online \u2014 if only to remote collaborators \u2014 there will be a revolution in data sharing, predict observers. Rather than spending time collecting their own data, scientists will organize themselves around shared data sets, much as astronomers do, says Monica Schraefel, a computer scientist at the University of Southampton, UK. Her SmartTea e-notebook project aims not just to get paper out of chemist's labs, but to get their experiments out to external collaborators as soon as they're finished. \n               Track records \n             Schraefel's group is also helping the scientists who barely use paper at all: bioinformaticians. \u201cWhereas chemists have 400 years' practice using a lab book for their experiments, bioinformaticians, who do all their work on a computer, have none,\u201d she says. In bioinformatics research, software is used to analyse data from big biology databases such as GenBank and Swiss-Prot. The \u2018results\u2019 are often strewn across thousands of computer files that the researchers struggle to organize. \u201cThe strategies we've seen them invent to keep track of their work are amazing \u2014 and they fail,\u201d says Schraefel. \u201cIt gets to the point, they tell us, where it's easier to run an experiment again than to try to find the data. Great.\u201d And if bioinformaticians can't keep track of the mess on their own hard drives, what hope do they have of sharing results with colleagues? Schraefel is tackling this problem by building unobtrusive software dubbed MyTea, which runs in the background and tracks related files and notes. The idea, she says, is to create \u201crepresentations of work in progress that can be shared\u201d \u2014 in short, lab notebooks. Whatever form e-notebooks take, some are concerned about how robust archived copies will be. \u201cI'm very nervous about the fragility of digital information,\u201d says Martone. \u201cWe can still read papyri and stone monuments from over 2,000 years ago. We sometimes can't read digital files from 10 years ago.\u201d But Stenmark points to the \u201cdisastrous\u201d risk of losing a paper notebook, perhaps in the train on the way home from a lab party. He sleeps easier knowing his e-notebook is automatically backed up nightly to multiple locations. And those attached to their dog-eared lab books shouldn't worry: even the drug industry is reluctant to abandon paper completely. Although electronic digital signatures and time stamps are now legally accepted, they haven't yet been tested in a court case. So companies that have gone electronic are playing it safe. After each experiment is submitted to the e-notebook, managers print it out, have the researcher and a witness sign each page using a pen, and lock the lot in a safe. \n                     The web gets social \n                   \n                     Should software hold data hostage \n                   \n                     Bio-ontologies: fast and furious \n                   \n                     Incorporating the Internet \n                   \n                     The future of the electronic scientific literature \n                   \n                     Contur \n                   \n                     Kalabie \n                   \n                     Neurosys \n                   \n                     Rescentris \n                   \n                     The Smart Tea Project \n                   \n                     Web resources on e-notebooks \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},
{"file_id": "436014a", "url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/436014a", "year": 2005, "authors": [{"name": "Rex Dalton"}], "parsed_as_year": "2006_or_before", "body": "Thanks to the influence of a powerful US senator, more than $120 million has been pumped into research on Alaska's endangered Steller sea lions in just four years. Rex Dalton asks what we've learned. A hardy creature of Alaska's forbidding Aleutian Islands, the mighty Steller sea lion ( Eumetopias jubatus ) survives where few other mammals can. In freezing temperatures and battered by Arctic storms, bulls of the species can reach 1,000 kilograms. But a scientific initiative to determine why the Aleutian population of Stellers has plunged over the past three decades is making them a wilderness legend for another reason. For some biologists, the Steller has become a symbol of how not to conduct complex ecosystems research. \u201cThe dollars were directed toward dealing with a political conflict,\u201d claims Larry Crowder, a population ecologist at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina. Over the past four years, the US government has poured more than $120 million into Steller research \u2014 a sum described by one biologist working on the species as \u201cobscene\u201d. It dwarfs the funding for research on other endangered marine animals, several of which are much closer to extinction. Yet this highly politicized programme has so far failed to resolve a key question \u2014 whether fishing is responsible for the Steller's decline. Steller sea lions, named after the German naturalist Georg Steller, who described them in 1741, were abundant in the northern Pacific until the 1960s. But by 1990, numbers off western Alaska had dropped so dramatically that the Steller was declared a \u2018threatened\u2019 species under the US Endangered Species Act. In western Alaskan waters, this listing did nothing to halt the decline. So in 1997, federal officials upgraded the status of the population west of 144\u00b0 W to \u2018endangered\u2019. Today, the western population of Stellers stands at around 35,000 adults. But the cause of the precipitous decline remains a mystery \u2014 particularly when the separate Steller population along Alaska's southeast coast continued to thrive. Some biologists blame disease, pollution, predation by killer whales, entanglement in fishing gear, or a combination of these. Others suggest that the cause is depletion of the western Stellers' prey, either as a result of local climate change affecting fish populations or because of commercial fishing. Knowing why the population declined will help devise a plan to ensure its long-term survival, and the Steller Sea Lion Research Initiative, launched in 2001, is supposed to provide some answers. But the idea of running such a huge research programme wasn't dreamed up by conservation biologists. Rather, it was the product of congressional intervention in a battle between environmental groups and fishing interests. Environmentalists believe that the Stellers' decline is directly linked to commercial fishing \u2014 in particular trawling for walleye pollock ( Theragra chalcogramma ), a cod-like species whose roe is in high demand for sushi. In the late 1990s, environmentalists were getting a sympathetic hearing from the administration of President Bill Clinton, and were using the courts to try to get tighter controls on the fishing industry. In 1998, a coalition of environmental groups filed a legal complaint alleging that the US National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) had violated the Endangered Species Act by failing to adequately assess the impacts of fisheries on the Stellers. The ensuing court battle went through numerous twists and turns. But when the federal judge hearing the case blocked a trawling season in Alaskan waters in the summer of 2000, a powerful ally of the fishing industry stepped into the fray: Republican Senator Ted Stevens. Alaska may not have many voters, but in Stevens it has one of the most senior and influential members of Congress. Then chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Stevens could put his spin on almost any government funding. With the fishing barons enraged over the court actions, Stevens used his influence to the full. In the waning December days of the 2000 congressional session, he held up the spending bill for the entire US government for a week, until he got what he wanted. Behind closed doors, a deal was hashed out in which pollock fishing would continue, except in areas close to Steller rookeries and haul-outs. Meanwhile, the National Research Council (NRC) was asked to conduct an independent review of the evidence on the Stellers' decline. And the Steller Sea Lion Research Initiative, costing more than $40 million in the first year alone, was launched. \u201cIt was not a good way to create a research programme,\u201d says Andrew Rosenberg, now an ecologist at the University of New Hampshire in Durham, but formerly a government fisheries scientist involved in research on Stellers. Until 2001, the federal budget for Steller research hovered around $1 million a year. Suddenly, a huge amount of cash was thrown at Steller studies, with little prior planning. \u201cI thought we would be lucky if 10% of the money was well spent,\u201d says one government scientist, who asked not to be named. The funds, administered by the NMFS, also had to be spent quickly within particular budget years, which limited the scope for long-term ecological projects. Now scientists are taking stock of what has been achieved. Last autumn, at a four-day conference on sea-lion conservation and research in Anchorage, Alaska, experts heard many of the first presentations of projects from the Steller initiative. In the opening session, Tom Loughlin of the NFMS's National Marine Mammal Laboratory in Seattle, who formerly helped administer the initiative, asked provocatively: \u201cWhat does $120 million buy?\u201d \n               Value for money? \n             Views on that point were divided. Among researchers funded through the initiative, there was great enthusiasm for projects that had provided basic knowledge of a difficult animal to study in a dangerous environment. There were presentations on diet, metabolism and physiology; on possible pollutants and pathogens; on reproductive performance and juvenile health; and on how far Stellers roam from their rookeries and haul-outs \u2014 important information in determining the size of no-fish zones around these sites to ensure adequate food for the sea lions. \u201cThese are very complicated issues,\u201d says Douglas DeMaster, director of the Alaska Fisheries Science Center in Seattle, which oversees the Steller research initiative. \u201cThat makes for big expensive studies.\u201d But some scientists argue that important opportunities to understand the Stellers' population biology have been missed. \u201cThe studies mainly just allow us to understand Stellers better,\u201d says Crowder. \u201cA study just can't be about metabolic pathways of a certain fish food. You have to link the study to population dynamics.\u201d \u201cI am pretty sceptical about the research money being targeted efficiently on key issues,\u201d concludes Crowder, who served on the NRC panel that eventually reported in 2003, with the Steller research initiative already well down the tracks. That report 1 , which suggested that a combination of factors other than a diminished food supply was probably to blame for the Stellers' decline, was itself controversial. Some experts criticized the NRC panel for concentrating too much on the contested reasons for the Stellers' decline rather than advising on research and other measures that might be taken to ensure their survival. \u201cIt asked the wrong question\u201d, Rosenberg argues. \u201cThe council didn't jump into this the way it should have.\u201d But the panel did come up with one firm recommendation for research: the best way to test the impact of commercial fishing, it said, would be to establish areas open and closed to fishing and monitor the survival of sea lions in each. In the event, getting the fishing industry to agree to this proved politically impossible. \u201cWe wanted to do it, but no one wanted an area closed for fishing,\u201d says DeMaster. For environmentalists, this failure is indicative of the problem with the Steller research programme. They contend that the legislation was worded in such a way that money would be steered away from some of the most germane research \u2014 in particular, any projects that might implicate the fishing industry in the Stellers' decline. The legislation specified, for example, that the initiative should include projects looking at the roles of predators and climate change. \u201cThe money didn't come without strings,\u201d claims Janis Searles, an attorney in Portland, Oregon, who was formerly with Earthjustice, a non-profit public interest law firm based in Oakland, California. \u201cFrom the US citizenry's perspective, having Congress direct the spending wasn't the smartest idea.\u201d In the absence of any comparison between large areas open and closed for fishing, researchers have adopted other methods of investigating whether the Stellers are nutritionally stressed \u2014 and if so, why. The main bone of contention surrounds the role of pollock in the sea lions' diet, and an idea called the \u2018junk-food hypothesis\u2019. This argues that Stellers prefer to eat oily fish such as herring and mackerel. But since the 1960s, the junk-food theory suggests, climate change has reduced the stocks of these fish in western Alaskan waters, causing them to be replaced by pollock, which is less nutritious 2 . Advocates of the junk-food hypothesis point to evidence that includes infrared imaging of Stellers preferentially feeding on herring at night in the wild 3 , and argue that pollock fishing is not the main reason for the animals' decline. The idea has been promoted most strongly by Andrew Trites, a biologist at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, Canada \u2014 whose relationship with the fishing industry has sparked controversy (see  \u2018Conflict of interest claims muddy the waters\u2019 ). At the Anchorage meeting, some researchers claimed that the junk-food hypothesis doesn't stand up. Reviewing the available data on fish stocks and sea-lion diets, Lowell Fritz, a biologist at the Alaska Fisheries Science Center, argued that evidence for the shift proposed by Trites and his supporters is weak or non-existent. \u201cIt also is often overlooked that cousins of Stellers are doing just fine eating pollock all over the world,\u201d Fritz adds. His analysis will soon be published in  Marine Mammal Science ; Trites is planning to publish his own review supporting the theory. While the debate rages on, one study presented at the Anchorage meeting did look squarely at the crucial relationship between fishing and Steller populations. Initiated before the congressional largesse and costing around $200,000, it formed the doctoral thesis of Daniel Hennen, then a graduate student at Montana State University in Bozeman. Hennen analysed population data for Stellers at 33 rookeries along the Aleutians from 1977 to 2001, relating the figures to regional fish-catch data for the same period. Before the animals were listed as threatened, he found that fishing seemed to be hurting the populations. After protection was in place, the populations studied started to bounce back. \u201cThe decline in the Steller population was fastest in geographical areas where there was the most fishing,\u201d says Daniel Goodman, Hennen's supervisor at Montana State. Hennen, now a postdoc at the Alaska SeaLife Center in Seward, adds that the strict enforcement of a ban on sea-lion shooting after 1990 may also have been significant, and that he plans to publish his results soon. Crowder calls Hennen's work \u201cthe most strategic and carefully done research\u201d on the relationship between fishing and the Steller population decline, noting an absence of similar studies in the published output of the Steller Sea Lion Research Initiative. \u201cWe are spending millions of dollars for grey literature that never has much influence,\u201d Crowder complains. \u201cAnd this is happening at a time when money for research on other endangered marine species \u2014 turtles, birds, otters and seals \u2014 isn't available.\u201d More Steller research money is set to flow. President George W. Bush's budget for next year includes a proposal for about $10 million, which could well be increased by Congress. A spokeswoman for Stevens says that the senator considers the programme valuable. Meanwhile, federal officials, scientists and stakeholders, including fishing industry representatives, are still arguing over a new Steller recovery plan, to replace a version that dates from 1992. And the political battles are destined to continue. In 2003, Stevens won another Congressional measure, designed to promote fishing in Alaskan waters. As a result, the state is now entertaining proposals to allow fishing in certain areas within 5.5 kilometres of the shore. \u201cSome of these proposed fishing areas are near critical federally protected Steller habitat,\u201d says Michael LeVine, an attorney for Earthjustice based in Juneau, Alaska. What does $120 million buy? Not, it seems, an end to the controversy surrounding this majestic marine mammal. \n                     Alaska Diary Part 3: Sea lion \n                   \n                     Sea lions massacred in Galapagos for sex organs \n                   \n                     NMFS Steller sea lion site \n                   \n                     NRC report \n                   \n                     Northern Pacific Universities Marine Mammal Research Consortium \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},
{"file_id": "4351156a", "url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/4351156a", "year": 2005, "authors": [{"name": "Trisha Gura"}], "parsed_as_year": "2006_or_before", "body": "Experts in neuroscience, computing and education are coming together in a massive effort to put the way in which children are taught on a sounder scientific footing. Trisha Gura profiles this ambitious \u2014 some might say foolhardy \u2014 initiative. In 1997, John Bruer, the president of the James S. McDonnell Foundation, launched a broadside against the fashion of taking findings from neuroscience and trying to apply them in the classroom. Experienced in both cognitive science and education, Bruer set out to demolish the hype surrounding what he saw as blatant pseudoscience. \u201cCurrently, we do not know enough about brain development and neural function to link that understanding directly, in any meaningful, defensible way, to instruction and educational practice,\u201d he wrote, arguing that so-called brain-based curricula had crossed \u201ca bridge too far\u201d 1 . Now, however, the US National Science Foundation (NSF) has decided that it's time to span the great divide between neuroscience and education. Over the next five years, it is giving more than US$90 million to four large, multidisciplinary teams incorporating cognitive neuroscientists, psychologists, computer scientists and educationalists. A further series of grants will be announced later this year. Rather than making the simplistic connections that so irked Bruer, these teams want to give the craft of teaching a solid scientific underpinning. They aim to devise practical teaching methods that will complement the brain's natural development, in part by integrating advances in cognitive neuroscience with cutting-edge information technology. \u201cThe science of learning is ripe for a breakthrough,\u201d claims Andrew Meltzoff, co-director of the Institute for Learning and Brain Sciences at the University of Washington in Seattle, which is leading one of the four NSF-funded teams. \u201cAnd the way it will occur is to build a bunch of \u2018mini bridges\u2019 from one discipline to another, instead of one big unsupportable bridge that goes all the way from neuroscience to education.\u201d \n               Treacherous territory \n             Maybe so, but Meltzoff and his colleagues are stepping into treacherous territory. Education is a highly politicized field, experts warn, littered with obstacles to reform and populated by powerful individuals with their own pet theories. \u201cEven with good ideas, getting them into the classroom requires you to jump over all these political hurdles, some of which you have no control over,\u201d cautions Pamela Clute, a specialist in mathematics education at the University of California at Riverside, who spends much of her time working with elementary and high-school teachers. Until now, science and educational research have not mixed well. Lacking common measurement standards, educationalists have touted theories that are more like philosophies, says David Klahr, a psychologist at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh and a member of another of the NSF-funded teams. \u201cIn education it's like: \u2018Here's my theory. I think kids can do this or can't do that,\u2019\u201d he complains. \u201cSo theory is very mushy.\u201d As a result, the field evolved into camps of specialists fighting to advance one theory of learning over another. Meanwhile, neuroscientists were holed up in their labs testing the ability of new imaging tools to deliver clues about which areas of the brain are involved in key aspects of learning. In another intellectual ghetto, computer scientists were busy using neural networks and fancy algorithms to model learning. Pity the poor teachers who were left trying to make sense of it all, barraged with brain-based pseudo-theories with no credible basis. The challenge was to get everyone working together. So two years ago, the NSF asked researchers to come up with proposals to address fundamental aspects of learning, each of sufficient size and scope to warrant a grant of more than US$20 million. Each proposal also had to reach directly into the classroom or another real-world setting. Now the first four teams to be selected are getting down to work. At Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire, neuroscientists are using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to visualize the activity of children's brains as they learn. A collaboration led by the University of Washington is investigating how the brain learns in a variety of settings. At Carnegie Mellon University, meanwhile, computer scientists and psychologists are leading a team that is refining computer-aided teaching tools. They are also setting up a \u2018LearnLab\u2019 in which teachers can get involved in the group's research. And a team headed by researchers at Boston University is creating textbooks and modules that focus on the mind and how it learns \u2014 with the goal of training teachers, as well as students. The Dartmouth team has the strongest neuroscience component. Team leader Michael Gazzaniga is using a technique called diffusion tensor imaging, which analyses MRI data to determine how efficiently different parts of the brain are wired together 2 . He is investigating differences between children who are fast or slow readers and, in unpublished work, has already found that connections between the two halves of the brain are much more direct in children who integrate visual information quickly \u2014 a skill that might correlate with better reading. \u201cWe are peeking under the hood at something that underlies this ability to read,\u201d Gazzaniga says. By working out the differences in brain organization that underpin children's reading abilities, he hopes it will eventually be possible to determine which teaching methods promote the formation of the most efficient neural connections. Also at Dartmouth, Daniel Ansari (pictured) is investigating numeracy. Ansari suspects that young children have two systems for doing mathematics. One system, called magnitude representation, is the crude ability to estimate quantity. Children younger than two years can usually distinguish between a large pile of candy and a small one, for instance. Ansari is testing toddlers with cards showing dots and pictures, to see if those who have trouble judging magnitude might be the ones who, later in life, will struggle with counting, addition and, ultimately, higher mathematics. The other system, called exact number representation, involves taking the idea of a large pile versus a small pile and coming up with numbers to stand for pile size. The ability to do this marks a huge leap in cognition, says Ansari, who is trying to visualize what this development looks like in the brain. Very young children won't lie still in MRI scanners, and so can only be studied using behavioural tests. But Ansari is running MRI scans on children aged seven to twelve, and hopes to distinguish how and when a child's exact number sense begins and whether early failures to develop the skill mark those who will subsequently struggle with mathematics. Once Ansari has figured out the brain regions involved in learning to count and estimate numbers, he can start devising exercises to facilitate the process that could one day be adopted in preschool. Older children who are having trouble with mathematics, meanwhile, might be given tests to see whether their problems lie with their sense of exact numbers, and potentially be set similar exercises to bring this basic skill up to scratch. \n               Adolescent emotions \n             After children have entered adolescence, emotions become a major influence on their ability to perform at school. This is being investigated by Abigail Baird, another member of the Dartmouth team. She is using MRI to watch what happens in the brain when a student hears a nasty comment or a gender slur and then proceeds to flub an exam. Outreach to teens who are struggling with their emotions is central to this work: Baird and her undergraduate assistant Jane Viner have created a 10-week mentoring programme that helps teenage girls cope with aggressive interactions. Girls who took part subsequently showed an increase in the activation of their prefrontal cortex \u2014 an area of the brain thought to help rein in our emotions \u2014 suggesting that they had indeed acquired some new cognitive strategies. In addition, the entire Dartmouth group is connecting its work with real-world education through a link with Steve Michlovitz, director of curriculum at the Windsor Central Supervisory Union, which oversees schools in Woodstock, Vermont. Formerly a school teacher, Michlovitz became interested in brain research while teaching a graduate course for education students at a local college, and more than a decade ago asked if he could bring his classes to Dartmouth to observe neuroscientists in action. Michlovitz now educates teachers about how the brain develops and functions, encouraging them to be more critical about reports on the latest findings and to avoid the sort of pseudoscience criticized by Bruer. Every two years he organizes an educational conference that brings together parents, teachers, administrators and cognitive scientists from Dartmouth and elsewhere. Outreach is also central to the plans of the Pittsburgh Science of Learning Center, based at Carnegie Mellon, where artificial intelligence researchers are building on their success in developing an automated \u2018cognitive tutor\u2019 for algebra. After dissecting the steps to learning algebra, a team led by Ken Koedinger devised algorithms that play the role of a tutor, doing set problems along with a student and offering hints. By scoring the student's answers, the cognitive tutor recognizes when to stop giving so many hints, and eventually withdraws completely \u2014 until the student makes a mistake or asks for help. Pupils who use the tutor learn algebra 50% faster than those taking regular classes, and also score 10\u201325% higher on standardized tests 3 . Today, the tool is being used at 1,800 schools across the United States. With the new NSF funding, Koedinger and his colleagues are teaming up with experts in other subject areas to build six more cognitive tutors in subjects including geometry, chemistry and foreign languages. They also want to have their tutors make smarter decisions about when to step back and let students try problems on their own. But the most ambitious part of the Pittsburgh project is the LearnLab, an experiment in outreach that allows teachers and students to work with the cognitive tutors, which will tailor themselves to complement the methods employed by each teacher. Teachers are also being encouraged to get involved with learning experiments, providing a framework to conduct a wide range of educational research projects without having to build relationships with each school from scratch. \u201cWhen a researcher has a great idea and they want to go do it in a school, they currently have to start out cold and get permission,\u201d Klahr says. Even with such outreach, implementing the findings of the NSF programme will be daunting. The hurdles include cost and entrenched curriculum standards. In California, for example, a recently passed law forces districts that adopt certain textbooks to teach from them \u2014 with no deviation \u2014 in order to receive federal dollars. \u201cThose who do education research need to go out in the real world and really see what it is going to take to implement their ideas,\u201d says Clute. And then there are the teachers. In order for innovation in teaching to catch on, they have to grasp the ideas involved. Clute points out that, in California, more than half of middle and high-school teachers have no undergraduate training in the subject they are teaching. So how can reformers ever expect to succeed? One NSF centre, based at Boston University, is tackling this problem. By creating textbooks and teaching modules that focus on learning and the mind, researchers hope not only to educate students about cognitive science, but also to open teachers' eyes to the potential of findings emerging from the NSF programme. \u201cPeople have a deep hunger to understand themselves better in such a complicated technologically driven world,\u201d says Stephen Grossberg, who heads the Boston centre. The final collaboration, between the University of Washington and Stanford University in California, is taking the science of learning out of the classroom. Meltzoff plans to team up with ethnographers \u2014 who study people in their own cultural contexts. They will visit families and hang out in playgrounds to discover how children learn outside school. He is particularly interested in the development of rational thinking, which can be studied by looking at whether children recognize that weighing up lists of pros and cons is a better way of making a decision than flipping a coin. By the age of eight, children usually say that coin-flipping is inferior, but will often revise their opinion if told a story in which flipping a coin led to a good result. Meltzoff suspects that conversations at home have a strong influence on the development of rational thinking, and will use the new NSF funding to put this idea to the test. \n               Explosion of findings \n             While individual projects such as Meltzoff's may seem arcane in their approach, he believes that the NSF programme in its totality could transform educational research. \u201cThere is a groundswell here about trying to understand the science of learning, bringing together practice and science,\u201d he says. \u201cWe are going to see an explosion of interdisciplinary findings that we have not had before in learning science.\u201d Bruer, once the arch-sceptic, agrees that real collaboration across the various disciplines represented in the NSF initiative could lead to advances. He even chairs the group that oversees the University of Washington team. But he still cautions against over-enthusiasm, especially given the seductive power of new brain-imaging technologies. \u201cYou never can tell where research is going to lead,\u201d he says. \u201cBut the danger to everyone, the NSF in particular, is expecting too much, too soon.\u201d \n                     Science education: Hothouse High \n                   \n                     Science education: Doing it for the kids \n                   \n                     Science education: Spare me the lecture \n                   \n                     Put your lab in a different class \n                   \n                     NSF press release on Boston, Pittsburgh and Washington centres \n                   \n                     Dartmouth College press release \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

But the cells might find other clinical applications in the near future, says Catherine Zandonella. When patients with the paralysing illness amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) call Jennifer Brand to ask when stem-cell therapies will be available, she has a stock answer. Brand, who is director of patient services for the California-based ALS Association, says that stem-cell research is still in its infancy. It's just too soon to tell when it might move into clinical trials, she tells her callers. Indeed, most experts predict that many years of laboratory work will be needed before stem cells can be used reliably to replace damaged cells and tissues. But some enthusiasts argue that this timeline overlooks more immediate clinical opportunities. These researchers want to exploit stem cells' abilities to home in on sites of injury and to deliver biochemicals that protect other cells 1 . And, controversially, they hope to move quickly into the clinic. \u201cDisease targets thought to be far in the future are closer to our grasp,\u201d claims Evan Snyder, who works at the Burnham Institute in La Jolla, California. Stem cells have been widely touted as eventual cures for neurodegenerative diseases such as ALS and Parkinson's. The conventional wisdom is that they would be grown to produce the particular nerve cells that are lost in each disease, which would then be grafted into the nervous system to repair it. But researchers currently understand little about the signals that make stem cells differentiate into particular cell types, nor are they sure how to get grafted cells to integrate effectively into tissues and organs. Snyder agrees that cell replacement is an exciting future prospect. But apart from replacing lost cells, he notes that stem cells have other, more subtle roles that could be exploited therapeutically. Snyder has evidence that, in the nervous system, stem cells can act as \u2018chaperones\u2019 that nurse sick and injured neurons back to health. Neural stem cells secrete biochemicals that make the neurons function better, promote survival, decrease inflammation and encourage the growth of blood vessels. One of these factors is glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor, or GDNF \u2014 which seems to protect both the cells that secrete the neurotransmitter dopamine 2 , lost in Parkinson's disease, and the motor neurons that are destroyed in ALS (ref.  3 ). Snyder has shown that neural stem cells taken from mouse fetuses secrete GDNF and promote recovery in mouse models of Parkinson's disease 4 . More recently, his team has found that human neural stem cells, from lines originally derived from the brains of aborted fetuses, can migrate from one side of a mouse's brain to the other in response to distress signals issued by injured tissue 5 . The potential to exploit these twin effects therapeutically is clear, Snyder argues. \u201cYou are not trying to replace the lost cells,\u201d he says. \u201cInstead, you are trying to protect what is there.\u201d Other researchers are working along similar lines \u2014 but are tweaking their cells genetically to make them into better nursemaids. At the University of Wisconsin, Madison, Clive Svendsen's team has engineered fetal neural stem cells so that they pump out greater quantities of GDNF. When the researchers injected these cells into the spinal cords of rats suffering from an ALS-like disease, they survived well and continued to secrete GDNF (ref.  6 ). \n               Taking the chance \n             Svendsen plans to approach the US Food and Drug Administration within the next few months to discuss testing the cells in ALS patients. He believes that the ideal time to give the treatment will be shortly after diagnosis, when a patient begins to lose limb function but before paralysis sets in. \u201cYou have a window of about a year-and-a-half to get in and do something,\u201d Svendsen argues. Although he hasn't yet published firm evidence from animal experiments that shows his engineered cells are protecting motor neurons, Svendsen has few doubts about pressing ahead into the clinic with a novel experimental therapy \u2014 given the severity of the disease and the lack of any effective treatment. Similar risk\u2013benefit arguments apply for patients with inoperable brain tumours. Here, too, some researchers are thinking about using genetically engineered stem cells. \u201cThe advantage is that these cells can track down and migrate through the tumour,\u201d says Frederick Lang, a brain surgeon at the University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston. His team has taken cells from bone marrow known as mesenchymal stem cells and inserted a gene for interferon-\u03b2 \u2014 a protein that can kill tumour cells. When the researchers injected the cells into the carotid artery of mice suffering from brain cancer, the cells migrated to the tumour. Encouragingly, these animals lived significantly longer than those who received injections of normal cells 7 . \n               Heart of the matter \n             Lang's approach may offer hope for patients who have no other treatment options, but many stem-cell researchers are alarmed about trials for patients with heart disease that are already under way. Based on contested results from animal experiments 8 , clinicians in the United States and Europe are now injecting stem cells into patients' damaged hearts in the hope that they will help repair the damaged tissue. The problem is that nobody knows for sure whether these cells are differentiating into heart muscle cells, fusing with cells that are already there, or exerting a protective effect by secreting growth factors. It could be a combination of all three, says Emerson Perin, who is heading a study of bone-marrow stem cells injected directly into patients' diseased hearts at the Texas Heart Institute of St Luke's Episcopal Hospital in Houston. Given the limited understanding of how stem cells behave when injected into the body, some researchers argue that it is too soon to be entering the clinic. For instance, Roger Barker, a neurologist at the Centre for Brain Repair at the University of Cambridge, UK, worries that neural stem cells might give rise to neurons that could integrate incorrectly into the nervous system, causing adverse effects such as a heightened sensitivity to pain. If so, he fears that the resulting publicity could damage the entire field. \u201cA negative trial doesn't do any good,\u201d says Barker. Snyder agrees that caution is necessary, but he argues that early trials using stem cells as nursemaids to protect sick and dying tissues will do the field a service, by giving the regulators and institutional review boards that must approve clinical trials some experience of handling stem-cell protocols. This will blaze a trail for later trials with the loftier goal of replacing damaged tissues, Snyder claims. In any case, Snyder believes that the risks are relatively constrained for stem cells derived from fetal or adult tissues, provided they are used only in the places where they would normally be found. If cells aren't being put in alien tissues, he argues, they are likely to behave normally. \n               Growing pains \n             But embryonic stem cells, which can develop into any of the body's tissues, are another matter. In particular, they can form tumours called teratomas that contain all sorts of tissue types. \u201cYou don't want bone or teeth or hair growing inside the spinal cord,\u201d says Svendsen. \u201cIt just wouldn't look good for the stem-cell field.\u201d Nevertheless, some researchers are exploring the idea of using embryonic stem cells to exert nursemaid effects. They note that the cells could be engineered to include a \u2018suicide\u2019 gene that could be activated to kill them, if any problems arise. Robert Benezra of the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York and his colleagues are studying a genetic condition that normally causes female mice to lose their young before birth because of heart defects. When Benezra's team injected pregnant females with mouse embryonic stem cells, they gave birth to live young 9 . The stem cells didn't cross the placenta, but they secreted a heart-repairing substance called insulin-like growth factor 1, which seemed to protect the fetuses. Benezra has no plans to move ahead into clinical trials. But cells grown directly from embryonic stem cells could start being injected into patients with paralysing spinal injuries as early as next year. Hans Keirstead, a stem-cell researcher at the University of California, Irvine, has derived cells that seem to restore some mobility to rats with spinal injuries 10 . These cells make the myelin protein coat that serves as electrical insulation for neurons \u2014 although Keirstead suspects that other protective mechanisms are also involved. \u201cI believe that they are playing some mysterious \u2018nurse\u2019 role,\u201d he says. \u201cThey are doing a lot more than just producing myelin.\u201d Keirstead's plan to move rapidly into the clinic has already caused some alarm 11 . But with other trials of stem cells as nursemaids for sick and dying cells also in the works, patient advocates such as Brand may soon have to revise their message. With luck, these trials will bring fresh hopes for the sufferers of ALS and other debilitating conditions \u2014 and not scare stories about adverse reactions. \n                     Stem-cell niches: It's the ecology, stupid! \n                   \n                     Stem-cell research: After the gold rush \n                   \n                     Stem cells pump out healing molecules \n                   \n                     The heart of the matter \n                   \n                     news@nature.com In Focus \n                   \n                     NIH stem cell information \n                   \n                     ALS Association \n                   \n                     International Society for Stem Cell Research \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Alison Abbott watched an operation to release a man from his obsessive thoughts. \u201cWhat are you thinking about?\u201d Clamped to the operating table with his skull drilled through to expose a patch of brain, Herr Z. answers his psychiatrist anxiously: \u201cI'm still thinking about the bad impression I must have made on the former colleague I met in the supermarket.\u201d It is close to midday and his brain surgery \u2014 which began at 8 am and will continue until 5 pm \u2014 has only partially distracted Herr Z. from this incessant, hammering thought. Herr Z., now being operated on by Volker Sturm, a neurosurgeon at the University of Cologne, suffers from obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), which makes him unemployable. He rarely goes out, because he fears contamination from anything he touches. Twenty years of therapy have not helped. An experimental surgical technique called deep brain stimulation (DBS) is currently the only hope for people like Herr Z. Having proved its value in the treatment of advanced Parkinson's disease, neurosurgeons are now keen to try DBS to treat one of the world's biggest health burdens \u2014 psychiatric disorders. Controlled clinical trials are under way in several centres in Europe and the United States to see if it can help with OCD and major depression. \u201cThe early results are very encouraging,\u201d says Ali Rezai, a neurosurgeon at the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio. DBS involves the insertion of electrodes deep in the brain to hit a precise neuro-anatomical target that is believed to be central to the disease being treated. The electrodes are connected to a battery-driven stimulator that sends pulses of current to the target neurons and normalizes their activity. The stimulator is sewn into the belly or chest and can be switched on or off remotely through the skin. The use of the technique has exploded since 1993, when Alim-Louis Benabid from the Grenoble University Hospital in France reported results from more than 80 patients with Parkinson's disease 1 . Around 30,000 similar operations have now been carried out worldwide. The success rate is high, and gratifyingly visible: a pulse of current through a correctly placed electrode instantly stops the tremors and releases the frozen muscles characteristic of the disease. The most common targets in Parkinson's disease are the subthalamic nucleus and the globus pallidus, components of the brain's motor circuitry whose signals are known to be distorted in Parkinson's disease. \n               Deep targets \n             The motor circuit is one of several proposed neural pathways that circulate sensory information received from the outside world, by sight and touch for example, through the thalamus into the cortex, the \u2018thinking\u2019 part of the brain (see Graphic, below). Having \u2018decided\u2019 how best to respond, the cortex returns response signals through the thalamus: signals to move away from something, or to feel good or bad about something, are shunted on to appropriate subcortical parts of the brain that arrange for the commands to be executed. Surgeons wondered whether other, less well defined cortico-thalamic circuits could be targeted by DBS. The subcortical limbic system is especially interesting as it is associated with emotion and may be central to certain psychiatric conditions. Andres Lozano, a neurosurgeon at the University of Toronto who recently published results of the first trial of DBS in severe depression 2 , makes no bones about it. \u201cOur greatest opportunity is in the field of psychiatry.\u201d Surgeons are still not agreed about where best to strike with their electrodes. They realize that targeting one point will affect an entire circuit \u2014 and one modified circuit is likely to affect information flow through others. No one knows exactly how these various circuits, with their positive and negative feedback components, might weave through different anatomical structures. But there are some pointers. In people who have suffered very localized brain damage, often following a stroke, behaviour can change in a very precise way. Neurosurgeons have often taken a lead for DBS from such observations and created carefully controlled damage, or lesions, in these areas to treat psychiatric diseases, including OCD. Bart Nuttin, a neurosurgeon from the Catholic University of Leuven in Belgium, who pioneered DBS in OCD patients 3 , targets a small frontal part of the limbic system known as the internal capsule. Other pointers come from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and positron-emission tomography, which enable activity in different parts of the brain to be visualized. Lozano, for example, selected a limbic region known as Cg25 for stimulation after his collaborators found it to be particularly active in depressed patients. Meanwhile, back on the operating table, Sturm is closing in on his preferred target, a particular section of the outer shell of the nucleus accumbens, a peanut-sized structure directly below the internal capsule. \n               Tracing a path \n             It is now 12:45 pm. Herr Z. began the day having his shaved head firmly clamped, under light anaesthetic, into a plastic stereotactic crown. The crown is now enabling Sturm to guide a 0.8-mm bore along the path he has defined on a computer screen with submillimetre precision. The path must hit the target exactly, without passing through any blood vessels \u2014 a haemorrhage could cause brain damage. But getting it right is hard as no two brains are exactly alike and brain-imaging techniques have limitations. After the clamping, Sturm took two different brain images: a computer tomography scan and a structural MRI scan. Sitting at the screen for more than an hour with a physicist and a neuroanatomist, he merged the images, identified his target and traced out the best straight line to its centre. \u201cI couldn't do this without working closely with basic scientists,\u201d says Sturm, now slowly threading a test microelectrode through Herr Z.'s brain along the set trajectory. The microelectrode converts neuronal activity to sound. Each anatomical structure has its own characteristic song, so this provides Sturm with a second guide. The recording is being carried out by a team of neuropsychologists, who are also taking the opportunity for an experiment of their own \u2014 to identify what may be characteristic neuronal firings when OCD patients try to shift their thoughts. Sturm then inserts the true electrode. It is a hair-thin cylinder 6 mm long, with four 1-mm contacts spaced along it. Each contact can be individually manipulated from outside: its polarity, and the shape, frequency and voltage of the current, can be adjusted. If one contact doesn't have an effect, then the next, 1 mm away, may be in just the right position. An X-ray confirms that its position is spot-on. 1:30 pm. Time for the first test stimulations. Herr Z.'s psychiatrist, Michael Schormann, takes an envelope from his pocket and places it in Herr Z.'s hand. Envelopes upset Herr Z. \u2014 they might have been licked. His fingers grip the paper and he reports escalation to 10 on his personal anxiety scale. The test impulse does not reduce it. \u201cIt sometimes takes a while to get the effect, but it is psychologically important for patients to take an active part in the procedure,\u201d says Schormann. Relieved of the envelope, Herr Z's hand writhes above the sheet in a washing motion until Schormann wipes it clean with alcohol. Herr Z. is wheeled out for an fMRI scan which confirms that his brain activity changes appropriately when the electrode is stimulated. Then back for the final sewing up. The long day is over. His stimulator and battery will be put in the next day. Sturm is part of a small \u00e9lite group of neurosurgeons in Europe and the United States, including Nuttin, Lozano, Rezai and Benabid. Together, with their teams of basic scientists, they regularly meet to compare techniques and results in order to try to understand scientifically what they are doing. This isn't simply a question of which anatomical target might be best, and why. The aim is also to understand better what the stimulation itself is doing. The original idea was that it simply blocked abnormal electrical activity, mimicking the effect of a lesion. Indeed, high-frequency pulses do damp down circuits by blocking excitatory neurons. But low-frequency pulses have the same effect by stimulating the inhibitory neurons in these circuits. The group also wants to improve three-dimensional neuroanatomy to help make the positioning of electrodes more accurate and optimize their effects. The surgeons also want to avoid ethical conflicts. They have occasionally used DBS to treat individual patients with other psychiatric and neurological syndromes, including Tourette's syndrome, epilepsy, minimally conscious state and cluster headaches. And they are thinking about obesity and drug addiction. But they know they must move cautiously. The controlled OCD and depression trials should first be completed and analysed, says the neurosurgeons, to be absolutely sure that the therapy really works. They don't want to charge blindly on and risk failures and the attendant bad publicity. They also insist that progress in the field should be driven by psychiatrists rather than neurosurgeons, and closely controlled by ethics panels. Ethicists worry about issues such as truly informed consent. They also debate the concept of personality, and whether it can be changed by DBS. \u201cBut patients don't see their obsessions and compulsions as part of their personality,\u201d comments Schormann. \u201cThey see them as something imposed on them, that they yearn to be rid of.\u201d Patients who have been successfully operated on speak of regaining lives they had considered beyond hope. Monsieur F., one of Nuttin's OCD patients, was suicidal before DBS made his obsessive thinking and compulsive behaviour vanish within seconds. \u201cThose who worry about ethics know nothing about it,\u201d he says. Herr Z., fresh off the operating table, hopes for the same freedom. He is a radio ham, and has recently learnt new languages to communicate with the world. He'd like to test out his new skills on a holiday, unconcerned by foreign germs. \n                     Neuroscience: A new atlas of the brain \n                   \n                     Shocks switch brain on \n                   \n                     Brain implants show promise against obsessive disorder  \n                   \n                     Parkinson pioneers blaze trail of controversy \n                   \n                     Neuroscience: A new atlas of the brain  \n                   \n                     NIH National Institute for Neurological Disease and Stroke: DBS information \n                   \n                     University of Cologne \n                   \n                     Cleveland Clinic \n                   \n                     University of Leuven \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

But getting everyone on board is no easy task, says Naomi Lubick. Earth has no shortage of spies \u2014 mechanical ones, that is. A range of instruments, including satellites, tide gauges and weather stations, constantly track natural phenomena. But like human spies, these machines rarely speak to each other \u2014 hampering the efforts of scientists, politicians and planners to best manage the planet's natural systems. It took a horrifying natural disaster to put Earth observation in the public consciousness. Soon after the Indian Ocean tsunami killed nearly a quarter of a million people in December 2004, news reports revealed that some of the hydrophones, seismometers and other devices that could have provided a warning were in place \u2014 they just weren't linked together in real time to provide an effective alert. Now plans are afoot for a system to warn of future tsunamis in the Indian Ocean and, with little public fanfare, a much more ambitious scheme is taking shape. The Global Earth Observation System of Systems, or GEOSS, promises global, instantaneous hook-up of satellites, ground-based stations, and oceanographic and atmospheric instruments. Within a decade, if all goes according to plan, scientists from participating countries will share data on a variety of global phenomena \u2014 from sea-surface temperatures, through rainfall totals, to land-use patterns. GEOSS would link the more than 50 Earth-observing satellites with thousands of oceanographic buoys and terrestrial observing stations. Scientists could combine millions of data sets into one coherent picture, which planners could use to improve people's lives. Using data from anywhere in the world, researchers would be able to predict the long-term agricultural outlook for various regions, track wetlands that are threatened by development, or send alerts when standing water is plentiful enough for the breeding of bumper populations of malaria-bearing mosquitoes. But GEOSS faces many procedural stumbling blocks. It's not clear what kind of information should be shared or by whom. Money remains a major issue in a field where funding for long-term monitoring projects is often slashed. The United States has coughed up most of GEOSS' start-up costs so far \u2014 up to US$750,000 in two years. Now that the programme has moved its headquarters from the United States to Geneva, other governments are starting to contribute money and staff. \n               Good connections \n             Scientists and policy-makers had talked about something like GEOSS for decades, but plans only began to crystallize at the 2002 World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg and at the 2003 G8 summit in Evian, France. Now supporters are busy identifying data gaps, and hope to put new instruments in place to fill them within the next four years. By 2013, advocates hope to have a complete data-sharing system whose output could help people make better-informed decisions about their lives. One day, GEOSS products could help forest managers track erosion, climatologists follow dust storms, or even anglers find the best spot to cast their line. On some levels, scientists already share their observations of Earth. Researchers have long swapped information from remote sensing satellites such as the US Landsat series and the European Space Agency's ERS satellites. GEOSS is a natural extension of this. Most scientists agree that the billions of dollars that already flow into Earth observing are not always spent most effectively. Data sets overlap dramatically for some observations, such as meteorological satellite recordings, but are sorely lacking in others, such as hydrophone measurements that could warn of tsunamis. And earlier international efforts to coordinate observations, such as the Global Ocean Observing System and the Global Climate Observing System, suffer from funding shortages. \n               Global vision \n             Yet since the Johannesburg summit, high-level political backing for GEOSS has coalesced relatively quickly. In 2003, ministers from 33 countries and representatives of the European Union (EU) attended the first global Earth Observation Summit in Washington DC. Interest swelled and by February this year, 58 governments had signed a cooperative agreement in Brussels. Such international attention could keep the pressure on individual governments to stay with GEOSS, says Don Hinsman, director of the space programme at the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) in Geneva. \u201cThat type of visibility will only ensure continued support,\u201d he says. But some countries are hesitant to climb on board. For instance, Tanzania's government has yet to consider joining. Mohammed Mhita, director-general of the Tanzania Meteorological Agency, and other supporters are working out how to encourage the financial investment for computing power and high-speed telecommunications needed to take full advantage of GEOSS. They are also discussing which organization should take the lead on national efforts. And in Saudi Arabia, some scientists have spoken of difficulties in getting data from their own country's sources. Secretive governments may not want to share their data but \u201cit becomes harder to hold out in an interconnected world\u201d says Joanne Gabrynowicz, a US delegate to several recent GEOSS meetings and the director of the National Remote Sensing and Space Law Center of the University of Mississippi. Other nations may feel they could lose their self-sufficiency if they share too much, says John Zillman, president of the Australian Academy of Technological Sciences and Engineering, and former president of the WMO. Under GEOSS, he notes, a researcher could sit in the United States and produce forecasts for regions thousands of miles away. \u201cHow is the national meteorological survey of Nigeria going to feel?\u201d he asks. \u201cAre they going to be happy to see their data flowing freely, while you in the United States perform their forecasts? That's the dilemma.\u201d Such issues are also a concern for emerging world powers. India, which has a strong telecommunications and scientific infrastructure, has been reluctant to share data from its network of seismometers. Because the information is considered vital to national security, the government prevents it from being sent out in real time \u2014 a serious potential problem for the fledgling Indian Ocean tsunami warning system. Some data are held indefinitely as they may pertain to nuclear testing. And economic considerations also come into play: satellite images and other kinds of high-resolution data are sometimes reserved for sale. In many cases, GEOSS might allow countries to keep sensitive data to themselves, while sharing information that could benefit other countries. \u201cWe look at GEOSS to contribute, but we also look at it to benefit us in areas where we don't have missions,\u201d says Mukund Rao, a geologist at the Indian Space Research Organisation and president of the Global Spatial Data Infrastructure Association. For instance, India has no ocean observations that track sea-surface height and temperature and so might be interested in acquiring them through GEOSS. But even the most dedicated countries, such as the United States, cannot guarantee their long-term support. Several US Earth-observing projects \u2014 such as the collection of national measurements of streamflow by the US Geological Survey \u2014 are losing funding. And the US government only recently made plans to launch the successor to the Landsat 7 remote sensing satellite. Now, there may be a potential gap of several years before the next-generation Landsat is launched. GEOSS' birth pangs might be lessened, say observers, if the programme models itself on the WMO. With 187 member countries and territories, most with their own meteorological division, the body has had great success in sharing databases. It took years for countries to make sure their data were in the correct format for sharing, and to figure out how to get the information to each other, says Zillman \u2014 but they did it in the end. GEOSS is already taking its first steps in this direction: at a meeting in May, participants agreed in principle to accept carefully worded language on how to retain control over data while pledging to share them. For now, GEOSS is housed at the WMO's offices in Geneva, under an independent coordinating secretariat. Some observers think GEOSS should be moved under the auspices of the United Nations (UN), whereas others wonder if it should remain an independent organization, much like the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. \u201cThere are arguments for both,\u201d says Vice Admiral Conrad Lautenbacher, head of the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Adminstration and a driving force behind GEOSS. In its current independent state, GEOSS \u201cdoesn't have the huge bureaucracy, procedures and baggage that you have as a formal UN organization\u201d Lautenbacher says. Instead, the relatively informal coalition allows parties to talk to each other in a non-threatening forum. On the other hand, although the UN infrastructure may be unwieldy, the UN provides a venue where countries are used to dealing with each other, which might be important for building trust, says Zillman. However it ends up being structured, GEOSS has the potential to reshape the face of Earth observing supporters say. If the early momentum can be sustained, the spies will start sharing crucial observations. Earth science will benefit from the silence being broken. \n                     Global observation project gets green light \n                   \n                     Making sense of the world \n                   \n                     Group on Earth Observations (GEO) \n                   \n                     European Space Agency's Earth Observations Portal \n                   \n                     NOAA's earth observing site \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Alison Abbott joined 44 Nobel laureates as they mingled with young scientists. For the past 55 years, a remarkable gathering of minds has been taking place in a small town in Germany. Behind closed doors, Nobel laureates have come from all corners of the globe to meet local students. This year, for the first time, the rest of the world has been invited and some 700 international students have joined the party. \u201cI can't believe my luck,\u201d says Evan Thomas, a chemist working on his PhD in Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge, on the first evening. \u201cI don't know what I'm going to say to them, but I'll definitely say something having come all this way.\u201d Qi Zhang, a PhD student from the Fourth Military Medical University in Xi'an, China, is bubbling over with excitement following a chat with 1978 medicine laureate, Werner Arber. \u201cHe discovered restriction enzymes...what we use in the lab all the time...we couldn't work without them...I was talking with him...I can't believe it.\u201d The story of these unusual gatherings begins in postwar Germany. It involves a count, a casino and the small medieval island town of Lindau on Lake Constance. And it has a happy ending: after years of financial struggles, the 2005 Lindau meeting has made the switch from parochial to international, has put its funding on a firmer footing and is using English \u2014 for the first time \u2014 as its official language. \u201cThe meetings very much needed to become international,\u201d says Arber, a regular Lindau attendee. \u201cThe German students attending needed that boost \u2014 they were becoming complacent.\u201d And times have changed, he notes, since the meeting was conceived in 1949. Back then, Lindau was under French occupation. It was an unlikely time and place to plan an international gathering of Nobel laureates: Germany was destroyed as a scientific, as well as a political, force. Despite this, three local personalities, who saw science as a promoter of \u2018peace and brotherhood\u2019, managed to bring laureates to Lindau. The original idea belonged to Gustav Parade, a doctor at the Lindau district hospital, who wanted to do something about the scientific isolation of Germany in his field. He teamed up with a local gynaecologist, Franz Karl Hein, to propose inviting Nobel laureates in physiology or medicine for discussions with doctors and scientists from around Germany. \n               In for the count \n             Emboldened by the backing of the mayor of Lindau, in early 1950 the two men boated across Lake Constance to the tiny \u2018flower island\u2019 of Mainau. There they sought the support of its owner, Count Lennart Bernadotte, great grandson of King Oscar II, who presented the first Nobel awards in 1901. The count did not hesitate, and his patronage became the hallmark of the annual meetings until he died last December at the age of 95. Tireless in his dedication to the cause he would stand in line with autograph hunters at the Stockholm Nobel award ceremony for the opportunity to persuade new laureates to take part in the Lindau meetings. In the early days it was hard to find cash within Germany's ruined economy for such an indulgence. But political confusion came to the rescue. Being the only corner of Bavaria not under US occupation, Lindau enjoyed a special administrative status that allowed it to sidestep gambling laws. Soon, the town established the Bayerische Spielbank Casino, which became a major source of funding for the meetings. Attracting Nobel laureates turned out to be the easy part. The first European Meeting of Nobel Laureates in Medicine, in June 1951, was attended by six German laureates and one from the United States as well as some 400 physicians. It was deemed by all to be a big success, although the Swedish Nobel Foundation, which saw Stockholm as the laureates' only legitimate home base, was unimpressed. Tensions have eased in recent years, but the foundation has never formally endorsed the series. During the first 50 years, a rhythm was established, with meetings rotating between medicine, chemistry and physics. Students, mostly German undergraduates selected according to academic performance, soon replaced the physicians of the first meeting. They enjoyed not only morning lectures, but also the informal company of Nobel laureates during afternoon discussions, a dinner and dance on the first evening, and the traditional final-day boat trip to Mainau as guests of the count. The laureates quickly came to love the formula, and many come as often as their schedules allow. \u201cI must hold an attendance record,\u201d boasts Ivar Giaever, who won the physics prize in 1973 and has been to every physics meeting since. \u201cThey make me feel like a king!\u201d But the series has been on the verge of financial collapse several times. Federal and regional governments came to the rescue in 1970, but it was not until the 50th meeting in 2000 that a formal foundation was established to put it on more secure ground. And despite their old-world charm, the Lindau meetings had become an anachronism. Germany was no longer scientifically isolated, and the privileged access to laureates was harder to justify. The failure to recognize English as the international language of science reinforced the air of provincialism. In the past few years, some laureates became worried that unless they opened up to the world, new laureates would not make the time to come. At the same time Count Lennart was ageing \u2014 and he was keen to ensure continuation after his death. \n               Glittering prize \n             From 2001, the new foundation's 14-strong committee began to sort out the meetings' finances, and to make them more relevant to science as practised today. They invited scientific academies and other agencies around the world to open competitions for young scientists to attend, then whittled down a list of nearly 10,000 applicants. The final 2005 list of 720 invitees represented a new profile of participant: academically excellent, familiar with societal impacts of their research and fluent in English. They are generally under 30, but the majority are now PhD students or postdocs, pushing up the general level of education. The weekly schedule of the meetings remains the same, although the lectures are also broadcast live on the Internet. And economics now takes its turn \u2014 the first such gathering last year attracted 11 economics laureates. And as of this year, medicine, chemistry and physics will all meet together every five years. Some things haven't changed \u2014 most notably curiosity about Nobel prizewinners as human beings. Even the laureates confess to curiosity \u2014 and sometimes reverence \u2014 for each other. \u201cI met Dirac once,\u201d recalls Giaever with relish, referring to Paul Dirac, the legendary, but famously withdrawn, 1933 physics laureate who theorized the existence of antimatter. \u201cHe was very quiet, very quiet.\u201d Some students entertain hopes that they may be recruited into a Nobel lab, as has happened on several occasions. Others long for insight into a secret formula that could help their own quests for success. \u201cI want to learn from them how to think: what is the right thought process and where do you begin,\u201d says Steve Bull, a doctoral student in chemistry at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois. Another student wanted to know if the laureates thought that they had simply been in the right place at the right time. \u201cThere is a bit of that,\u201d admits G\u00fcnter Blobel (medicine, 1999). \u201cBut it isn't the whole story.\u201d Giaever sees more diversity among his fellow laureates: \u201cNobel laureates are like the rest of the world \u2014 some are smart, some are average and some are dumb.\u201d Blobel learned something, in turn, about the young scientists. \u201cIt is curious to see the questions that students from different cultures ask,\u201d he remarked after a discussion on evolutionary biology led by Christian de Duve (medicine, 1974). He was taken aback to find some students expressing so much interest in the \u2018creative guiding hand\u2019 of intelligent design. \n               Political science \n             Past Lindau meetings have had politics as well as science on the agenda. Back in 1955, some 18 laureates who had been involved in nuclear research, including Werner Heisenberg (physics, 1932), were invited to the chemists' meeting. There they signed the \u2018Mainau declaration\u2019, which called on governments to abandon the development of nuclear weapons, and played an important role in the 1950s ban-the-bomb campaigns. Since then, many laureates, most prominently Albert Einstein (physics, 1921), have used their fame to push political agendas, mostly promoting peace or equality. Just last month, 18 laureates signed a petition calling for stronger political leadership on neglected diseases. Several at the 2005 Lindau meeting say they have launched petitions of their own. Others say that they prefer to stay out of politics altogether. \u201cI know nothing more than any man on the street and have never signed a petition that identified me as a Nobel prizewinner\u201d, says Robert Richardson (physics, 1996). But politics is never entirely forgotten in Lindau. In their lectures, many laureates recall their personal debts to Jewish scientists driven from Hitler's Germany to seed frontline research in the United States and elsewhere. And the philosophy of the new-style meetings is to support excellence in science wherever in the world political or social oppression may seek to stifle individuals. Aside from such serious issues, Lindau exerts a simpler magic as well. \u201cIt's nice here,\u201d answered Masatoshi Koshiba (physics, 2002) when asked why he had come. \u201cI just heard it was really good,\u201d said William Lipscomb (chemistry, 1976), whose wife added pointedly: \u201cAnd I wanted to come.\u201d Klaus von Klitzing (physics, 1985), who could be spotted rock-and-roll dancing with students on the first night, claimed it had always been his ambition to get in. He tried to get an invitation as a student, but was turned down. \u201cSo I knew I just had to win a Nobel prize if I wanted to attend,\u201d he smiles. \n                     Star quality \n                   \n                     Nobel laureates spearhead effort to put Kerry in the White House \n                   \n                     Deep roots of Nazi science revealed \n                   \n                     Meetings of Nobel Laureates in Lindau \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Carina Dennis finds out how she counters her critics. Fiona Wood is in a rush. Colleagues say she wants everything yesterday. A master of multitasking, she travels exhaustively and handles a hefty clinical and research load. It is this boundless energy and sense of urgency that drove the surgeon to develop a pioneering treatment to help burns victims. Originally from Yorkshire, UK, Wood now heads a burns unit at the Royal Perth Hospital in Western Australia, where she has developed a technique called \u2018spray-on skin\u2019. It literally involves spraying a patient's wounds with their own skin cells, and works much faster than conventional methods. Wood says this speed helps minimize scarring and accelerates recovery. Her method was put to the test under horrific circumstances in October 2002, when victims of the Bali terrorist bomb were flown to her unit. Her team worked around the clock, and managed to save all but three of the 28 patients who arrived. The incident propelled Wood into the media spotlight and she was named Australian of the Year 2005. But fellow surgeons and scientists argue that her spray-on skin hasn't been proven to work. Unless it is subjected to rigorous clinical trials, it will never become accepted clinical practice, they say. Unfazed, Wood says her method is a key step towards scarless healing and will be useful in other routine surgical procedures, such as scar repair and cosmetic surgery. Burns can be truly gruesome injuries. Without skin, the body weeps copious fluids and is dangerously vulnerable to infection. If a patient survives, they face living with disfiguring scars that tighten and restrict movement. Although Wood is very matter-of-fact when she talks about burns, she is still overwhelmed by the suffering of her patients, especially children. \u201cThe day you stop being affected, is the day you should hang up your boots in my opinion,\u201d she says. How a burn is treated depends on the extent of the damage to the two layers that make up our skin. The upper epidermis contains keratinocytes, the cells that make keratin, which forms a tough protective sheath. The lower dermis is composed largely of cells called fibroblasts, which make collagen, giving skin its durability and elasticity. Shallow burns that singe the epidermis are left to heal on their own. But when the burn is deeper and more extensive, skin grafts are used. Thin strips of the patient's healthy skin are shaved off a donor site, taking mostly epidermis and a little dermis, and stretched over the exposed wounds. For severely burned patients, donor sites often need to be reharvested, but they usually take up to two weeks to grow back. An alternative is to use sheets of the patient's cultured skin cells, but these take three weeks to grow. Treating severe burns is a race against time. \u201cSeventy-five per cent of burn scarring remains permanent if it's not healed within 21 days,\u201d says Wood. It also becomes a numbers game: the more burns there are, the less healthy skin there is available to harvest and cover the wounds. To buy time, surgeons can use coverings made from cadaver skin or manufactured sheets of foreskin cells. \u201cBut as these do not contain the patient's cells, they do not always result in permanent wound closure,\u201d says Wood. \n               Driven to act \n             A key turning point for Wood came in 1990, when she was part of a team caring for a patient with severe burns. The group was experimenting with the then-new technique of growing sheets of skin cells derived from the patient. The cells had just begun to \u2018take\u2019 when the patient \u2014 who had survived for seven months \u2014 died from an infection that had invaded while her skin was missing. \u201cI was overwhelmed by the thought that we had to be able to do better,\u201d says Wood. \u201cIf we'd been quicker, the outcome might have been different.\u201d A few years later, she did do better. Wood recruited Marie Stoner, a cell biologist, and together they reduced the time for culturing a patient's skin cells from weeks to just five days. There was no magic, says Wood; rather, they simply whittled down the time to grow skin cells and sprayed them onto the burn using a syringe with a spray nozzle attached. Wood's method \u2014 which she dubbed CellSpray \u2014 involves taking a skin sample about the size of a postage stamp, scraping off the keratinocytes and multiplying them in tissue culture for several days. The cells are then harvested and sprayed onto the wound 1 . But CellSpray is not the whole solution. Wood often uses it in conjunction with traditional grafts. Keratinocytes need a healthy underlying dermis as an anchor point and source of nutrients. So if the burn has damaged or destroyed the dermis, Wood uses a skin graft before spraying it with the cultured cells. If the dermis is lost completely, it first has to be rebuilt using either a much thicker skin graft or an artificial protein scaffold into which fibroblasts and other cells migrate. After a few weeks, the epidermis can then be added over the top by grafting as well as spraying. CellSpray was first used on patients in 1995 and has been routinely deployed in Wood's burns unit ever since. She is adamant that it leads to faster healing and reduces scarring. It also requires fewer donor sites \u2014 particularly useful for severely burnt patients. But Wood's peers are sceptical. Peter Haertsch, head of burns and reconstructive surgery at Concord Hospital in Sydney, Australia, says it's a brilliant idea but argues that there is not enough evidence that it works. Haertsch is strongly critical, even though he is experimenting with the technique in his own unit. But he is not alone \u2014 the burns specialists interviewed for this article agreed that randomized clinical trials are needed. There is also some doubt over whether the spray-on cells fall off over time. For this reason, Haertsch says it's unclear how much the spray actually contributes to wound healing compared with the underlying skin graft and cells migrating in from surrounding tissues. But Wood believes her results speak for themselves. \u201cThe evidence is borne out by experience,\u201d she says. She and her staff are convinced that patients suffer significantly less scarring thanks to the technique. As a result, she feels it would be unethical to do clinical trials in which some patients get spray-on skin whereas others get conventional grafts. Furthermore, it is difficult to compare burns treatments because of the variability of the wounds. Wood has published some results using spray-on skin in animal models 2 , 3 , but she acknowledges that she won't convince her peers without clinical trials and has helped to design a multicentre randomized trial to be conducted in Australia and internationally. This will involve patients who have burns to more than 20% of their body. Each patient will receive traditional skin grafts on one side of their body and spray-on cells plus a skin graft on the other side. Wood and her team are conducting a complementary study in which they are comparing the outcomes for their patients with those at other units who have received conventional treatment. While experts ponder its value, Wood has ambitious plans for CellSpray. She thinks it could also be useful for minimizing scarring in routine surgical procedures such as repairing birthmarks or removing moles. A kit for the method, called ReCell, is being distributed by Clinical Cell Culture, a company that Wood co-founded in 1999. It has been submitted for approval by regulatory agencies including the US Food and Drug Administration and its Australian equivalent, the Therapeutic Goods Administration, and has recently been approved for clinical use in the European Union and Japan. \n               Reluctant entrepreneur \n             Wood says that commercializing her work has been an \u201ceducational experience\u201d but adds that she doesn't feel comfortable in the role. Rather, she sees it as a means to raise funds for the non-profit McComb Foundation, which supports burns research using her company's profits. Ultimately, Wood wants to achieve healing without scars. She is now trying to combine the reconstruction of the dermis and epidermis into a single step. To do this, she sprays keratinocytes onto Integra, an artificial scaffold derived from shark cartilage and cow collagen. This is then applied to the wound, where the dermal cells move into the scaffold to regenerate the dermis, and the keratinocytes migrate to the top to rebuild the epidermis. Wood's team claims success with a mouse model and hopes to test the technique in patients soon. The team is also trying to improve artificial scaffolds and is using three-dimensional scans to build a picture of skin topography, burns and the healing process at different sites of the body. The ultimate goal is to use computer technology to scan patients and predict the best treatment for different burns. Wood adds that this will help to quantify the outcome of her treatments, and hopefully appease her critics. Although she is an enthusiast of basic research, Wood's clinical pragmatism never subsides. \u201cIt might be nice science, but I need to be able to use it,\u201d says Wood.

A highly pathogenic strain of avian influenza is endemic in southeast Asia. Many millions of chickens have been culled, but there is a persistent reservoir in domesticated ducks and wild birds. The H5N1 virus isn't going to go away. And each time it emerges, people can be infected. H5N1 first reared its head in Hong Kong and southern China in 1997, killing six. Since late 2003, it has led to the deaths of more than 50 people in Vietnam, Thailand and Cambodia. The stage is set for the emergence of a fresh human influenza pandemic. These occur when a virus to which most people have no immunity, usually an avian strain, acquires the ability to transmit readily from person to person. H5N1 hasn't yet gained that ability \u2014 and hopefully, it will not. But if it does, the virus could spread across the globe within months. The consequences are difficult to predict. We're unlikely to be as lucky as in 1968, when the relatively mild H3N2 virus killed some 750,000 people worldwide. But the real nightmare scenario is a re-run of the H1N1 flu pandemic of 1918, which left as many as 40 million dead. Standards of health care have improved a lot since then, which will help. But if a pandemic strain were to retain H5N1's current extreme pathogenicity, a similar toll can't be ruled out. This week,  Nature  devotes its News Feature and Commentary pages to a detailed consideration of the risks posed by avian flu, and how well we are prepared to deal with it. In the pages that follow, our reporters examine nations' capacity to produce a vaccine against a pandemic strain, and the adequacy of global stockpiles of antiviral drugs. They do not paint an encouraging picture. Repeated warnings about the international community's failure to respond to the pandemic threat have fallen on deaf ears. So in our opening News Feature, we use the benefit of fictional hindsight to throw the issues into starker relief, describing a future pandemic through the weblog of a journalist in the thick of things. This is fiction, but not fantasy \u2014 the storyline was drawn up in consultation with those who could soon be dealing with the situation for real. In our extended Commentary section, starting on  page 415 , experts who are grappling with the issues tackle some hard questions. Which nations are ready, and which are not? David Ho asks if China is in a better position to cope with new microbial threats since the 2003 SARS outbreak. And Anthony Fauci outlines what US researchers are doing to develop vaccines and drugs. Asian countries are the most immediately vulnerable. Robert Webster and Diane Hulse address the possibility of controlling flu outbreaks in these nations at source, pointing to two examples of successful intervention to wipe out the disease in poultry \u2014 in Hong Kong in 1997 and more recently in Thailand. Joining up the dots between animal and human health is also the concern of Albert Osterhaus and his colleagues. They propose a permanent global flu task force to strengthen coordination among agencies on the ground. If we are fortunate, we may still have the time to take these messages on board. As Michael Osterholm warns in his Commentary, a flu pandemic could bring human tragedy and a global economic catastrophe. Let's hope world leaders heed the warnings. \n                     Dangerous state of denial \n                   \n                     We have been warned \n                   \n                     Avian flu web focus \n                   \n                     Bird flu in focus \n                   \n                     CDC Influenza \n                   \n                     WHO Avian Influenza \n                   \n                     FAO Avian Influenza \n                   \n                     OIE Avian Influenza \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

His specially trained editor hunts for tell-tale lines or smudges that might reveal where inappropriate modifications have been made \u2014 and when found, Rossner asks the authors for their original data. In the vast majority of cases, the perpetrators aren't willfully misrepresenting their results \u2014 rather, they are unaware that their efforts to achieve the cleanest images for publication have crossed the line of acceptability. Such ignorance is widespread, and for Rossner it underlines why his journal now subjects all accepted papers to image forensics. \u201cMy goal is to catch problems before we publish,\u201d he says. The availability of digital cameras and image-manipulation programs such as Photoshop has made it all too easy for researchers to enhance the DNA bands on a gel or brighten up the images of cells snapped on a slide. Most alterations are harmless: researchers legitimately crop a picture or enhance a faint, fluorescently tagged protein. But in some cases, innocent attempts to clarify an image can erase valuable data or raise suspicions of fabrication. Following Rossner's lead, other journal editors now scrutinize images more carefully than they used to. And researchers, some burnt by questions about their own photos' integrity, are beginning to patrol the activities of their lab members. \u201cWe all underestimate the amount of skullduggery that goes on,\u201d says Joseph Gall, who studies the structure of cell nuclei at the Carnegie Institution in Baltimore, Maryland. \n               Picture perfect \n             Biologists have always gone to great lengths to create beautiful pictures that best illustrate their data. Geneticists carry out multiple exposures of radioactively labelled DNA fragments separated on gels in order to create a crisp image. Cell biologists once worked through rolls of film to grab the perfect shot from a microscope. But with Photoshop, a few clicks of the mouse can transform a featureless black microscope snap into a starry vista littered with labelled proteins. \u201cYou can make up almost any image you want nowadays,\u201d says Tom Misteli, a cell biologist at the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland. Some biologists seem to succumb to this temptation. In 1989\u201390, only 2.5% of allegations examined by the US Office of Research Integrity, which monitors misconduct in biomedical research, involved contested scientific images. By 2001, this figure had jumped to nearly 26% (ref.  1 ). But such miscreants are in the minority. The more pressing problem, say experts, is that innocent efforts to smarten or prettify images end up with unintended consequences. At the very least, biologists risk erasing potentially valuable information, such as low levels of fluorescently labelled protein swilling around a cell's cytoplasm. At worst, such manipulations can lead researchers to the wrong scientific conclusions. In some cases, researchers may not even realize that they are significantly altering an image, particularly when the changes are made at the time a picture is taken, by adjusting settings such as the exposure on microscopes or digital cameras. Many scientists are oblivious to the consequences of such actions, because they have only a rudimentary knowledge of the sophisticated equipment involved. But it is the use of Photoshop or similar software to alter an original picture that scientists and editors say is most troublesome. With these programs, researchers can quickly carry out an array of modifications, from slicing off the messy edges of an image to using sophisticated algorithms to sharpen the edges of a blurred image on a microscope slide.  No one wants to ban image manipulation outright. In cell-biology experiments, for example, researchers often have to adjust the relative intensities of red, green and blue fluorescent markers in order to show all three in a single image. Even drastic changes are sometimes considered tolerable if scientists spell out exactly what they did. But it is tough to draw a precise line between acceptable and unacceptable image manipulation. Few journals have explicit policies, and of those that do,  The Journal of Cell Biology  has the most stringent guidelines 2 . These allow alterations that are applied equally across an entire image, such as changes to contrast or brightness. They also permit some other corrections, such as adjusting the brightness of pixels in a certain range of colours \u2014 but only if details of the adjustment are spelled out. Changes to selected parts of an image, such as brightening one cell in an entire field or scrubbing out an ugly blemish, are prohibited. \n               Blurred vision \n             Rossner estimates that roughly 20% of accepted manuscripts contain at least one figure that has to be remade because of inappropriate image manipulation. In the vast majority of cases, the authors have made the changes innocently, and can provide acceptable images once the problem has been explained. In rare cases where the journal suspects misconduct, the authors' institutions are informed.  For their part, scientists say that they feel under pressure to produce faultless images to present convincing experiments that reviewers and editors want to publish. \u201cThe temptation comes from the fact that you have to sell a clear-cut story,\u201d Misteli says. Tweaking images is also seductive in a way that adjusting statistics is not, because of the natural human desire to create an aesthetically pleasing picture. Cell-signalling researcher Shigemi Matsuyama is one biologist who discovered the pitfalls of Photoshop when the images in a 2003  Nature Cell Biology  paper 3  were called into question. His study showed how a protein called Bax, which is involved in triggering cell death, is controlled by a second protein called Ku70. At the time, Matsuyama was excited about the publication, which was his first after setting up his lab at the Blood Research Institute in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. But his elation turned to despair when a colleague in the field contacted him and  Nature Cell Biology 's editors a few months later to point out some troubling features in several images. The pictures were of western blots, a technique in which a labelled antibody is washed over several protein samples and bands on the blot to reveal which of the proteins bind to the antibody. Enlarging several of these images revealed straight lines on either side of some bands, suggesting that they had been pasted together on a computer. \u201cI was stunned,\u201d Matsuyama says. \u201cI couldn't eat for almost a week.\u201d The first author of the paper, postdoctoral researcher Motoshi Sawada, had used Photoshop to put together some of the western blot images. In one example, he cut out a band from one position on the blot and pasted it into a second spot. In another, he reused bands from one blot in two separate figures. Sawada says that he felt under pressure to produce the figures quickly, and that one of the changes was a genuine mistake. He adds that he made the others so that the figures were clear and easy to understand. \u201cI thought that it was acceptable,\u201d he says. In the event, Sawada and Matsuyama went back to the original data, and were able to produce corrected figures that confirmed their original scientific conclusions. These were published in a 2004 corrigendum 4 . \n               Image problem \n             Sawada's case seems to be fairly typical. Scientists and journal editors say that most questionable image manipulation can be traced to inexperienced students or lab staff who are unclear about what is allowable. \u201cIt's junior people tidying up the image and not realizing that what they're doing is wrong,\u201d says Richard Sever, executive editor for the  Journal of Cell Science , based in Cambridge, UK. But whoever the perpetrators are, and whatever their motivation may be, there is so far little consensus about how to curtail them. One way, researchers say, would be to teach budding biologists about the ethics of image-making during postgraduate courses. Another is for lab heads to be more rigorous about policing inexperienced lab members. Matsuyama, for one, now demands that his students and postdocs show him the original image alongside the final form that they want to submit for publication. Journal editors are also recognizing that they have a role to play. The  Journal of Cell Science  plans to draw up image manipulation guidelines for its authors within the next three months;  Nature Cell Biology  is encouraging researchers to submit original images of gels alongside the edited ones, for publication as supplementary information 5 . Another option would be for journals to demand that authors list the image adjustments they make in methods sections or figure legends. Despite their heightened level of scrutiny, editors still fret that their forensic efforts will be outpaced by rapid advances in image-manipulation software, and researchers' skill at using it \u2014 the minority of biologists who are deliberately bending the rules are only likely to get better at covering their tracks. \u201cWe're just fortunate that most students and postdocs are not that good in Photoshop yet,\u201d Rossner says. \n                     http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/feature031124-9 \n                   \n                     http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/424870a \n                   \n                     Cell & Molecular Biology news \n                   \n                     Nature Cell Biology \n                   \n                     Landmark papers in cell biology 2004 \n                   \n                     The Journal of Cell Biology \n                   \n                     Journal of Cell Science \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Jonathan Knight tunes in to see how these motorized models can expose what makes real creatures behave the way they do. As the sage grouse gather on the Wyoming prairie to find mates this spring, a few of the strutting, posturing males are in for a surprise. One of the hens they'll be trying to court will be a mechanized impostor rolling around on tracks from a model railroad. A dozen metres away, crouching in the brush, behavioural biologist Gail Patricelli will be guiding its every move by remote control \u2014 ready to rescue her decoy should things get out of hand. \u201cThe worst-case scenarios are the bird derails and gets torn up by the males, or an eagle swoops in and grabs it,\u201d says Patricelli. Either would put an abrupt end to an experiment she has spent months setting up. Patricelli, an assistant professor at the University of California, Davis, is one of several technically savvy biologists who have latched on to the use of robotics in behavioural studies. Radio transmitters, computer chips, digital cameras and audio recorders have become smaller and cheaper, placing home-made robots within the reach of even junior researchers on a tight budget. As a result, a menagerie of robots \u2014 from squirrels to lobsters \u2014 has been deployed to test ideas about animal behaviour that had previously been too tricky to tackle. Robots are making new avenues of research possible, says behaviouralist Christopher Evans at Macquarie University in Sydney, Australia. \u201cWe tend to seize on technologies like this and say: \u2018I've been waiting to do that experiment for 20 years, and now I can\u2019,\u201d he says. Among the first to explore the potential of mechanized animals was Axel Michelsen at the University of Southern Denmark in Odense. In the early 1990s, he built a mechanically controlled honeybee of wax-coated brass to help him decode the insects' dances, which tell others in the hive where to find food. The brass bee was slightly larger than normal and had just one wing, fashioned from a broken razor blade. It didn't look much like a real bee. Fortunately, beehives are completely dark. Because they can't see the dancer, honeybees perceive its movements mainly through the pulsing currents of air it creates. By making his bee perform sections of the dance to an audience of real bees, Michelsen discovered how the dance revealed both the direction to and the distance from food 1 . \n               Wired for romance \n             Patricelli was so fascinated by this approach that she built a robot bird for her postdoctoral research on the courtship of satin bowerbirds ( Ptilonorhynchus violaceus ). It was fairly simple: a stuffed female that could crouch, turn its head and fluff its feathers at the tweak of a joystick. To real males it was utterly convincing. Patricelli found that males modified the intensity of their display in response to cues from the female: hamming it up if she seemed receptive and toning it down if she was aloof 2 . The bowerbird has been retired to a cardboard box while Patricelli works on the more sophisticated grouse-bot. This radio-controlled model not only turns and makes provocative crouching movements, it is also equipped with video and audio recorders to catch the males' responses. The point of the experiment is to monitor the grouse's mating signals. \u201cIt's very hard to tease apart the conversation when you are just watching from the outside. But when you control one side of it, you get a better idea of what is going on,\u201d Patricelli says. Sage grouse ( Centrocercus urophasianus ) mate in leks, open fields where males strut around, displaying their feathers and emitting a loud drumming noise from vocal sacs on their chests. Like real females, the robot will wander through the lek, \u2018observing\u2019 different males and showing interest by moving its hindquarters. Patricelli hopes to learn which of the hen's moves are most exciting to a male and how he responds. Giving a robot natural movement is fairly easy for birds, as their motion is somewhat jerky and robotic to begin with. In fact, the wheeling motion of Patricelli's grouse may be a bit smooth, but that won't necessarily matter, as animals seem to respond to very specific cues when identifying members of their own species. For instance, Evans and his Macquarie colleague Ann G\u00f6th last year built a series of robot chicks to find out what cues newly hatched brush turkeys ( Alectura lathami ) look for in spotting their nest mates. All the robots looked the same, but it was the one that made the jerky pecking motion typical of game birds that got all the attention 3 . Robots are also proving their worth in studying communication between different species. Just across campus from Patricelli is a room housing several dozen rattlesnakes ( Crotalus viridis ) that, courtesy of graduate student Aaron Rundus, face regular encounters with a robot squirrel. California ground squirrels ( Spermophilus beecheyi ) are a favourite prey of rattlesnakes, but they are not always easy targets. Adults are resistant to snake venom and so can be quite bold, often driving off a snake with an aggressive display that involves swinging their tail like a windscreen wiper. What is unique about this display is that it seems to use both visual and infrared cues. Rattlesnakes are exquisitely sensitive to heat, and a squirrel will heat up its tail by as much as 2 \u00b0C during tail-flagging. As Rundus told the annual meeting of the Animal Behavior Society in Oaxaca, Mexico, last June, the same squirrel seems to keep its tail cool when flagging a heat-insensitive gopher snake ( Pituophis melanoleucus ). To test how much the rattlers' response is influenced by the heat signal, Rundus teamed up with Davis mechanical engineer Sanjay Joshi to rig a stuffed squirrel with a motorized, heat-controlled tail. Rundus is coy about discussing his unpublished findings, but hints that things are going well. What's important, Rundus says, is that robotics has made possible a controlled experiment that couldn't have been done in the wild \u2014 there is no way to convince a squirrel to keep its tail cool when facing a rattler. \u201cThis is long overdue in behavioural biology,\u201d he says. \n               Mock lobster \n             Researchers can learn a lot by building robots that mimic animal behaviour, even if the machines don't interact with live creatures. For instance, Frank Grasso, director of the Biomimetic and Cognitive Robotics Lab at the City University of New York in Brooklyn, has studied how lobsters sniff out their prey by using a robo-lobster that follows a scented plume in the water. \u201cThe robots allowed us to improve on ideas that had been around for a long time,\u201d he says. It had been assumed that lobsters locate their prey by swimming towards higher concentrations of odour. But in lab trials, a robo-lobster working on this principle alone did poorly, particularly if it was a long way from its target. Guessing that this might be the result of turbulence muddying the odour gradient in the water, Grasso's team gave the robot a sense of flow, allowing it to assume that odours come from upstream. The robot then behaved much more like the real thing 4 . But even so it didn't quite act naturally. Grasso has continued to refine the model, for instance by adding a memory algorithm to help it if it loses the odour plume. \u201cThis is allowing us to build step by step a model of what is going on in the lobster's brain,\u201d he says. The approach has its limits. Even if the real and fake lobsters behave the same, there is no direct test to show that the robot algorithm and a lobster's brain are making decisions in the same way. But such experiments can at least establish a minimum, says psychologist Jeffrey Schank, who is working with Joshi to build robotic rats that also follow simple behavioural rules. \u201cIf we can get robots to mimic the rats, that's the first step to understanding them,\u201d Joshi explains. The robo-rats are entirely autonomous, and make decisions about where to go based on which sensors are activated in combination with a probability algorithm programmed into their computer brains 5 . For Schank the important question is: how little does the brain have to do? \u201cWe are trying to quantify the lowest level of cognitive ability necessary for certain types of behaviour,\u201d he says. This can then feed into theories of how animals behave in the wild. Certainly, the robotic toolbox has only just been prised open. In addition to one-on-one interactions, some researchers are looking at group behaviour. A European team led by Jean-Louis Deneubourg at the Free University of Brussels has built robo-roaches that can interact with groups of live cockroaches. The researchers are using them to understand collective decision-making, such as choosing a safe hiding place. The herd instinct may also encourage more behavioural researchers to use robots. \u201cEvery time I go to a conference, I hear about more people using robots,\u201d says Patricelli. \u201cIt's catching on.\u201d \n                     http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/news010913-1 \n                   \n                     http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/417359a \n                   \n                     http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/nature02024 \n                   \n                     http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/news040614-3 \n                   \n                     Gail Patricelli Lab \n                   \n                     Biomimetic and Cognitive Robotics Lab \n                   \n                     Robotics, Autonomous Systems, and Controls Laboratory (RASCAL) \n                   \n                     roboroach \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Alison Abbott takes a masterclass in sorcery.  It seemed rude to leave the lecture hall when the president of the Max Planck Society had generously given the floor to a representative of the \u201cyoung generation of researchers\u201d in whose hands lie the \u201cfuture of science\u201d. Still, when Thomas Fraps thanked the society for the opportunity to speak for \u201c55 minutes on some of the many promising themes in science and medicine\u201d, some at the back did quietly slip away. The remaining audience grew visibly impatient as Fraps warmed to his theme. \u201cMy generation is aware of its growing responsibility to bring to the public an informed transfer of new scientific knowledge from the interdisciplinary dialogue within our universities...\u201d They had already sat through a long evening of televised discussion on bioethics, and there was something annoyingly smug, even odd, about this guy. And was his tie really getting longer? Fraps stepped away from the podium and began self-importantly to clean his glasses with a silk handkerchief from his pocket. Then he pulled the cloth straight through the lenses, flicked the silk to one side and revealed, in his previously empty hand, a glass of orange juice. \u201cCheers!\u201d he said, taking a sip. As the audience grasped that Fraps was a magician, astonished laughter erupted. The fact that he used expert scientific patter to accompany his traditional magic tricks added to the delight. A classical rope trick was a demonstration of molecular biology in action, the 2-metre rope representing a strand of DNA. In Fraps' hands, the two ends mysteriously became four, \u201cto better illustrate the four building blocks of life\u201d, and the rope became a joined circle to illustrate cell division. He used (invisible) \u2018genetic scissors\u2019 to snip out a mutated gene. And picking up the small pieces of rope that fell at his feet he recreated the single unbroken length. The climax of the performance came when Fraps pressed a member of the audience to invest in his research project on transgenic lemons. The \u2018volunteer\u2019 handed over a \u20ac10 note, after signing it. By sleight of hand Fraps turned the note into a worthless receipt. \u201cWell,\u201d he smiled, \u201cif you want good research, you need higher investment.\u201d But he later retrieved it from the dripping centre of a fresh, purportedly transgenic, lemon, cut open on stage. \u201cMy research project seems to have been worthwhile after all,\u201d he shouted over resounding cheers. Fraps earns his living by pretending to be an expert for a range of unsuspecting audiences, not only scientists. Mostly he entertains executives at corporate events for the car or computer industries, where his patter is linked to their professional interests. But his speciality is science-based stage shows, like his current two-hour  Metamagicum  show, centred on quantum physics. \n               Magic touch \n             If it hadn't been for his obsession with magic \u2014 he joined the Magic Circle in his native Munich when only 17 \u2014 Fraps might have been a conventional physicist. Occasional magic performances helped him pay his way through university, but he didn't think of turning professional. A short undergraduate stint at CERN, the European particle-physics laboratory near Geneva, taught him that the abstraction of quantum physics was not for him, and he began to think about a career in medical physics. Fatefully, he took a year out before his final exams to do magic \u2014 to get rid of the itch once and for all. But the \u2018cure\u2019 failed. Fraps believes that a scientific background can be advantageous for a magician. There are said to be only six conjuring effects, but hundreds of different ways of achieving them. Magicians mostly make tricks work by directing the audience's attention away from the object being manipulated. \u201cThis is why magic effects can't be separated from their presentation,\u201d says Fraps. That presentation must provide engaging storylines with enough logic to make the tricks plausible. \u201cThe audience has to believe a trick, so you have to construct a reality where they are going to see cause and effect.\u201d Scientific material makes that easier, he says. So his earlier struggles with quantum physics have now borne fruit, if not in the context his professors might have expected. \u201cIn  Metamagicum , I transpose a sock sealed in a milk bottle into a parallel universe by using a special machine \u2014 the Parallel-O-Meter. In my presentation, this does have internal logic, crazy or not,\u201d he says. Science is weird enough to allow for theoretical parallel universes, he explains, and he simply invents a gadget to do the job. Fraps sees similarities between Einstein's ideas of relativity and magic tricks. \u201cThe concept of mass or gravity influencing time blew my mind when I was a student,\u201d he says. \u201cMagic blows people's minds in just the same way, because they see something that contradicts everyday experience.\u201d Einstein famously said that \u201cthe most beautiful thing we can experience is the mysterious \u2014 it is the source of all true art and science\u201d. Fraps feels vindicated by this. \u201cMy choice to use scientific themes for magic presentation is an artistic one,\u201d he says. \n                     Metamagicum \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Quirin Schiermeier listens in. Enlightenment is hard work \u2014 especially when you mix philosophy with quantum physics. But the Dalai Lama is always keen to investigate areas of science, no matter how complex they seem. And in 1997, when he wanted to delve into the quantum world, one of the men he invited to India was Anton Zeilinger. Based at the University of Vienna in Austria, Zeilinger is committed to explaining his work to a broad audience. As a student, he was fascinated by both opera and the mathematical beauty of quantum mechanics. And although Zeilinger, who turns 60 in May, has just revived his old student hobby of playing walk-on parts at the Vienna State Opera House, it was fundamental physics that won his heart. Over the years, his scientific achievements, as well as his communication skills, have made him a media star, at least in his native Austria. \u201cExplaining science to the public is hard work,\u201d he says jovially, while clearing a spot on a visitor table that is overflowing with manuscripts. He knows that fellow researchers can be scornful of the media attention he gets. And he admits that he sometimes feels uneasy about popular portrayals of his work. When the leading German news magazine  Der Spiegel  last month featured him on its cover as \u2018The Sorcerer from Vienna\u2019, with a story full of references to time travel, parallel universes and pop culture, he was not too happy. But we need capable translators. Quantum mechanics so often contradicts our ideas of how cause and effect determine what we see, that many physicists struggle to accept its description of the physical world. Even Einstein felt notoriously spooked by the concept of quantum entanglement, in which independent quantum particles remain mysteriously linked. So journalists appreciate Zeilinger's ability to translate the mathematics into a working philosophy. Zeilinger is also happy discussing the challenges of quantum mechanics \u2014 both technical and philosophical. \u201cI strongly feel that we need to clearly tell the people what we don't understand,\u201d he says. For example, quantum physicists have yet to find a satisfying explanation for the randomness inherent in the quantum world. \u201cMysteries of that kind are among the biggest questions of the twenty-first century,\u201d Zeilinger says. When the Dalai Lama made a return visit to Zeilinger's lab, then in Innsbruck, a year after their first meeting, he confessed to having difficulties with the philosophical implications of quantum physics, especially the role of chance and causality in nature. As the idea of determinism is central to Buddhism, the existence of purely random acts might call into question Buddhist doctrine, he said. But Zeilinger is keen to stress that his research, and the ground-breaking quantum-optical experiments he has designed, are all explained by the known laws of physics. Less mysterious, perhaps, but equally fascinating. \n               A tangled tale \n             When a photon of polarized laser light passes into certain types of crystal, it can generate a pair of lower-energy photons that are \u2018entangled\u2019 in terms of their respective polarization \u2014 the vertical or horizontal direction in which they oscillate. In Zeilinger's hands, these entangled particles offer revolutionary ways of communication and computation. One application, cryptography, has already been demonstrated, and is close to being commercially exploited. Quantum cryptography cannot prevent a spy from trying to decode a secret transmission. But the spy's actions will irreversibly modify a secret quantum key sent from the sender to the receiver, providing cast-iron proof that an unwanted third party is listening in. As quantum information is so easy to disturb, transmitting entangled photons over useful distances is a considerable challenge. But the technology is making good progress. Last year, for example, Zeilinger's group performed the first real transfer of money from a bank using quantum cryptography. The possibilities of multiparticle entanglement are endless, Zeilinger says. Until now, entanglement experiments, such as the \u2018teleportation\u2019 of a complete quantum state from one particle to another, have used up to four particles (usually photons). If it were possible to \u2018connect\u2019 even more particles and maintain high-quality entanglement over greater distances, this may open up entire new worlds of quantum communication, he says. Zeilinger dreams of using satellites for quantum communication between any two spots on the globe. Although transmitting entangled photons on the ground is limited to distances of less than 20 kilometres, in space it is much easier. A feasibility study for supplying satellites with high-precision lasers to produce entangled photons and send them to Earth has already been made. Zeilinger hopes that the European Space Agency will fund a payload of such components to the International Space Station by 2010. The ultimate goal might be to connect a network of future quantum computers. Zeilinger's group has recently demonstrated the first one-way quantum computer, in which an entangled multi-photon state starts out with all of the possible calculation results, and proceeds by irreversible steps to reach the final answer (P. Walther  et al .  Nature   434 , 169\u2013176; 2005). But a future \u2018Internet\u2019 based on the laws of quantum physics is currently pure science fiction.

{"file_id": "4341062a", "url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/4341062a", "year": 2005, "authors": [{"name": "Geoff Brumfiel"}], "parsed_as_year": "2006_or_before", "body": "The intelligent-design movement is a small but growing force on US university campuses. For some it bridges the gap between science and faith, for others it goes beyond the pale. Geoff Brumfiel meets the movement's vanguard.  For a cold Tuesday night in March, the turnout is surprisingly good. Twenty or so fresh-faced college students are gathered together in a room in the student union at George Mason University in Fairfax, Virginia, the state's largest public university. They are there for the first meeting of Salvador Cordova's Intelligent Design and Evolution Awareness (IDEA) club. \u201cI have a great deal of respect for the scientific method,\u201d Cordova tells his attentive audience as he outlines the case for intelligent design. Broadly speaking, he says, the concept is that a divine hand has shaped the course of evolution. The arguments are familiar ones to both advocates and opponents of the idea: some biological systems are too complex, periodic explosions in the fossil record too large, and differences between species too great to be explained by natural selection alone. Cordova \u2014 who holds three degrees from the university, the most recent one in mathematics \u2014 argues that the development of life on Earth would be described better if an intelligent creator is added to the mix. Most scientists overwhelmingly reject the concept of intelligent design. \u201cTo me it doesn't deserve any attention, because it doesn't make any sense,\u201d says Bruce Alberts, a microbiologist and president of the National Academy of Sciences. \u201cIts proponents say that scientific knowledge is incomplete and that there's no way to bridge the gap except for an intelligent designer, which is sort of saying that science should stop trying to find explanations for things.\u201d But despite researchers' apparent lack of interest, or perhaps because of it, the movement is catching on among students on US university campuses. Much of the interest can be traced to US teenagers, more than three-quarters of whom believe, before they reach university, that God played some part in the origin of humans (see  graphic ). But others are drawn to the idea out of sheer curiosity. \u201cStudents are in the challenge-authority mode at that time in their life, and I think they're intrigued,\u201d says Stephen Meyer, director of the Center for Science and Culture at the Discovery Institute, the nation's largest intelligent-design think-tank in Seattle, Washington. Since the first IDEA club began at the University of California, San Diego, in 1999, more than 20 chapters have opened on college campuses around the country. In addition, a small number of academics have begun to offer courses on intelligent design (see  \u2018Cast out from class\u2019 ). \n               Relative unease \n             Darwinists are divided in their response to the idea's growing profile on campus (see  \u2018Natural divisions\u2019 ). Many feel that the very presence of intelligent design in universities is legitimizing the movement and eroding the public's perception of science. \u201cIntelligent-design advocates want to split open the public's understanding of science and convince people that you can call on the supernatural for a scientific explanation,\u201d warns Barbara Forrest, a philosopher at Southeastern Louisiana University in Hammond and co-author of  Creationism's Trojan Horse: The Wedge of Intelligent Design . But others feel that the movement deserves an airing at the university level, even if they oppose its teaching in public schools. \u201cI think that college is a place for experimentation,\u201d says Eugenie Scott, director of the National Center for Science Education, a group based in Oakland, California, that promotes the teaching of evolution in public schools. If intelligent design is gaining ground on college campuses, she adds, then scientists are as much to blame as anyone. \u201cI think college professors can do a better job of teaching evolution,\u201d she says. Back in the student union, Cordova is carefully pointing out what intelligent design can, and can't, do. The concept makes no attempts to verify the creation myth or other major biblical events, such as the flood, he says. Nor does it worry about whether Earth is a few thousand years old, as most creationists believe, or four-and-a-half billion years old, the current geological estimate. Intelligent design, Cordova notes, does not even attempt to prove the type of deity involved, it just points to some sort of supernatural intervention. In other words, he says: \u201cIntelligent design doesn't have any theology to it.\u201d  It is that distinction that has helped propel the small community of intelligent-design proponents to the forefront of US politics. In 1987, the US Supreme Court struck down a Louisiana law that mandated teaching \u2018creation science\u2019 in schools because the premise of the research was based on biblical texts. As intelligent design does not draw directly from biblical sources, Christian fundamentalist groups have seized on it as a possible way to force creationism back into the classroom. Last October, a school board in Dover, Pennsylvania,voted to include intelligent design in its local curriculum. And similar plans are now being considered in at least six states including Kansas, Mississippi and Arkansas. These plans include giving teachers new guidelines, and placing stickers on biology textbooks that question the scientific status of evolutionary theory. Intelligent-design advocates have mixed reactions to the Christian right's support of their work. On the one hand, the movement is largely dependent on funding from wealthy conservative philanthropists. That, according to Meyer, is why a 1999 funding document from the Discovery Institute argued that intelligent design had \u201creopened the case for a broadly theistic understanding of nature\u201d, and would eventually lay the groundwork for a series of debates and legal challenges over what should be taught in America's classrooms. Although Meyer is willing to promote such perceptions, he concedes that they can cause problems. For intelligent-design researchers who would like to see the concept peer-reviewed and accepted by the scientific community, the politics are frustrating, and potentially dangerous. The political goals associated with intelligent design lead many scientists to reject it outright as little more than creationism in a cheap tuxedo. \u201cSome of the policy proposals that have been made, for example the Dover case, are frankly, from our point of view, distracting,\u201d says Meyer. \u201cWe want to focus on intelligent design as an emerging research programme.\u201d Even considered on its research merits, scientists mostly agree that intelligent design rests on shaky foundations. For one thing, Alberts points out, the concept often makes its claims based on gaps in the current body of scientific knowledge. \u201cThe whole history of science is that these gaps are always filled,\u201d he says. For example, one common argument used by intelligent-design advocates is that the bacterial flagellum, a whirling tail that some bacteria use to move around, is too complex to be explained by evolution alone. \u201cI'm quite sure that within a decade or two we'll understand where it came from because we're sequencing more and more bacterial genomes,\u201d Alberts says. \u201cBut to give up now is totally ridiculous.\u201d \n               Crisis of faith \n             Perhaps surprisingly, many theologians are equally upset by intelligent design. \u201cThe basic problem that I have theologically is that God's activity in the world should be hidden,\u201d says George Murphy, a Lutheran theologian, PhD physicist, and author of  The Cosmos in the Light of the Cross . Murphy says Lutherans believe that God's primary revelation came through Jesus Christ, and many find it distasteful that additional divine fingerprints should appear in nature. Catholics, for their part, have accepted evolution based on the idea that God could still infuse the natural human form with a soul at some point in the distant past. And even the evangelical Christians who make up the backbone of intelligent design's political supporters sometimes object to its inability to prove whether Christianity is the true religion.  And yet the students listening to Cordova's lecture seem intrigued. Everyone in the room is Christian, and half are working towards degrees in science, medicine or engineering. It seems perfectly natural to them to mix science and faith. Many are also frustrated by the exclusively secular tone of their science classes, and to these students intelligent design offers an appealing alternative that puts God squarely back in the centre of things. Others, including Cordova himself, arrived at intelligent design from almost the opposite direction. Over a coffee earlier that day, he explains how intelligent design helped him resolve his own spiritual crisis five years ago. Since high school, Cordova had been a devout Christian, but as he studied science and engineering at George Mason, he found his faith was being eroded. \u201cThe critical thinking and precision of science began to really affect my ability to just believe something without any tangible evidence,\u201d he says. The breaking point came in 2000 when a woman from his Bible study group put her faith before her personal safety \u2014 travelling to Afghanistan as part of a covert Christian mission in a country that was, at the time, a militant Islamic theocracy. He felt unhappy accepting the promotion of such activities unless he could be sure Christianity was a true faith. \n               Scientific vacuum \n             So Cordova turned to his scientific training in the hope of finding answers. \u201cIf I could prove even one small part of my faith through purely scientific methods that would be highly satisfying intellectually,\u201d he says. He has since read a stack of books on cosmology and intelligent design, and has become a major advocate for the movement \u2014 representing the idea at public debates, challenging evolutionary theory in online chats and starting clubs at George Mason and several other Virginia colleges. Cordova's story is more common than many scientists might think, according to Keith Miller, a geologist at Kansas State University in Manhattan who is an evangelical Christian. \u201cI think a lot of students go through a period of being very conflicted about their faith, especially if they have an innate interest in science,\u201d Miller says. He knows a number of students who have fallen away from their beliefs as a result of their university experience. \u201cThey've so identified their faith with a particular view of what creation means, that it becomes an all-or-nothing kind of thing,\u201d he says. \u201cI do think intelligent design offers an alternative, although I would argue it's not a good one.\u201d But university lecturers are rarely able to offer students other alternatives that allow them to reconcile faith and science. Part of the problem has to do with time constraints, says Larry Rockwood, a population ecologist at George Mason. \u201cThe pressure is to work with the graduate students, do your research and teach your classes,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat's the reward for working with undergraduate student clubs? Not much.\u201d  More fundamentally, most lecturers are unsure of how to handle the concerns of deeply religious students, says Jo Handelsman, a plant pathologist at the University of Wisconsin at Madison. \u201cWhen I talk to these students individually I don't feel it's my place to replace what their families or churches have taught them,\u201d she says. \u201cThere's a lot of confusion about where the line is, and how much it's OK to offend your students.\u201d Scott, who is perhaps the nation's most high-profile Darwinist, is frustrated by the scientific community's inability to grapple with the issue. \u201cThe point here is that Americans don't want to be told that God had nothing to do with it,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd that's the way the intelligent-design people present evolution.\u201d Scientists need to do a better job of explaining that science makes no attempt to describe the supernatural and so has no inherent conflict with religion, she argues. \u201cCollege professors need to be very aware of how they talk about things such as purpose, chance, cause and design,\u201d she says. \u201cYou should still be sensitive to the kids in your class.\u201d Back at George Mason, Cordova is wrapping up his lecture, and planning his next steps for promoting intelligent design on campus. According to a survey he commissioned from the Campus Freethinkers \u2014 an atheist student group \u2014 75% of students would be interested in taking a course on intelligent design if it were offered. Cordova says he hopes the poll will help convince college administrators to offer such a course. \u201cI would love to see an intelligent-design class on one of these campuses,\u201d he says. \u201cI don't want to indoctrinate the students; I would just like them to get to know the theory.\u201d As for his personal future, Cordova adds that he would like to continue pursuing a career in science. Next year, he plans to apply to study cosmology at graduate school. \n                     IDEA clubs: \n                   \n                     Discovery Institute Center for Science and Culture \n                   \n                     National Center for Science Education \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

But have the risks and benefits been adequately assessed? Duncan Graham-Rowe investigates. Cardiologist Michael Sweeney has vivid memories of the day he inadvertently set off an explosion inside a 79-year-old man's chest. It was 2001, and the patient had come into the Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston for a routine check on his implantable cardioverter defibrillator, or ICD. Inserted under the pectoral muscles, an ICD can deliver a life-saving electric shock to a failing heart. But when Sweeney attempted to set off a test shock from the device, there was a blue flash from the patient's chest and a loud popping sound. A short circuit in his ICD had ruptured its titanium casing 1 . If the man hadn't been in hospital, says Sweeney, he almost certainly would have died. To be fair, this same device, the man's fourth, had previously restarted his failing heart several times. But the incident illustrates that having one of these potentially life-saving implants is not risk-free. Although such catastrophic electrical failures are mercifully rare, the surgery required to install, maintain and replace ICDs exposes patients to the danger of infection. And with the devices becoming increasingly popular, experts are now beginning to wonder whether \u2014 for some of the patients now receiving them \u2014 the risks might outweigh the benefits. \u201cAs defibrillators are being implanted in a larger number of people, the probability that each device will be required to save a person's life will go down,\u201d says Charles Swerdlow, a cardiologist at the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. Indeed, if your heart never actually fails, you will get all of the risks associated with having an ICD, and none of the benefits \u2014 apart, perhaps, from the peace of mind of knowing that the device is there, should you ever suffer a cardiac arrest. \n               Life saver \n             ICDs are extremely effective for people at high risk of heart failure. They apply shocks to the heart through conducting leads that are anchored within one of its chambers (see diagram). They can either act as pacemakers, providing small pulses to maintain the heart's rhythm, or deliver much more powerful jolts. The latter can resynchronize the contractions of the heart's muscle if it has entered a chaotic or dangerously fast rhythm, or restart the heart if it stops beating. Until recently, the only people who qualified for an ICD either suffered from potentially lethal abnormal heart rhythms, or had survived a previous cardiac arrest. But in recent years, official guidelines have extended their use to include many patients who are deemed likely to suffer heart failure. Over the past seven years, the number of people receiving ICDs in the United States has increased nearly fivefold. Overall, this trend is thought to be saving lives. Indeed, in the largest ever ICD trial, published in January and involving more than 2,500 patients, the devices reduced mortality by 23% in people with \u2018moderate\u2019 heart failure, compared with those who were treated with drugs alone 2 . On the basis of these results, the US Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services expanded its criteria for treatment with an ICD. According to the leading ICD manufacturer, Medtronic of Minneapolis, 1.6 million Americans are now eligible for the devices. That's about five times the number of patients who have so far received one. But some experts are sceptical of the need to give implants to so many patients. Most of the trials of ICDs, they note, are sponsored by the manufacturers of the devices \u2014 which have a vested interest in seeing them used more widely. \u201cI think inherently there is a conflict of interest,\u201d says Sweeney. \u201cThe companies are looking for a return on their investment.\u201d \n               Risk assessment \n             In particular, some cardiologists argue that more research should be done to distinguish between the patients at the highest risk of heart failure, and those who are unlikely ever to need a shock from an ICD. In the trial published earlier this year, for instance, only one in three of the devices delivered a shock over the five-year study 2 . \u201cProbably the large majority of those with ICDs will never have therapy,\u201d says Adrian Almquist, a cardiologist at the Minneapolis Heart Institute. Some cardiologists argue that a series of simple, non-invasive tests could be used to identify the patients at highest risk of cardiac arrest. Certain features of an electrocardiogram (ECG), for instance, may give a good indication of such risks. In the trial published in January this year, too few patients had been subjected to these tests for definitive conclusions to be drawn 2 . But in unpublished preliminary research, Morrison Hodges, also at the Minneapolis Heart Institute, has reanalysed ECG data from previous trials and found that they could give an improved risk assessment for individual patients. Hodges now wants to conduct a multicentre trial in which thousands of ICD patients would be monitored over several years, in order to refine his predictive model. He approached Medtronic to see if it wanted to get involved, but the company wasn't interested. That's hardly surprising, says Hodges: \u201cThese tests are better at identifying patients who don't need a defibrillator than those who do.\u201d On cost grounds alone, there are good reasons to think carefully about who should be implanted with an ICD. Each device costs about US$40,000, and every ICD patient requires lifelong care. The devices typically have to be replaced every five years or so, and they must regularly be monitored and serviced. Occasionally, parts such as the electrodes must be replaced. And each surgical intervention exposes the patient to the risk of infection. \u201cThis isn't like changing a part in your car,\u201d says Swerdlow. And then there is the risk of electrical failures. These can cause patients to receive a shock inappropriately or to fail to be shocked when they need to be. The explosion that nearly killed Sweeney's 79-year-old patient was an extreme case, admittedly \u2014 the coiled lead of his device had worn through its insulation. But cardiologists fear that similar incidents may become more common in future. \u201cThe problem is that devices are getting smaller and smaller,\u201d says Almquist. This will make it harder to separate and adequately insulate the high-voltage circuits in them, he argues. One worrying sign came in February, when Medtronic issued a warning that some of its Marquis model ICDs could develop a short circuit leading to the rapid discharge of the battery. The problem, a result of design changes made in miniaturization, would cause the device to emit an audible \u2018low battery\u2019 tone, or completely fail to work. \u201cWe changed the manufacturing process and that problem does not occur any more,\u201d says Marshall Stanton, the company's vice-president and medical director, cardiac rhythm management. Only nine such failures have been reported, he adds, and the company's tests suggest that no more than 1.5% of 87,000 implanted Marquis devices are prone to the problem. \n               Hidden failure \n             But the true incidence of ICD failure remains unknown. A 2001 attempt to evaluate the problem concluded that mechanisms for reporting are inadequate 3 . In the United States and many other countries, there is no legal obligation for doctors to report a device failure and no central independent database to collate this information, says Almquist, who co-authored the study. John Camm, a cardiologist at St George's Hospital in London, suspects that only about one in ten ICD failures are reported. \u201cIt is quite likely that there are dead patients whose devices failed,\u201d adds Sweeney. Under a different doctor, his 79-year-old patient could well have joined their number \u2014 Sweeney's clinic is unusual in that it runs checks in which patients are sedated and their devices are test-fired. \u201cYou have to turn over stones to find worms,\u201d he says. Given the uncertainties, Sweeney and other experts argue that it's time to start turning over stones in a more systematic manner. If current trends continue, says Sweeney, we may get to the point where guidelines recommend ICDs for almost everyone with a possible risk of cardiac arrest. \u201cAnd that is a very unsatisfactory position,\u201d he notes.

But those running clinical trials need to be on their guard, says David Cyranoski. In October 2003, China became the first country to move gene therapy into the medical mainstream, when it approved for general clinical use a treatment for head and neck squamous cancer. The feat was a symbol of the country's biomedical ambitions, and was lauded in the Chinese media. But just a few months later, a story emerged that revealed a grimmer aspect of China's rapid development in biomedicine. In January, four HIV-positive farmers from Henan province, representing a further 15, sent a letter of complaint to the US National Institutes of Health and the Chinese Ministry of Health. They had participated in a clinical trial for a drug called VGV-1, and claimed that informed-consent procedures had been neglected. The farmers are among hundreds of thousands of people in Henan infected with HIV by unhygienic commercial blood-donation practices during the 1990s. They say that they were not told about the risk of side effects from VGV-1, and are now consulting lawyers about a possible claim for compensation against Beijing's Ditan Hospital, which ran the trial \u2014 and possibly also against Viral Genetics of Azusa, California, the company that supplied the drug. The episode is a sign that China's clinical research is jumping ahead of its system for ethical oversight. As  Nature  discovered on a recent visit, awareness of ethical regulations and informed-consent procedures is alarmingly low \u2014 even among researchers and medical professionals. Some institutional review boards (IRBs), which are supposed to enforce ethical standards, do little more than rubber-stamp the proposals that come before them. Xiaomei Zhai, a bioethicist at Peking Union Medical College, and a member of several IRBs, admits that many boards need to be better trained. \u201cOtherwise we can't deal with the complicated problems that come up,\u201d she says. There's a great deal of work to be done if China's biomedical researchers are to retain their people's trust as they stride into the clinic with experimental treatments. In the meantime, Western organizations collaborating on clinical-research projects in China will need to take extreme care if they are to avoid getting their fingers burned like Viral Genetics. The company trusted its Chinese partners to deal with the regulatory and ethical aspects of the VGV-1 trial. Instead it has seen its name tarnished by the revelation that the project went ahead without approval from the State Food and Drug Administration (SFDA), which is supposed to check previous data to confirm that experimental drugs don't pose unacceptable hazards. \n               Land of opportunity \n             Despite the potential pitfalls, medical researchers are queuing up to work in China because of the plentiful clinical opportunities. Companies are also eyeing the long-term prospects of selling drugs into an emerging pharmaceuticals market. From rare genetic disorders, through obesity and other \u2018lifestyle\u2019 ailments, to a wide range of infectious diseases, China has one of the most complicated and debilitating disease profiles of any nation. In theory, regulations put in place in 1999 mean that clinical trials in China must abide by Good Clinical Practice, a set of international standards that demand informed consent, approval of trial protocols by independent IRBs and the appropriate regulatory authorities, plus strict monitoring of ongoing trials. But in practice, enforcement of these standards is patchy. And unlike Western regulations, the Chinese rules contain no detailed guidelines on procedures for recruiting volunteers and ensuring informed consent. \u201cWe need details on the possibility of damage to subjects and about compensation,\u201d says Yiming Shao, a virologist at the National Center for AIDS/STD Prevention and Control in Beijing, who advises the Chinese government on public-health issues. What's more, a few diseases are deemed sufficient threats to public health that even some of those who are trying to tighten China's ethical framework are prepared to continue cutting corners. HIV, which could infect 10 million Chinese in the coming decade, heads this emergency list. \u201cFor AIDS, we have to accept that we have to compromise,\u201d says Zhai. Such sentiments help explain how the VGV-1 trial fell into an ethical mire. VGV-1 consists of two proteins derived from calf thymus glands that, in lab tests, bind to an HIV protein called gp41. The idea is to prevent the virus from latching on to its target cells. A previous trial on ten patients in Mexico hinted that VGV-1 could restore the effectiveness of other AIDS drugs (J. J. Ayala-Gayt\u00e1n  et al .  HIV AIDS Rev.   3,  8\u201313; 2004). The Chinese trial was designed to study the drug's effects in patients who had received no other antiretroviral therapy. \n               Recruitment drive \n             Trial participants tell alarming stories of how they were recruited. Xiuping Li, a farmer from Henan, claims she was told that the series of injections would put her in good health for 20 years without further treatment. \u201cThey didn't say that there were risks,\u201d she claims. Jirong Pang, another participant from Henan, says he suffered a high fever and red flaky rash all over his body and face. Other patients had more severe reactions, alleges Li, and were forced to pay for additional medicine to treat them. Participants interviewed by  Nature  say they signed informed-consent forms that they could not understand and that doctors made no effort to explain. Their complaints go on: copies of the forms had to be paid for; expenses were not covered as agreed; participants weren't informed of the trial's results, despite asking. \u201cThat's common in China. Most doctors don't answer patients' questions,\u201d says Fei Zang, a former accountant from Beijing who volunteered for the trial. The patients' complaints were referred to the IRB of the National Center for AIDS/STD Prevention and Control. It recommended that, in future, doctors must make better efforts to explain trials to patients, and ruled that the 48 yuan (US$5.80) charged for informed-consent forms should be returned and that participants should be paid expenses at a rate of 10 yuan per day. But overall, the panel concluded that there were no \u201cserious problems\u201d with the trial \u2014 much to the disappointment and anger of the participants. Ruotao Wang, an epidemiologist at the Union School of Public Health in Beijing, who chairs the National Center for AIDS/STD Prevention and Control's IRB, explains that his remit didn't include the failure to get the drug approved for experimental use by the SFDA. \u201cThat's a serious problem,\u201d he says. The fact that the trial was approved by Ditan Hospital's IRB despite this omission underlines the inadequacy of the current framework for ethical oversight. Zhai says that her IRBs would never authorize a trial without SFDA approval \u2014 but she understands how it might happen elsewhere. \u201cA US company says it has medicine, and doctors say this is good news,\u201d Zhai says. On hearing this, inexperienced members of many Chinese IRBs may get carried away with enthusiasm. \u201cFew have formal training in bioethics,\u201d says Zhai. \u201cThey are mostly scientists.\u201d Matters aren't helped by the lack of any national IRB accreditation system. Wang's IRB is one of the best regarded in China. Yet even its meetings are an eye-opening experience for anyone familiar with international standards \u2014 as  Nature  found out by attending a lively session in March. The committee evaluated eight proposals for new trials, three of which \u2014 including one collaboration with a US institution \u2014 detailed few or no procedures for informed consent. With a mix of laughter and censure, Wang's IRB interrogated the researchers. One scientist, realizing that her trials with children would require parental approval, thought that this should be enough. \u201cShe wanted to know whether approval from the children was also necessary,\u201d says Wang. His committee sent that proposal back to the drawing board. Worryingly, such rulings may not have the desired effect of forcing researchers to adopt more rigorous ethical standards. \u201cIf we reject them, they often just go somewhere else,\u201d says Wang. \n               Paper trail \n             Procedures common in other countries, such as journal policies that stipulate ethical procedures, are also absent in China. \u201cMost journals in China give no consideration to ethical matters,\u201d says one editor, who is adding notices of informed-consent procedures to his journal pages in an attempt to raise awareness among potential authors. \u201cBut if we followed international practice seriously, we would receive very few papers,\u201d he says. Against this chaotic background, researchers from Western institutions can find themselves battling charges of impropriety even if they have satisfied international ethical requirements. David Ho, director of the Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center in New York, who is conducting a trial of a combination of antiretroviral drugs in Yunnan province, has come under attack for not getting provincial ethical backing \u2014 even though well-regarded IRBs in Beijing and the United States approved the protocol. \u201cSome people do not want us in China,\u201d claims Ho, who was born and raised in Taiwan. \u201cThey want to slow our programmes down because I am viewed as a foreigner.\u201d Viral Genetics, meanwhile, is still counting the cost of its foray into the wilds of Chinese clinical research. \u201cWe appreciate the fact that perception of the trial may be tainted because of a bureaucratic mistake,\u201d says Alan Sheinwald, who handles public relations for the company. \u201cBut we believe that the underlying ethical, medical and scientific practices are up to any scrutiny that has been or will be brought to bear.\u201d That assertion may yet be tested in a court of law. \n                     http://www.nature.com/uidfinder/10.1038/nbt1204-1497 \n                   \n                     http://www.nature.com/uidfinder/10.1038/nm1204-1283 \n                   \n                     http://www.nature.com/uidfinder/10.1038/419334a \n                   \n                     Chinese State Food and Drug Administration \n                   \n                     US National Institutes of Health bioethics resources \u2014 Human Subjects Research and IRBs \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Yet that's what Alison Abbott found on a recent trip to Iran. In December 1996, 20 students gathered in a small candle-lit room in the north of Tehran. There they vowed to devote themselves to the study of the brain and mind, sealing their pledge in a document signed with their own blood. In a country with no textbooks or journals in cognitive neuroscience \u2014 and no teachers in the subject \u2014 this solemn ceremony symbolized extraordinary commitment. At around the same time, Hossein Esteky abandoned a brief struggle to establish himself at the Tehran Medical School, where he had returned after completing a PhD in neurophysiology at the University of North Texas. He left for a two-year postdoc position at the RIKEN Brain Science Institute in Saitama, Japan, unsure if he'd ever be able to pursue his professional interests in his homeland. Today, against the odds, Esteky heads a cognitive-neuroscience research group in Tehran that is beginning to make its mark internationally. Many of the team are former members of the 1996 study group, known as Niloufar \u2014 the Farsi word for lotus flower, and the street where its inaugural ceremony took place. Western scientists who have paid a visit to Esteky's group are effusive in their praise. \u201cThe laboratory is a wonder,\u201d says Patrick Cavanagh, a vision researcher at Harvard University. Niloufar formed around a nucleus of three medical students, all coincidentally known as Arash, and each the product of the \u00e9lite high schools run by NODET, the National Organization for Development of Exceptional Talents. NODET's extracurricular workshops, remembers one of the trio, Arash Yazdanbakhsh, \u201cinstilled in us the spirit of experimentation\u201d. The three have since vindicated NODET's backing \u2014 and proved themselves worthy bearers of the name of an ancient Iranian hero. Iranian mythology tells of Arash the Archer, who accepted a challenge from the attacking armies of Turan in the north. Shooting from Mount Damavand, Iran's highest peak, the country's border would henceforth be drawn where Arash's arrow fell. The Turans hoped to confine the Iranians to a narrow strip of land. But when Arash shot his bow, he turned into pure energy, propelling the arrow 2,250 kilometres to the Oxus River in Central Asia. His three modern namesakes, working in a country devastated by the war with Iraq in the 1980s, and kept crippled by US-led sanctions, set to their neuroscience challenge with similar energy. Their first task was to expand the group, then locate suitable books to begin their studies. \n               Bookworms \n             Arash Fazl, a technical whiz, borrowed a computer in the Institute for Studies in Theoretical Physics and Mathematics (IPM), Iran's premier research centre, and set up a DOS-based Internet connection. The group used it to identify three books on cognitive neuroscience. NODET head Javad Ejei bought the texts for his prot\u00e9g\u00e9s during a trip abroad. The arrow was in the bow. As soon as their medical classes finished, Niloufar's members began their \u2018real\u2019 study, recalls Seyed Reza Afraz, who has been known as Arash since childhood, and today works in Esteky's group. \u201cWe divided the books among ourselves for efficiency,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd each of us taught the others what we learnt from them.\u201d To begin with, the going was tough. Afraz and his peers realized that they should have started with more fundamental textbooks. But within a year they were getting up to speed, and started to hanker after primary research papers. Scouring journal contents on the Internet, they wrote e-mails to researchers whose work sounded intriguing. Cavanagh and Irving Biederman, a cognitive neuroscientist at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles, were among the first to send their papers. \u201cI was really moved by the requests that came from young people wanting to get out of the dark,\u201d says Biederman. He and Cavanagh each began an intense scientific correspondence with the Niloufar group. The students devoured every word and began to do basic experiments in psychophysics. They subjected human volunteers to simple visual stimuli displayed on a computer monitor, and drew inferences about cognitive processes from their responses. The group's first results were published as an abstract submitted to a 1998 neuropsychology meeting in Montreal, Canada \u2014 which the Iranians could not afford to attend. By then, a spin-off study group had formed in Esfahan, an ancient city 400 km south of Tehran. \n               Meeting of minds \n             But it was back at the IPM where things really began to take off. One day in 1999, some Niloufar students were invited to work on a project with Abdolhossein Abbassian, an IPM mathematician who wanted to model the function of the thalamus, a key relay station for information in the brain. \u201cHe looked at us one evening,\u201d recalls Afraz, \u201cand said: \u2018I am a mathematician. To me, the thalamus is a black box with input and output. I want to see the real thing, and touch it\u2019.\u201d So Afraz and his friends dissected a lamb thalamus for him. They were rewarded with a take-away pizza, a luxury in Tehran. Having got a foothold in the IPM, the students began to haunt the place, borrowing computers and other facilities. It was a good time to get involved. Set up in 1989 to pursue Iranian strengths in theoretical physics, the IPM was trying to expand into experimental work. Esteky had returned from Japan in 1999 to take up a position at the Shaheed Beheshti University of Medical Sciences in Tehran. The IPM invited him to do some projects at the institute, where he and the Niloufar students immediately hit it off. \u201cWhen I got there, I found these eager students hanging around, and naturally we hooked up,\u201d Esteky says. Esteky invited those interested in his own field of visual perception to join his projects, and provided working space for others whose interests left them without a mentor in Iran. The austere corridors of the IPM were enlivened with music and chatter until after midnight, as the exuberant Niloufar gang combined partying and work. Even with such enthusiastic staff, it was hard for Esteky to establish his research. He wanted to continue the work he had been doing in Japan, trying to understand how monkeys categorize visual objects and recognize faces. Happily, Keiji Tanaka, vice-president of the RIKEN Brain Science Institute, donated electrophysiological equipment. But getting monkeys was a challenge. Esteky toured around the zoos in Iran, and eventually built up a colony of 12 macaques. Finding no commercial source of feed, he had to contract a local baker to make the required biscuits. \n               Fishy tale \n             A much-told story is of Esteky's first operation on the brain of a monkey, done with some students at one in the morning. The power failed after the skull was opened, and panic erupted. The building was new and the emergency lights didn't work. One of the students rushed for a tin of tuna. He inserted a makeshift wick into its oil and the monkey was looked after by tuna-oil lamp until power was restored. Today, Esteky heads the IPM School of Cognitive Neurosciences, and has a dozen PhD students, many from the Niloufar and Esfahan study groups. IPM funds have purchased additional infrastructure, including a visual neuroscience lab kitted out for about US$500,000. But the problems of working in a country gripped by US sanctions continue. It took four years for Esteky to get one piece of equipment for analysing neuronal recordings, made by a single American company. Some journals have made it difficult for Iranian scientists to publish. And visas for travel to the United States are hard to come by. Visitors are few \u2014 even though Esteky invites many foreign scientists. Those who have been bold enough to fly to Tehran have been impressed. Cavanagh was the first to visit, in 2002. Sightseeing plans were soon abandoned, as he was mobbed by students who kept him occupied with high-level discussions until he left. \u201cThey had enthusiasm, creativity and a scientific fervour that matched or even surpassed any other group I have visited,\u201d says Cavanagh. \u201cI left exhausted and inspired.\u201d Nancy Kanwisher, a specialist in visual perception at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, visited last year. \u201cI nearly wept when I understood what they were doing,\u201d she says. \u201cIt is cutting-edge science, addressing extremely hot questions, against formidable odds.\u201d She was particularly impressed by the female students, who were as ambitious as their male counterparts. Iran's religious leaders may be conservative in their attitudes to women, but such views don't prevail in the lab. Esteky's biggest concern is that his students' talent and ambition will drive many of them abroad. Each of the original Arash trio has already shot his arrow well beyond the borders of Iran. Yazdanbakhsh and Fazl are completing their PhDs at Boston University; Afraz will start his PhD with Cavanagh in September. Esteky won't pressurize anyone to stay, and says his job is to create the best possible working conditions so that returning is a viable proposition. As a student during the war with Iraq, he volunteered for medical duty and treated civilians who were victims of Saddam Hussein's chemical weapons. The experience made him determined to strive for peace, stability and scientific progress in Iran. Between the ninth and sixteenth centuries, he notes, Iran was a world leader in science: who says it can't one day be so again? \n                     http://www.nature.com/uidfinder/10.1038/427663a \n                   \n                     http://www.nature.com/uidfinder/10.1038/nm0204-109a \n                   \n                     IPM School of Cognitive Sciences \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},
{"file_id": "435012a", "url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/435012a", "year": 2005, "authors": [{"name": "Roxanne Khamsi"}], "parsed_as_year": "2006_or_before", "body": "Are wafers of silicon that support cells cultured from vital organs the future of drug testing and toxicology? Roxanne Khamsi talks to the pioneers creating model animals \u2014 and humans \u2014 on a chip. For Michael Shuler, downsizing is not a dirty word. In the mid-1990s, his lab bench was cluttered with flasks connected by surgical tubing. Each flask contained cells from a different organ, suspended in nourishing fluids. Shuler's goal was to model how chemicals entering the body can be metabolized into more toxic forms.  Today, the apparatus has been shrunk to a tiny device that looks like something from the insides of your mobile phone. Shuler's lab is tidier, and his chips are more adept at simulating the way in which minute quantities of fluid carry chemicals between cells in our bodies. They may also point toxicologists towards a more humane future \u2014 reducing the number of animals required to establish the safety of a drug or other chemical. \u201cWe're not using this to replace animal studies,\u201d Shuler stresses. \u201cWe're trying to have more intelligent use of animals.\u201d  Shuler, a chemical engineer at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, was converted to the chip-based approach in 1997, after Gregory Baxter arrived on the campus to take up a position developing nanofabrication technologies. \u201cWe got talking and saw that there were a lot of advantages of adapting the system to fit on a silicon chip,\u201d Shuler recalls. Within a year, the pair had created a prototype \u2018animal on a chip\u2019 \u2014 a postage-stamp-sized silicon wafer that held cells from a rat's brain, heart and liver in different trenches linked by tiny fluid channels. \n               Channel hopping \n             Since then, Shuler has continued to refine his chips 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 . The latest versions consist of two sheets of acrylic sandwiching a piece of silicon about 25 millimetres square containing fine custom-etched channels and troughs. The devices typically store around 100,000 liver cells, about 10,000 from another organ such as the lung, plus smaller numbers from tissues such as fat. \u201cWe can grow and keep cells on the chip for weeks,\u201d says Shuler. Liver cells are crucial because they are the body's workhorses for metabolizing drugs and other chemicals \u2014 in particular, they produce enzymes of the cytochrome P450 family, which oxidize a wide range of drugs. It is also important to mimic the way in which some chemicals are absorbed by the body's fat reserves \u2014 Shuler's team is experimenting with lipid gels 5  in addition to fat cells. Controlled by a micro-pump, pinkish fluid circulates from one chamber of cells to another. The nutrient liquid travels down channels about the size of a human hair, carrying drugs or other chemicals from one compartment to another. In these compartments, cells can cosy up to one another much as they would in a living tissue, bathed in small quantities of fluid in which biologically active molecules can exert much greater effects than they would swilling around in a flask. But Baxter and Shuler had to think carefully about the architecture of their chips, to simulate the ways in which cells are exposed to body fluids and dissolved chemicals in different organs. To mimic the rapid blood flow in the lung, for instance, the researchers initially made chambers containing multiple parallel channels. But this required more pressure, and disrupted the flow. So the researchers have since opted for larger chambers incorporating pillars on which lung cells can grow. Proof-of-concept studies have highlighted the chips' value. Typical lab tests on single cell types, for example, struggle to reveal the lung toxicity of naphthalene, the main ingredient in mothballs. But Shuler's chips have no problem: the liver cells convert naphthalene into its toxic product naphthoquinone, a reactive compound which can then move to the \u2018lung\u2019 compartment where it damages the lung cells 6 . \n               On the move \n             In 2001, Baxter left Cornell to commercialize the technology at H\u00b5rel in Beverly Hills, California, a company he co-founded. One of H\u00b5rel's studies has used the technology to demonstrate the known action of tegafur, an anticancer drug that must be converted into an active form by enzymes in the liver. As expected, the drug had no effect on its target \u2014 colon cancer cells \u2014 unless it first ran through the liver-cell compartment to get switched on. Shuler's group has now started using the chips to investigate multidrug-resistant cancer. Doctors have found that mixing medicines offers new hope for some patients, but the number of possible combinations is too great to be investigated in expensive clinical studies. With the chips, this is not a problem. \u201cWhat we hope to do is screen treatments for disease that would not be screenable with animal or human studies,\u201d says Shuler. An extra bit of tweaking has even enabled Shuler's team to mimic the blood\u2013brain barrier, which prevents many chemicals, including harmful ones, from entering the central nervous system. The endothelial cells that form this tight barrier quickly lose their special characteristics when cultured on their own. But by growing them alongside nerve-supporting cells called astrocytes on an ultrathin membrane, the researchers have managed to restore their protective function 7 . The Cornell devices can run experiments for a couple of days, but problems then arise as bubbles of air start to form in the fluid. To try and get round this difficulty, Shuichi Takayama, a biomedical engineer at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, is developing chips made from gas-permeable silicone gel. The trade-off is that the chips' contents slowly evaporate. The pattern of flow from one compartment to another in Shuler's devices is predetermined for each application by the custom-etched pattern of channels, but in the Michigan version the fluid can be moved in different ways on the same chip. Takayama's group also has an unusual and novel approach to steering the fluids around.  The idea came from Wei Gu, an undergraduate student in Takayama's lab, who happened to read about a device called a refreshable Braille display while browsing in the university library. This hardware features a moving arrangement of pins that converts text from a computer screen into a form the blind can read by touch. Gu realized that he could apply the grid of vertically moving pins to open and close the fine channels on the pliable silicone chip. Following computer controls, the system pinches off flow much like a person stepping on a water hose \u2014 doing away with the need for more intricate pumps and valves 8 . \u201cAlthough many labs are working on microfluidic pumps, valves and even complete organ subsystems, devices that can be integrated onto a chip and be remotely controlled by a computer are rare,\u201d says Takayama. \u201cOur goal is to not have to worry about microfluidics and worry about what to do with cells.\u201d So far, Takayama's team has been culturing just one cell type on the chips, and has also been using them for tasks such as separating healthy from non-motile sperm. But like Shuler and Baxter, he aims to incorporate cells from different tissues and organs. In addition to using samples from established cell lines for toxicological studies, Takayama and his colleagues plan to place undifferentiated stem cells on their chips. They then hope to mature these into nerve, bone and muscle cells, for example, by flowing the right signalling compounds through different paths, to study aspects of developmental biology. \n               Another dimension \n             Other researchers are trying to represent the three-dimensional structure of tissues more accurately, which can be important if cultured cells are to behave as they would in the body. Linda Griffith, a tissue engineer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, has focused her efforts on liver cells. At her lab in Cambridge, Massachusetts, researchers etch silicon to produce microscopic honeycomb-like scaffolds containing a multitude of channels and walls that cells can stick to 9 . These structures more accurately simulate the uptake of fluids in the liver, according to Griffith. H\u00b5rel might also experiment with similar chips in future. \u201cIt would be easy to modify the compartments to accommodate any three-dimensional tissue constructs,\u201d says Baxter. But for now, the company is concentrating on commercializing its current designs, the first of which could reach the market in about a year. Either animal or human cells can be put on the chips. Shuler and Baxter began to incorporate the latter into some of their chips back in 2000. Toxicologists and drug developers typically work with rats because they need a living system that roughly matches human physiology. But in the end, notes Robert Freedman, chief executive of H\u00b5rel, \u201ca rat liver is not a human liver\u201d. The new chips may not look much like rats or people. But if they can ensure that drugs reaching clinical trials have a better chance of being safe and effective than at present, they're likely to have a busy future. \n                     http://www.nature.com/uidfinder/10.1038/423010a \n                   \n                     http://www.nature.com/uidfinder/10.1038/418474a \n                   \n                     H\u00b5rel \n                   \n                     Cornell Nanobiotechnology Center \n                   \n                     Michael Shuler \n                   \n                     Shuichi Takayama Lab \n                   \n                     Linda Griffith \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Tony Reichhardt gets ready for a trip to the interior. Photographs of the martian surface are undeniably beautiful, but uncovering the truth behind the sinuous river beds and suggestive gullies is not easy. Spacecraft and rover missions have turned up plenty of evidence that water once flowed on Mars, but today the planet's surface is bone dry. There is water ice at the poles and hints of a frozen sea near the equator \u2014 but any large reservoirs of water are likely to be kilometres down where conditions are warmer. So the hunt for liquid water, which might provide a habitat for martian life, has gone underground. In the coming months, an instrument called MARSIS (Mars Advanced Radar for Subsurface and Ionospheric Sounding) on Europe's orbiting Mars Express spacecraft could supply some long-awaited answers. If it works as planned, it will be a kind of divining rod for Mars, and could pave the way for future radar projects. As with divining rods on Earth, the answers are likely to be ambiguous, and MARSIS may draw a blank. But for the moment, project scientists will be happy if it works at all. In April 2004, the MARSIS team had to delay starting up their radar, the last of seven instruments on Mars Express, after concerns that the antenna's two 20-metre-long fibreglass booms might whip around and damage the European Space Agency's (ESA) craft after their release. A team including experts from the Italian Space Agency and NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, who created the radar, ran computer simulations and ground tests to assess the risk. ESA went ahead with the deployment in early May, but a glitch as the first boom unfolded has resulted in more analysis and delay. Meanwhile, precious radar viewing time is being lost. As Roberto Seu, a MARSIS investigator at the University of Rome \u2018La Sapienza\u2019, admits: \u201cIt's been very, very frustrating.\u201d \n               Prime time \n             As the spacecraft's orbit shifts, the lighting and ionospheric conditions on Mars change, and the long wait has resulted in MARSIS missing much of its prime viewing window for this year. \u201cWe're very eager to get started,\u201d says Jeff Plaut, one of MARSIS's two principal investigators, who is based at the Jet Propulsion Lab in Pasadena, California. The radar scientists hope that Mars Express will be extended beyond its scheduled two-year mission, which would let the experiment continue early next year. Meanwhile, a project called SHARAD (Shallow Subsurface Radar) is being readied for launch on NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter in August. If these experiments prove successful, radars could be attached to rovers destined for the martian surface, and sent to study Jupiter's ice-covered moon Europa or the interior of an asteroid. Sounding radars such as MARSIS and SHARAD work by transmitting a radar pulse from orbit down to a planet, then analysing the signal that bounces back. Depending on the pulse frequency and the properties of the materials it strikes, the signal will penetrate a certain depth below the surface. In general, the lower its frequency, the deeper it will penetrate. Water ice is very transparent to radar. Dry soil can be too, depending on factors such as its electrical conductivity and porosity. Liquid water is a strong radar reflector. Tracking how much radar energy bounces back, how it's scattered, and how fast it moves through different patches of underground material can, with some coaxing, yield a rough map of subsurface geology. If all goes well, MARSIS will begin scanning the planet's northern hemisphere this year. The radar's low frequency (1.3\u20135.5 MHz) allows it to penetrate, in principle, down to 5 kilometres. But such low frequencies result in low resolution \u2014 between 5 and 10 kilometre horizontally, and about 100 metres vertically. Any reservoir of groundwater smaller than that will not show up. SHARAD's higher bandwidth and operating frequencies (15\u201325 MHz) mean that it won't penetrate as deep as MARSIS (about 1 kilometre), but it will have higher resolution \u2014 as little as 300 metres horizontally and 15 metres vertically. Data from the Mars Odyssey project suggest there is ice in the planet's shallow subsurface, which may be detected by SHARAD. \n               Broad spectrum \n             On Earth, geologists, engineers and archaeologists use portable ground-penetrating radar (GPR) units to hunt for everything from mineral deposits to buried artefacts. Mounted on aeroplanes, radars are also handy for exploring vast icy regions. They were used in 1996 to confirm the existence of Lake Vostok, a 10,000-square-kilometre reservoir hidden under 4 kilometres of ice in Antarctica. Elsewhere, high-frequency orbiting radars have been used to map the surfaces of cloud-covered worlds such as Venus and Saturn's moon Titan, which are hidden from ordinary telescopes. But these radars barely scratch the surface. The only body apart from Earth to be probed by a deep sounding radar is the Moon \u2014 the Apollo 17 spacecraft carried an antenna that penetrated more than a kilometre below the dry lunar dust in 1972. Roger Phillips, a geophysicist at Washington University in St Louis, Missouri, who worked on the Apollo experiment, recalls that interpreting the results was a nightmare. \u201cWe went into the Apollo thing pretty naively,\u201d he says. The radar data were full of echoes from surface features as well as underground rock layers, and real subsurface features got lost in the noise. It wasn't until they used stereo pictures of the surface taken from orbit that Phillips' team could factor out the radar echoes. And it was years before they were confident enough to publish their findings, which tentatively identified structures a kilometre down. Eliminating confusing radar echoes will still be a problem on Mars, says Phillips, now co-leader of the team that is building SHARAD. But the Mars investigators know much more about the topography of the planet than the Apollo investigators did about the Moon in 1972. Using elevation data from NASA's Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter and stereo pictures from the high-resolution camera on Mars Express \u2014 not to mention 33 years of improvements in computing power \u2014 they will be able to model the radar noise from surface features ahead of time. But we still do not know how well MARSIS and SHARAD will work in practice. On Earth, a geologist would survey the subsurface rocks before using a sounding radar by mapping the local outcrops and mineralogy. But the Mars radars will be peering into terra that is mostly incognita. That makes their chances of penetrating the martian crust unpredictable. Some minerals with high metal content are good radar reflectors, and could prevent the radars from probing deep enough to find water. Current models suggest that liquid water could exist 2\u20136 kilometres below the martian surface, but the radar signature for water is not unique, and other conductive materials, including certain clays and metallic minerals, could be mistaken for groundwater. Phillips believes that the search for water will be difficult. But that is not MARSIS's sole purpose. Mapping the base of the planet's thick northern ice cap would be valuable for planetary geologists, for example \u2014 as would any clear picture of the subsurface. \n               Interior designs \n             John Grant, a planetary geologist at the Smithsonian Center for Earth and Planetary Studies in Washington DC, thinks that MARSIS will work over some areas but not others. He hopes to land a small, mobile GPR on the planet in the future and proposed one for NASA's next rover mission, the Mars Science Laboratory. It wasn't picked, but a successful MARSIS experiment could boost his chances when the next opportunity arises. Grant's proposed GPR system would take very high-resolution (tens of centimetres) radar soundings to depths of 10\u201320 metres. When mounted on a rover, the device would take quick radar pulses of the subsurface at every place it stopped. Eventually it would build up a map of the geology underfoot. If tapping into water ice near the martian surface requires drilling, as most people think it will, radars could help future explorers pick the best site. Europa is also in the sights of the radar gang. It is an intriguing target for planetary scientists because of the ocean thought to underlie its icy crust. However, any radar built to penetrate the thick ice would have to operate in Jupiter's strong radiation environment. Even more exotic is a proposal from a team led by Erik Asphaug of the University of California, Santa Cruz, designed to probe the insides of an asteroid. The concept lost out in NASA's last competition for mid-sized planetary missions, but is likely to be submitted again. Earth-based radars have already been used to scan the outside of asteroids. Deep Interior, as it is called, would use a sounding radar in close orbit around an asteroid to take a three-dimensional image similar to a medical ultrasound. Combined with active experiments such as NASA's Deep Impact mission, which will blast an artificial crater in a comet this summer, it could provide the most complete picture of an asteroid yet. But for all its promise, sounding radar still suffers from a lack of respect, or perhaps awareness, among planetary scientists. It's a complicated technology, and interpreting the data is tricky. \u201cMost planetary scientists don't believe in radar,\u201d admits Seu. But MARSIS investigators are hoping that their experiment will soon change that. And all they really need is one Lake Vostok. \n                     www.nature.com/news/infocus/mars.html \n                   \n                     MARSIS: \n                   \n                     MARS EXPRESS: \n                   \n                     SHARAD: \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Mark Peplow follows the preparations for first light. The vast silver dome of the Gran Telescopio Canarias (GTC) glitters as the sun beats down on the volcanic peak of Roque de los Muchachos. Here on La Palma, one of the Spanish Canary Islands, construction continues apace. When it finally opens for business at the end of this year, the GTC will take the title of the world's largest optical telescope \u2014 an impressive symbol of how far Spanish astronomy has come in a remarkably short time.  The telescope is also a testament to the lifelong vision of one man, a man who has made it his life's work to establish world-class observatories in the Canaries and put Spain at the forefront of astronomy research. For ground-based telescopes, size and location are everything. When looking for dim and distant stars, the largest mirrors simply catch more photons, allowing astronomers to see farther and more clearly. With a mirror that is 10.4 metres wide, the GTC is unlikely to disappoint. And Los Muchachos is already home to 14 telescopes because, at 2,400 metres, its high altitude and cloudless weather reduce atmospheric distortion. Tramping between the telescopes is like touring a futuristic martian outpost. Gleaming white buildings rise out from the red volcanic rocks, and a short stroll in the thin air quickly leaves me breathless. A perfectly still layer of cloud hangs 1,000 metres below, covering the Atlantic Ocean in a white blanket broken only by neighbouring volcanic peaks. In 1856, the first astronomer to visit these islands, Charles Piazzi Smyth, the Astronomer Royal for Scotland, declared Tenerife to be ideal for astronomy. But another 100 years passed before the rector of the University of La Laguna in Tenerife asked a new physics graduate called Francisco S\u00e1nchez to make detailed tests of a potential telescope site close to Mount Teide on the island. \u201cI quickly realized two things,\u201d recalls S\u00e1nchez. \u201cThat I was very attracted to astronomy; and that the site was incredibly good.\u201d From that point onwards, he devoted his life to making best use of this natural resource. \n               Leading light \n             S\u00e1nchez is now director of the Canaries Institute of Astrophysics (IAC) in Tenerife, a post he has held since it was founded in 1975. When he began his investigations in the 1960s, there were four professional astronomers in Spain. Now there are more than 400, including 150 permanent research staff. Many of them credit S\u00e1nchez with single-handedly creating the vibrant research community from virtually nothing. \u201cI just felt it would be a great shame if the islands were used only to tan people,\u201d S\u00e1nchez says.  Although he now does little research, S\u00e1nchez commands great respect from his colleagues for the hard bargains he drives with politicians and international researchers. In person, S\u00e1nchez is genial, and speaks with the velvet-clad phrases of a consummate politician. \u201cHe's an autocrat, and he does get things wrong, but his right decisions wash away his sins,\u201d says John Beckman, a British astronomer who moved to the Canaries in 1984, and was the IAC's first research director. Once Teide and Los Muchachos were established as prime locations for telescopes, S\u00e1nchez spent six years in negotiations to ensure that whenever other nations wished to build observatories there, 20% of their observing time would be reserved for Spanish astronomers. Nineteen countries have telescopes in the Canaries, operated by more than 60 institutions worldwide. Part of the deal is that each country must also pay for several Spanish postdocs to work abroad each year. This was crucial in helping Spanish astronomy to come up to scratch so quickly, says Beckman. \n               Clear view \n             S\u00e1nchez says his ability to convince others stems from his own belief in the potential of the observatories. \u201cI'm just a pathological optimist,\u201d he smiles. His negotiating skills were also needed to convince the tourist industry, the Canaries' biggest money-spinner, to dim streetlights and neon signs. Legislation introduced in 1988 protects the observatories from light pollution, low-flying aircraft and air pollution. Public outreach activities have been essential to the observatories' progress, says S\u00e1nchez, who recently had a street named in his honour. Strong local support for the IAC resulted in the regional government of the Canaries, together with the Spanish government, providing 90% of the \u20ac100 million (US$128 million) funds for the GTC. Universities in Florida and Mexico have contributed the rest. Many astronomers, even in Spain, doubted whether the GTC would be built, says Jos\u00e9 Miguel Rodr\u00edguez Espinosa, who leads the GTC project and is president of the Spanish Astronomical Society. The largest optical telescope built by Spain before the GTC was just 80 centimetres wide. To convince funders that Los Muchachos was the perfect site for a giant telescope, IAC astrophysicist Casiana Mu\u00f1oz used atmospheric physics to model the air turbulence above La Palma. She says that the site is as good as Hawaii, home to the world's largest optical instruments currently in operation \u2014 the two 10-metre Keck telescopes. The GTC is almost a direct copy of the Kecks, and will also use adaptive-optic techniques to modify its mirrors to compensate for turbulence in the air above. This should deliver images that rival space telescopes such as Hubble, Mu\u00f1oz says proudly. The GTC will house several special instruments to extract maximum information from the photons it collects. The first few are all Spanish-built. One of the most versatile optical instruments is OSIRIS, which takes spectroscopic measurements that can reveal the chemical composition of a light source. Such detailed measurements usually focus on individual, bright objects, but OSIRIS is designed to survey many dim objects over large parts of the sky. This means that it can be used to catalogue the ages and compositions of stars in the farthest reaches of our Galaxy. Closer to home, OSIRIS will also focus on Kuiper-belt objects, frosty remnants from the formation of the Solar System that lie beyond the orbit of Neptune. Information about these primitive snowballs is limited to the largest and brightest objects, so OSIRIS should provide a more complete census. Another instrument, EMIR, offers similar advantages at the near-infrared end of the optical spectrum. One of its first goals will be to peer deep inside the thick dust clouds that shroud stellar nurseries and capture the birth of a star on film. Because visible light is blocked by the clouds, astronomers hope that infrared surveys will allow them to see inside. \n               Broad scope \n             These instruments will not be operational until the end of 2006. Although engineering work on the GTC's 300-tonne superstructure is now complete, the project is two years behind schedule and the inside is still a building site. Wandering through the empty dome, I had a chance encounter with Jean-Claude G\u00e9rard, an astronomer from the University of Li\u00e8ge in Belgium, accompanied by his wife. They had taken a break from their holiday on La Palma to get a sneak preview of the building. \u201cIt would be fantastic to be able to use it,\u201d G\u00e9rard says, admiring one of several hexagonal-mirror segments, each costing half-a-million dollars, that will soon be mounted on the telescope. G\u00e9rard may well get his wish \u2014 the GTC has proved to be a powerful bargaining chip for Spanish astronomers who want to join the European Southern Observatory (ESO), a consortium of 11 European nations that share facilities such as the Very Large Telescope in Chile. On 28 April at a meeting in Madrid, Spanish and ESO negotiators confirmed that Spain would become a full ESO partner in 2006. The deal gives Spain a 25% reduction in its \u20ac65-million entry fee in return for a steady supply of data from the GTC to other ESO scientists. \u201cI think it's a good deal for Spain,\u201d says Rodr\u00edguez, a key player in the talks. Spanish astronomers will keep 90% of the observing time on the telescope, but some of this will be earmarked for collaborative projects with ESO researchers. Similar deals operate at the Keck telescopes, for example, where 85% of the time is reserved for researchers from Hawaiian and Californian universities or their research partners. Rodr\u00edguez is unapologetic. \u201cIf you own the telescope, your community uses the telescope,\u201d he says firmly. But such comments reveal another side to the islands' success story, say several foreign researchers working there. \u201cThere is a degree of nationalism here that can be good and bad,\u201d says Mark Kidger, a British astronomer who moved to the Canaries with Beckman in the 1980s, and still has a contract position there. \u201cIt can be a great driving force, but there's also a reluctance in some areas to accept help from outside.\u201d \n               Closed shop \n             Because permanent research positions in Spain are regarded as civil-service jobs, Spanish applicants tend to be favoured. Those with foreign qualifications must undergo an expensive accreditation process, lasting several years, before they can apply to take the formal examinations required for an appointment. This bureaucracy will ultimately hinder Spanish astronomy's development, argues Kidger.  For example, the Armenian astronomer Garik Israelian, a rising star at the IAC, has been encouraged to take up Spanish citizenship to help with his career. \u201cI have many Armenian colleagues who are professors in Britain and the United States who have had none of these problems,\u201d says Israelian. Still, he is keen to battle through the red tape. \u201cI've had much better collaborations here because people are much more open to working together,\u201d he says. Stories like Israelian's are not unusual. Nepotism is all too common, says Chris Benn, a British astronomer who works at the Isaac Newton Group of Telescopes on La Palma. Astronomy in Spain is \u201cmuch more about having friends in the right places\u201d, he notes. Spanish astronomers accept that there are problems, but insist the climate is changing. \u201cIndividualism has been the rule for many years in Spain, but now we're making large-scale collaborations with international partners,\u201d says Rafael Rebolo, one of the IAC's senior researchers. The IAC now requires students with new PhDs to spend at least two years working abroad before they return to the Canaries. \u201cIt gives a clear sign that these students must spend part of their career elsewhere,\u201d says Rebolo.  \u201cMost Spanish astronomers agree that it would be good to open things up,\u201d says Johan Knapen, a Dutch astronomer at the University of Hertfordshire, UK, who worked with Beckman in the Canaries. \u201cBut they don't want to if it means they won't get the jobs themselves.\u201d Finding jobs for returning postdocs is one of the biggest problems facing Spanish astronomy, says Artemio Herrero Dav\u00f3, head of research at the IAC. He is pushing for more government funding for junior positions. \u201cOtherwise, young people will be discouraged and Spanish astronomy will lose its momentum,\u201d he says. But most Spanish astronomers are positive about the future. In a global survey of astronomical research, Benn and his colleague Sebastian S\u00e1nchez (no relation to Francisco) found that Spain now produces just under 5% of all astronomy papers, which is comparable to the output from Japan and the Netherlands (S. F. S\u00e1nchez and C. R. Benn  Astron. Nachr.   325,  445\u2013450; 2004). European countries with a longer tradition in astronomy, such as Germany, France and Britain, produce about 10% each. \n               Treasure island \n             \u201cThe Spanish have made a decision to put a lot of money into astronomy, and it's growing faster than in any other country,\u201d says Benn. But much of that money has gone to the IAC, which some say has caused a bitter rivalry between the Canaries and astronomers on the mainland. Rafael Bachiller, director of the Spanish National Astronomical Observatory (OAN) in Madrid, disputes this. \u201cWhat happens in the Canaries is good for astronomy everywhere,\u201d he insists. \u201cAbout 20 or 30 years ago, when optical and infrared astronomy were moving to the Canaries, the OAN decided to focus on radio astronomy,\u201d he says, adding that the two institutions now have complementary rather than competing interests. Bachiller is especially proud of the OAN's new 40-metre radio telescope at Yebes in central Spain, which he calls \u201can equivalent in radio waves to the GTC\u201d. The telescope was inaugurated in April, and will study the very first galaxies that evolved in the Universe.  Both the GTC and the 40-metre radio telescope are remarkable, says Bachiller, for being almost entirely Spanish-built. \u201cUntil now, we have been very good at using the telescopes that other countries put on our lands,\u201d says Bachiller, \u201cbut Spain has now developed the techniques needed to build its own facilities.\u201d With the GTC close to completion and his legacy assured, Francisco S\u00e1nchez is expected to retire by the end of the decade. So will Spanish astronomy survive without his guiding hand? Many of his colleagues fall into a whisper as they explain that it's not possible to imagine astronomy without him. \u201cI can't think of any single astronomer who could take over from S\u00e1nchez,\u201d says Israelian. Others point out that he was an ideal leader during the 1970s, when funding was secured by charming a politician over a glass of wine. But now that research funding is far more structured, S\u00e1nchez's political skills are less essential for the IAC to flourish, they say. Although S\u00e1nchez is cagey about naming his potential successors, Rebolo and Beckman are clearly front-runners. But for now, S\u00e1nchez is looking forward to returning to research after decades away from a telescope. \u201cI'm going to become directly involved with research again on the GTC,\u201d he says, adding that he is particularly interested in studying planets outside our Solar System and understanding galactic structure. \u201cI believe I've got the right to enjoy it,\u201d he laughs. \n                     Canaries Institute of Astrophysics: \n                   \n                     EMIR instrument: \n                   \n                     OSIRIS Instrument: \n                   \n                     ESO: \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

I'm Sally O'Reilly, a freelance journalist based in Washington DC. I've been researching a book on pandemic preparedness. But now the time for preparation has run out. \n               \u2022 26 December 2005 It's an emergency \u2014 official \n             President George Bush has just addressed the press in the East Room of the White House. Here's the transcript: \u201cAt this hour, the  World Health Organization  has declared a full-scale pandemic influenza alert, with person-to-person spread lasting more than two weeks in Cambodia and Vietnam. During previous influenza pandemics in the United States, large numbers of people were ill, sought medical care, were hospitalized and died. On my orders, the  Department of Homeland Security  and the  Department of Health and Human Services  have today implemented the nation's draft  Pandemic Influenza Response and Preparedness Plan . It will serve as our road map, on how we as a nation, and as a member of the global health community, respond to the pandemic. We are ready. Thank you, and may God bless America.\u201d Ready, my ass! I've reported on avian flu for almost a decade. The first thing I did on hearing Bush's address was to get on my cellphone to my husband, Jonathan. I told him to pack some bags and get ready to take the kids to my mother's house in Florida. \u201cRemember all that stuff I told you about how a bird flu pandemic might hit the United States? Well, I think it's about to happen.\u201d \n               \u2022 28 December 2005 Journey to the source \n             Hanoi, Vietnam. I'm exhausted, and I can still taste the disinfectant they sprayed inside the  Doctors Without Borders  plane. I'm at the Bach Mai Hospital. It was here, three weeks ago, that what they're calling the \u2018Hanoi index case\u2019 fell sick. A Malaysian on business, he was transferred to a hospital in Hong Kong, where he died. Samples sent to labs in the WHO Global Influenza Surveillance Network showed he was infected with an H5N1 avian flu virus, but one that differed from earlier isolates. It had mutated. But he won't have been the first patient with this mutated strain. As early as October there were hundreds of human H5N1 cases in the countryside south of here, but only a handful got picked up. Most went unnoticed by health authorities. Surveillance for human cases of flu in Vietnam has been patchy, and DNA diagnostic tests unreliable. WHO calls for more international funding were ignored. Now the virus has had three months to spread, pick up mutations and get better and better at jumping between humans. What's weirdest is that there weren't any declared outbreaks of bird flu in chickens here recently. Farmers weren't exactly queuing up to declare cases, though. There'd been talk of setting up a global fund to help them cope with eradicating avian flu, to compensate them for lost trade. But it came to nothing. Then again, perhaps the virus came from ducks, which can be infected without showing symptoms. \n               \u2022 29 December 2005 Life behind the mask \n             Today, I hooked up with the 15-person international team from the WHO's  Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network . They're like the cast in that movie  Outbreak , about some monkey virus. We've got epidemiologists from the CDC \u2014 the US  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  \u2014 along with mathematical modellers from Imperial and Emory, and virus hunters from the Pasteur Institute in Paris and the Robert Koch Institute in Germany. They're here to help hospitals control infection, and strengthen surveillance for human cases. Another team is doing the same in Cambodia. Across the world, health authorities are ramping up surveillance, trying to spot and isolate any exported cases as quickly as possible. They've grounded all commercial flights to and from the region. The chaos is way worse than with SARS. Second evening here. The N95 face masks, which the WHO has advised us to wear, are the worst part. Your glasses steam up and you feel half-suffocated. I only take mine off to eat and drink. The team has a web video conference via a high-bandwidth satellite connection with WHO headquarters in Geneva. Its Department of Communicable Disease Surveillance and Response is coordinating the international response. Poor guys, there's just a handful of them. They run through the latest stats. Here we go: 1,800 cases in Cambodia, 1,100 in Vietnam. Uh, oh ... six suspect cases in Tokyo and Johannesburg. So much for the flight bans. Overall, the mortality rate is 9%. That's nasty \u2014 worse than 1918. But it'll come down, as there's probably loads of asymptomatic cases. The labs have finished sequencing the virus and we now have a template for an H5N1 vaccine. But it won't be ready for months. So for now, the WHO is trying a long shot, known as targeted antiviral prophylaxis. Basically, the idea is to blanket bomb all index cases, their households and people in the immediate vicinities with antiviral drugs such as Tamiflu. Computer models predict that if we do this, we might just stop the pandemic in its tracks. But there hasn't been enough modelling, and now we're doing the experiment for real. Continued modelling will be vital, though, to work out how to deploy the limited supplies of Tamiflu we've got, and how long we need to treat people for the drug to work. Geneva informs us that the WHO international stockpile contains just 120,000 pills. WHO officials have been on the phone today with countries that have national stockpiles. The politicians know that stopping the pandemic at source would be the best solution. But they're reluctant to donate drugs, as they'll have less for their own citizens if this approach fails. No point asking the United States \u2014 they've only got enough pills for 1% of the population. Britain and France have enough for a quarter of their populations. Will they spare us any? Will they hell. \n               \u2022 30 December 2005 Getting to know the enemy \n             Geneva announces that the latest epidemiological studies say that the virus seems to have a \u2018basic reproductive number\u2019, or  R 0 , of between 1.4 and 2.0. This means that one case on average infects only one or two people. So if we can detect cases quickly and treat them and their contacts, the models suggest we could contain the virus most of the time. At the least, that might slow the pandemic and corral it in that region for a few months. That would win time to get a vaccine. But we know there is a very short window. As time goes by, this virus will get better and better at transmitting between humans, and the  R 0  will increase. If it goes above 3, there's no way we'll contain it. The latest news from Cambodia cheers us up. There's a slowdown in new cases. Control efforts seem to be keeping the lid on the virus there. But here it's a different story: the team is having difficulties finding and isolating contacts of patients in this crowded city. This flu moves much faster than SARS because its incubation period is just two days. People are spreading the virus the day before they get sick, and asymptomatic patients without even being visibly ill. Tamiflu needs to be administered within two days of anyone showing symptoms. As I wandered through the streets this afternoon, it wasn't looking good. People are walking around Hanoi coughing and spluttering. They've closed the schools, which is the right thing to do, but what are all the kids doing? Hanging out downtown enjoying the unexpected holiday. \n               \u2022 31 December 2005 Six months to a vaccine! \n             Vaccine teleconference. There are 125 people \u2014 companies, regulators, scientists \u2014 hooked in, each with their own agenda. It's impossible. There's a lot of talk on whether the six-month delay before there is any vaccine can be shortened. Scientists had been working on methods of growing virus for the vaccine in large vats of cultured animal cells instead of eggs. That could cut the delay to maybe three months. But progress had been held up by US  Food and Drug Administration  concerns over the safety of the cell lines. In any case, it would probably take at least two years before the existing factories could be switched over. So we're stuck with eggs. A fast-track FDA approval for an H5N1 vaccine is under way. Fortunately, the US Department of Health and Human Services last year funded Sanofi-Pasteur to test a \u2018mock\u2019 H5N1 vaccine, using antigens from an earlier strain. So we don't need to start the approval procedure from scratch for the pandemic strain. We've gained some time. But US production capacity \u2014 one factory \u2014 is only enough to cover up to 90 million people. The situation is better in the European Union: it can probably produce enough to cover 30% of its 450 million people. The predictable news is that every vaccine-producing nation has just nationalized its supply to serve its own citizens first. The \u2018have-not\u2019 countries aren't going to get any vaccine. There's a lot of hindsight and recrimination at this meeting. The United States only tested vaccines at standard doses. Testing a vaccine containing an immune-boosting adjuvant might have allowed it to be diluted eightfold. Even with existing world production capacity, that would have let us produce 7.2 billion shots, enough to treat half the world's population. Now it's too late. \n               \u2022 25 January 2006 Escaping from hell \n             Apologies for the long delay in posting. The past few weeks have been chaos. I was out with WHO teams from dawn to dusk as they tried in vain to stamp out the outbreak with drugs. People fell sick all over Hanoi and 1 in 50 of them died. Many of the worst affected felt fine in the morning, but were dead by lunchtime \u2014 blue in the face, gasping for air. At the overcrowded hospital, I saw victims collapsing, suffocating in their own lung fluid, blood streaming from their noses and gums. Others had longer ordeals, tortured by encephalitis as the virus ate into their brains, or overwhelmed by multiple organ failure. Panicky authorities transported corpses out to the fields by truck and burnt them on open pyres. In a desperate last attempt to quell the outbreak, the WHO took what drugs it had left here and blindly treated whole sections of the city where transmission was most severe. The army was supposed to enforce quarantine, but many of them were sick as well, or had joined the exodus from the city. The fleeing people inevitably spread the disease to the countryside. In a few days' time, the Vietnamese are supposed to celebrate Tet, the lunar new year festival. It's traditional to eat chicken \u2014 but not this year. My plane leaves tonight. I feel like I'm escaping from hell. \n               \u2022 2 February 2006 The virus spreads \n             Today, I was at a press conference at the  National Institutes of Health  in Bethesda. A guy from the CDC pointed to a giant screen, a map of the world dotted with red pixels. He said that they'd reckoned the virus might hit in two or more waves up to eight months apart, as in past epidemics. They'd hoped the first pandemic strain of H5N1 might be poorly contagious, and come back again with a vengeance after it had picked up more infectivity. By that time we might have had a vaccine. That was just a hunch, though. And it was wrong. The mild pandemic in 1968 took almost a year to cross the globe. This one probably started around October. So we're now almost four months in. Look at that map! With the huge increase in passengers travelling by air, it's already lodged in 38 cities around the globe. The outline of Asia is barely visible beneath the swarm of red pixels. Now the virus is in coastal cities on both sides of South America. It hit Europe two weeks ago, ripping through Paris in just 11 days. In the French capital alone, there were 2.5 million cases and 50,000 dead. That's par for the course \u2014 infection rate 25% and mortality 2%, similar to the 1918 pandemic. Extrapolate these numbers, and we're going to have over 30 million dead worldwide. In poor and densely populated countries like India, it could be worse. Where's next, I asked. Based on passenger data \u2014 which had to be prised from the airlines \u2014 one epidemiologist was willing to make a guess. \u201cWithin two weeks, there.\u201d He traced his finger from San Diego to Los Angeles, up to San Francisco. Within another three to four weeks, it'll be the turn of the conurbations along the eastern seaboard. \n               \u2022 18 February 2006 This can't be happening \n             The United States is battened down before the storm. The government has outlawed all gatherings in public places. In past pandemics that never worked. But epidemiologists say that if we do it early on, it might slow the spread. Modelling also suggests that closing schools and universities is especially important as teenagers and young adults are among the worst hit. We just need to stop them from hanging out elsewhere. Stay at home, is the message blaring from every TV screen.

And I can't believe there's no vaccine. This can't be happening in America.\u201d \n               \u2022 20 February 2006 America shuts down \n             The  Commissioned Corps of the US Public Health Service , the nation's uniformed force of health professionals, has just been mobilized. The  US Northern Command  is in charge of the military response. Soldiers are setting up triage centres, anticipating overflowing emergency rooms and morgues. Images are coming in of tent cities being erected in New York's Central Park. Wards are being installed in schools and churches. Troops are on the streets. \u201cThere's going to be civil unrest,\u201d a general informed me on the phone this morning. The CDC is in charge of national influenza surveillance, but it's a nightmare now. This is the peak season for ordinary flu, sparking false alarms and panic. Scant supplies of Tamiflu are being reserved for medical first responders, and essential services. (Stocking cash machines is an essential service, we learn.) There's a lot of looting going on in pharmacies, but to no avail. The drugs are being distributed in convoys, with military jeeps in front and behind. Masks costing a dollar are being sold on street corners for $20. E-mailed ads for counterfeit drugs are filling up my inbox. \n               \u2022 27 February 2006 Everyone for themselves \n             I watch the scenes of a society descending into chaos from the relative security of my mother's isolated home. Red tail lights snake to the horizon as people pour out of the cities. Half the doctors haven't turned up for work; many are either ill, or caring for loved ones. Who should get the few mechanical respirators that can mean the difference between life and death? The youngest, or those with the best chances of pulling through? \u201cOur leadership must be prepared to make calculated decisions that will force raw prioritization of life-saving resources,\u201d explains a colonel on CNN. \n               \u2022 17 MAY 2006 The dust settles \n             The pandemic was declared over today. H5N1 will be back next year, or before that, as it replaces the existing seasonal flu strains. But by then, those who have recovered from this bout will have immunity, and we will have a vaccine. Pandemics move faster than governments or international bureaucracies, and the cost is hundreds of billions of dollars more than it would have been had we tackled avian flu in Asia in the first place, and invested in flu research. For millions of families, the cost isn't measured in dollars. Watching all that military hardware on the streets made me think. We imagined we could encourage pharmaceutical companies to develop innovative vaccines and drugs by offering \u2018incentives\u2019 or modest subsidies. When the military knows it needs a fighter aircraft, it doesn't offer incentives to Lockheed Martin or Boeing. It pays them through procurement to develop the weapon to the specifications it wants.

So the emerging field of regenerative medicine is now wrestling with the ecological concept of the niche. Kendall Powell reports. Linheng Li is learning to think like an ecologist. His study subjects put down roots near sources of nourishment and depend on other living things in their environment to thrive. But Li doesn't have mud on his boots. The \u2018species\u2019 he studies are stem cells and the \u2018ecosystem\u2019 is bone marrow. Within the anatomical forest of the marrow, Li's stem cells occupy specific niches \u2014 a term borrowed from ecology. An organism's ecological niche is a definition of where it lives, what it does, and how it interacts with its environment. Alter that environment, and the consequences for the organism can be dire. Conversely, if you take an organism and deposit it in an alien ecosystem, all hell can break loose. At the Stowers Institute for Medical Research in Kansas City, Missouri, Li thinks in a similar way about stem cells. For example, in aplastic anaemia, stem cells are unable to produce sufficient blood cells, even though they look normal. Something about the cells' microenvironment in the bone marrow may be awry, argues Li. \u201cIt's like the soil being damaged,\u201d he says. Similarly, just as an introduced species can run amok in its new environment, stem cells placed in the wrong tissue in the body might conceivably form a malignant tumour. Clearly, you can't hope to understand a woodland flower's niche in the forest by examining a specimen grown in a pot. And biologists are realizing that they are missing an important part of the picture by studying stem cells in Petri dishes. \u201cThinking of stem cells in isolation can be productive,\u201d says David Scadden, co-director of the Harvard Stem Cell Institute in Boston. \u201cBut it falsely simplifies what is a single component of a much larger, more complex system.\u201d Indeed, this jungle of stem cells, support cells, protein scaffolds, blood vessels and biochemicals may be every bit as complex as a forest ecosystem. And teasing apart the \u2018ecological\u2019 interactions involved may be crucial if stem cells are to fulfil their therapeutic promise, and eventually be deployed to grow specialized cells and tissues to replace those lost to injury or disease. So far, scientists have begun to define stem-cell niches for just a handful of tissues. Li's and Scadden's groups, for example, have partially defined the niche of blood-forming haematopoietic stem cells in bone marrow. Biologists suspect that the signalling pathways that help to define different stem-cell niches share common characteristics. But the details are likely to vary from tissue to tissue. \n               No place like bone \n             Researchers working with haematopoietic stem cells first proposed that the cells responded to their microenvironment almost four decades ago 1 . \u201cThey realized there was something special in the bone marrow \u2014 that it was an idyllic hideaway where stem cells could live for ever. As they leave the region, they are doomed to differentiate,\u201d says Haifan Lin, a stem-cell researcher at Duke University Medical Center in Durham, North Carolina. But at that time, biologists lacked the molecular tools to reveal why bone marrow is a safe haven for its stem cells. They needed cell-surface markers that would distinguish stem cells from the other cell types present. And without gene knockout technologies, they were unable to eliminate components of the bone marrow environment to find out which ones were crucial for stem-cell survival. When such tools appeared in the 1990s, they were first applied to a simpler system, in which it is easier to track the fates of individual cells. The gonads of fruitflies contain germline stem cells that give rise to sperm or eggs. These stem cells are held in sharply defined microenvironments, surrounded by just a few cellular neighbours. Around the turn of the millennium, two research groups showed that a tight pocket of support cells physically holds on to the stem cells, lining them up to divide properly. The oriented divisions ensure that one daughter cell remains in this pocket, where it receives specific biochemical signals that maintain its \u2018stemness\u2019 2 , 3 . The other is pushed out to start moving down the developmental pathway that gives rise to sperm or eggs. \u201cThe stem cells may just be following along, not really calling the shots,\u201d suggests Allan Spradling, director of the Carnegie Institution's Department of Embryology in Baltimore, Maryland. If the germline stem cells are removed, other cells \u2014 including those that have begun to differentiate \u2014 move in to take their place 4 . Similar dynamics can operate in ecosystems, if one species is wiped out. In their pioneering papers 2 , 3 , Spradling's team and the second group, led by Margaret Fuller of Stanford University in California, equated the term \u2018niche\u2019 with the microenvironment in which stem cells sit. Others have followed this convention. But from a strict ecological perspective, this is a misnomer \u2014 it's more of a nook, than a niche. In ecology, a niche describes a living thing's specific interaction with its environment, more like a job description than an address. Regardless of the way in which the terminology is used, it's becoming clear that \u2018ecological\u2019 interactions are central to stem-cell biology. \u201cThe fly research has laid the groundwork,\u201d says Leanne Jones, formerly a postdoc with Fuller, now running her own lab at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in La Jolla, California. The next challenge is to tease apart the ways in which the various types of stem cells found in adult mammalian tissues interact with their microenvironments. The best-studied mammalian adult stem cells are in skin, intestine, bone marrow and a few specialized regions of the brain where new neurons form. In each case, specific support cells seem to hold stem cells in place, and help to direct the production of daughter cells that differentiate to form specialized cells and tissues. In the bone marrow, for instance, Li and Scadden have shown that cells called osteoblasts lining the inner bone surface are closely associated with haematopoietic stem cells, encouraging their division and regulating their subsequent differentiation into the precursors of blood cells 5 , 6 . In a brain region called the hippocampus, neural stem cells take their cues both from cells called astrocytes and from the endothelial cells that line blood vessels 7 , 8 . Generally speaking, it seems that endothelial cells encourage stem cells to stay put and renew themselves 8 , whereas astrocytes say \u2018become a neuron\u2019 7 . Researchers are now trying to tease apart the biochemical signalling going on between adult stem cells and their support cells. It seems that these often involve the same molecular pathways that direct tissue generation during embryonic development \u2014 such as the Wnt, Notch and TGF-\u03b2/BMP pathways familiar to cellular developmental biologists. \u201cMaybe a stem cell is like the embryonic stage and is still able to respond to at least one of these pathways,\u201d says Li. In some cases, stem cells are physically anchored to their support cells; here, biochemical signalling may require physical contact between cell-surface receptors. For instance, osteoblasts bear a membrane protein called jagged 1, which fits into and activates a receptor called Notch carried on the surface of haematopoietic stem cells. This stimulates the Notch pathway, which encourages the stem cells to keep dividing to renew themselves 6 . \n               Location, location, location \n             In other tissues, such as the skin, support cells have a looser association with their stem cells. And in many cases, cellular communication is by diffusible biochemicals. The blood supply is also an important part of the microenvironment \u2014 many stem cells have blood vessels nearby, which may alert them to the physiological state of the whole organism. Some stem cells, such as those in bone marrow, can even migrate into blood vessels, circulate around the body, and return home when needed. Thinking like an ecologist can help when trying to understand such complex behaviour. Neural stem cells, for instance, stay put in the hippocampus, but their relationship with blood vessels may be every bit as important as the relationship of plants with streams and rivers. \u201cSitting right up next to a blood vessel versus just being nearby may make a huge difference to a stem cell,\u201d says Fred Gage, whose lab at the Salk Institute has led the way in characterizing neural stem-cell niches. Gage's group has also found that mammalian neural stem cells are not such passive players in their microenvironment as the fruitfly germline stem cells studied by Spradling and Fuller. Andrew Wurmser, a postdoc in Gage's lab, has found that neural stem cells can, under certain conditions, give rise to endothelial cells 9 . This hints that, if the need arises, they may be able to populate their microenvironment with the support cells that they need to thrive. Researchers led by Elaine Fuchs of Rockefeller University in New York have added further weight to the idea that some stem cells can create their own microenvironments. She has isolated individual epithelial stem cells, which give rise to skin and hair, and cultured them in the lab. When she subsequently grafted cells from these cultures into the skin of mutant hairless mice, they gave rise to hair follicles containing stem cells and support cells 10 . The nude mice grew tufts of hair. Many researchers want to work out whether adult stem cells can be induced to widen their horizons from their usual niche, and give rise to different cells and tissues. The idea that some stem cells can \u2018transdifferentiate\u2019 in this way has been hugely controversial, with many early findings now dismissed as artefacts. \u201cIf you put a haematopoietic stem cell into a neural stem-cell niche, does it become a neural stem cell, or will it respond differently? We still don't know,\u201d says Wurmser. Transdifferentiation remains an important question. For some diseases that might, in theory, be treated using stem cells, no appropriate natural stem cell has yet been identified \u2014 type 1 diabetes, where the pancreas loses its insulin-secreting \u03b2-cells, is the best-known example. Many researchers wonder whether an improved understanding of stem-cell microenvironments will provide clues about how to send stem cells down different developmental pathways, or reactivate quiescent stem cells. Perhaps a haematopoietic stem cell will give rise to a \u03b2-cell if placed in a pancreas-like environment. Maybe one day it will even be possible to devise niche-altering drugs. \n               Niche market \n             Some clinicians want to use adult stem cells to repair patients' failing bodies. Even if they don't need to invoke transdifferentiation, they may benefit from adopting an ecological mind-set. For some treatments, it may first be necessary to greatly expand stem-cell numbers by culturing them in the lab. Will the cells need to be grown in a realistic microenvironment to maintain their \u2018stemness\u2019, or will a simple bath of chemicals do? Some researchers argue that providing an appropriate three-dimensional environment in which signals come from the right direction will matter as much as using the right biochemicals. The same may go for getting stem cells to give rise to the appropriate tissues. \u201cYou do need an organized environment,\u201d argues Jones. Of course, many stem-cell biologists are working with embryonic stem cells, rather than adult stem cells. Found in blastocysts \u2014 embryos consisting of a hollow ball of cells \u2014 embryonic stem cells have the potential to give rise to all of the body's tissues. They don't live in such complex microenvironments as their adult counterparts, but the new wave of ecological thinking may still help to bring embryonic stem cells into the clinic. \u201cJust injecting embryonic stem cells is probably not the way to go,\u201d says Fuchs. \u201cLeft to their own devices, they do their own thing and go in different directions.\u201d Instead, most researchers working with embryonic stem cells are trying to get them to differentiate into specific cell types in the lab. But to unlock the cells' potential fully, biologists may need to find ways to recapitulate the changing microenvironments that characterize the long journey from embryonic stem cell to adult tissue. With an ecosystem as complex as the human body, attempting to recreate the precarious balances found in nature is no small task. To find the optimal conditions for stimulating stem cells therapeutically, biologists will need to know how stem cells and their neighbours depend on one another for survival. And they must test how far a system's equilibrium can be pushed before stem cells are wiped out or turn cancerous. The parallels with the local species extinctions and population explosions that can occur if a natural ecosystem is disturbed are clear. Many stem-cell biologists have already made their travel plans for next month's meeting of the International Society for Stem Cell Research in San Francisco. Perhaps some should put another date in their diary: the Ecological Society of America meets in Montreal, Canada, from 7 to 12 August. \n                     http://www.nature.com/uidfinder/10.1038/434694a \n                   \n                     http://www.nature.com/uidfinder/10.1038/nm0504-445 \n                   \n                     Stem cell Insight \n                   \n                     Stem cell In Focus \n                   \n                     NIH stem cell information \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

But quarrels over money, science and politics mean it could come too late, says Erika Check. On a Tuesday afternoon in early April, a young woman with intense green eyes sits in a hospital examining room in Rochester, New York. Pressing a ball of cotton into the crook of her elbow, she explains why she has just allowed a nurse to draw two and a half teaspoons of blood from her slender arm, even though she hates needles. Oksana, 29, is testing a vaccine that could save humanity from bird flu. \u201cEach of us has to do something to stop it \u2014 as much as we can,\u201d she says. Oksana \u2014 who asked  Nature  not to use her real name \u2014 has volunteered for a trial to test a vaccine against the H5N1 avian influenza virus. The study, funded by the US National Institutes of Health (NIH), includes 450 volunteers like Oksana. But their efforts could go to waste unless health officials, world leaders, scientists and businesses find fast answers to a mass of difficult issues. Money troubles, politics and hiccups in production processes could stymie the development of a vaccine to protect us from a flu pandemic. Vaccination against the common varieties of influenza that have been infecting people for years is nothing new. In 2003, drug companies sold some 292 million doses of the seasonal flu shot 1 . But a pandemic strain that has crossed over from birds will be so different from common flu that that the immune response created by our run-of-the-mill vaccines will be useless. A dangerous avian flu virus such as the H5N1 strain could morph into a pandemic virus in two ways. The virus could mutate so that it can be passed between people, or it could exchange genes with a common human flu strain (see  \u2018Deadly combinations\u2019 ). Once a pandemic strain is born, researchers will find themselves in a frantic race to create a vaccine that is effective against it. But that could take months \u2014 and in the meantime, a pandemic virus could circle the globe. So scientists are now gearing up to test human vaccines against H5N1 and H9N2, the two most threatening strains of avian flu. If a pandemic strain evolves from either of these viruses, it may not be an exact match for the vaccines we are testing now. But hopefully it will look similar enough for the vaccine to provide some protection. At least ten such trials are scheduled this year across Australia, Canada, France, Germany and Japan. Thailand and Vietnam are drawing up plans for trials, and the United States has already begun its studies with Oksana and her fellow volunteers. This is welcome news. Just seven months ago, Klaus St\u00f6hr, the chief influenza expert at the World Health Organization (WHO), warned that the world was asleep at the wheel. Back then, only two countries had plans to test a human vaccine against avian flu, and the WHO called a meeting of vaccine makers and government officials to sound the alarm. \u201cThere is currently too little momentum in the development of pandemic influenza vaccines,\u201d St\u00f6hr said at the meeting, held in Geneva. \u201cWe had three pandemics in the last century, and there is no reason to believe there won't be one in this century.\u201d \n               A shot in the arm \n             Results from earlier, small trials of H9N2 vaccines suggest that the human immune system might respond well to an avian flu vaccine only if it gets an extra kick from an ingredient called an adjuvant 2 , 3 , 4 . Adjuvants are chemical additives that seem to \u2018irritate\u2019 the immune system, dramatically boosting the response to a vaccine. But most countries have not approved the use of adjuvants in flu vaccines, so they need to undergo additional testing \u2014 and that will take extra time. The US government has said that it will pay for tests of an H5N1 vaccine boosted by an adjuvant. But for now, the vaccine trial in which Oksana is enrolled \u2014 which doesn't include an adjuvant \u2014 is the only game in town. To make a flu shot, scientists usually inject flu viruses into fertilized chicken eggs, let the viruses copy themselves, and then kill them with chemicals. But before this step, researchers have to modify the viruses so that they grow well in eggs. Traditionally, researchers have done this by infecting eggs with two different flu strains: a \u2018wild\u2019 virus, which causes illness, and a lab virus, which grows well in eggs. If everything goes according to plan, the two viruses mix their genes and reassemble into a vaccine strain that works against the wild flu virus. But this takes time and luck \u2014 and if your luck is out, vaccine production can be delayed by months. Today, it is possible to save time by using a technique called reverse genetics, perfected for flu viruses just five years ago 5 . This involves stitching flu-virus genes into loops of DNA called plasmids. The plasmids can assemble into whole flu viruses in the lab. By using reverse genetics, scientists can create exactly the types of virus they need, avoiding the lottery of natural reassortment. Researchers have already used reverse genetics to create candidate vaccines against H5N1 flu 6 , 7 . Each flu virus is named after the types of two proteins that make up its outer coat (see Graphic, below) \u2014 haemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N). The genes for these proteins are constantly mutating and come in many different varieties. To make their H5N1 vaccines, the researchers first altered the haemagglutinin gene from an H5N1 strain to make it less deadly, and then applied reverse genetics to create their mix-and-match vaccine strains. Oksana's trial is testing one of these vaccines, developed by a team at the St Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee. At the NIH, meanwhile, researchers led by Kanta Subbarao and Brian Murphy are creating a library of vaccines against a range of different avian flu strains, including H5N1 and H9N2. Unlike conventional flu vaccines, these would contain live, weakened viruses in a nasal spray, instead of dead viruses in a shot. The researchers hope that this will generate a stronger immune response. \n               Back to square one \n             But if a pandemic strain is vastly different from the vaccine strains that have already been tested, scientists will have to make a new vaccine from scratch. The St Jude researchers say that they could make a vaccine strain just four weeks after they get their hands on a sample of the pandemic strain 8 . But there's a problem: reverse genetics has been patented, so companies that make the vaccine would have to pay royalties to the patent holders. Companies are reluctant to do this, but scientists working in the field say that industry is trying to hammer out this issue now. Even if the intellectual-property issues are resolved, it will be very difficult to step up global vaccine production to make enough to halt a pandemic. Vaccine companies currently make 300 million flu shots a year. But in a pandemic, we could need billions of doses. So why haven't vaccine makers leapt to fill this gap? The answer is money. Flu vaccines are simply not a lucrative prospect for drug companies, which can make much higher profits on blockbuster drugs. And vaccines are risky: anything injected into a healthy person can end up doing more harm than good, leading to costly lawsuits and bad press. What's more, a flu pandemic might never hit, so business leaders are reluctant to spend money on new factories that might never be used. So at present, vaccine manufacturers have limited production capacity, which could be further constrained by the supply of lab-standard fertilized chicken eggs. Growing the virus in huge metal fermenters containing a soup of cultured cells could be faster than using eggs. But retooling entire factories is an expensive business. \u201cWe are talking about a totally unpredictable, very rare event, so it's difficult to commit a company to these preparational approaches,\u201d says Norbert Hehme, who manages GlaxoSmithKline's vaccine facility in Dresden, Germany. Governments could help to coax drug companies back into the flu-vaccine business by increasing the use of shots against common, non-pandemic flu. The Canadian province of Ontario, for example, gives standard flu shots to its entire population each year. And last August, the US government added flu shots to the list of vaccines recommended for all infants. These sorts of steps are reassuring companies that someone will buy their products. Bruce Gellin, head of the National Vaccine Program Office at the US Department of Health and Human Services, says that more companies are discussing the possibility of making pandemic vaccines. \u201cThe fact that manufacturers are interested says that it's a much more attractive marketplace now,\u201d he says. But as companies follow the money, some countries will be left behind. In 2003, nine rich nations, led by Japan and the United States, used 62% of the world's influenza vaccines 1 . But bird flu is most rampant in poorer countries that do not buy a lot of flu shots. Although Vietnam and Thailand are planning clinical trials of influenza vaccines, the plans are preliminary. So there is a high risk that the countries at ground zero will be defenceless in the early days of a pandemic. That would be a tragedy for the countries concerned \u2014 and could threaten us all. If rich nations lock down their vaccine supplies and watch pandemic flu rage through southeast Asia, they will hasten its spread across the globe. Public-health experts say that governments should pledge now to share their vaccine supplies. But no formal talks have been scheduled. \u201cSome ideas exist on how to organize sharing, but the reality is that no country with a vaccine producer has come forward with a proposal,\u201d says St\u00f6hr. Experts say that we must tackle these problems soon \u2014 before it's too late. In Washington DC last month, Michael Osterholm of the University of Minnesota spelled out the issues to a room full of experts gathered by the US Institute of Medicine. \u201cAfter the pandemic occurs, there will be a post-9/11-like commission,\u201d Osterholm said, referring to the high-level US panel that investigated preparedness against the 2001 terrorist attacks. \u201cAnd many scientists will be held accountable to that commission for what we did or didn't do to prevent a pandemic.\u201d The same will be true for government officials and business leaders who control our ability to deploy an effective pandemic vaccine. \n                     Race for pandemic flu vaccine rife with hurdles \n                   \n                     WHO calls for vaccine boost to prepare for flu pandemic \n                   \n                     'Reverse genetics' could offer forward-thinking flu vaccine \n                   \n                     Avian flu raises vaccine questions \n                   \n                     Avian flu web focus \n                   \n                     Bird flu in focus \n                   \n                     FDA flu vaccine information \n                   \n                     NIH H5N1 vaccine Q&A \n                   \n                     NIH flu vaccine library project \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

But global stockpiles are too small, and the countries at most immediate risk are among the worst prepared. Alison Abbott reports. The pharmaceutical company Roche didn't have huge commercial expectations for its influenza drug oseltamivir when it was licensed under the brand name Tamiflu in 1999. Flu is a fact of life, and doctors have been advising aspirin, hot lemon and bed-rest for generations. In most countries they continue to do so, reserving the drug for vulnerable groups such as the elderly. But in the past year or so, Roche has quadrupled its Tamiflu production capacity. The reason: developed countries are now stockpiling the drug against the threat of a pandemic flu virus that could arise at any time. Given the difficulty of rapidly producing an effective vaccine (see  page 404 ), drugs will be the first line of defence. But even after Roche's moves to boost Tamiflu production, experts say that global stockpiles are woefully inadequate. What's more, no one knows for sure the answers to several key questions. How many deaths could antiviral drugs prevent? To what extent would they slow the spread of a pandemic? Could they, as some mathematical modellers claim, even stamp out the disease as it emerges? \u201cThere is a lot of uncertainty, but that is no reason not to plan their use,\u201d says Marc Lipsitch, an infectious-disease epidemiologist at the Harvard School of Public Health in Boston. \n               Home guard \n             Although the pandemic will be global, defence plans are so far strictly national. Thanks mostly to prodding by the World Health Organization (WHO), about 50 countries have drawn up pandemic-preparedness plans. Most are still very sketchy, but include strategies for stockpiling antiviral drugs. Only a handful of nations, including Britain and Canada \u2014 but notably not the United States \u2014 have given their plans legal status. Worryingly, the list of relatively well-prepared nations includes few of those countries in Asia where a pandemic strain is most likely to emerge. Historically, the WHO has found it hard to persuade even rich countries to produce a pandemic plan: many governments have proved reluctant to pay for a stock of drugs that may not be used during their terms of office. Only now that the alarm bells are ringing about the H5N1 avian flu virus have official minds been focused. Experts agree that Tamiflu is the best of the four currently available anti-influenza drugs. A course costs between US$10 and $30, but national stockpilers have negotiated prices in the lower range. Roche is also making the powdered active ingredient available at a cheaper price than tablets. The powder would be dissolved in water and drunk when needed \u2014 nasty-tasting but still effective, and stable in solution for several days. Tamiflu, and the chemically related zanamivir, marketed by GlaxoSmithKline as Relenza, belong to a class of drugs called neuraminidase inhibitors. They do not eliminate the virus, but they reduce its release from infected cells by blocking a key viral enzyme. If taken within 48 hours of the onset of symptoms \u2014 the earlier, the better \u2014 they reduce the duration of symptoms by at least a day 1 , 2 . They also limit the severity of symptoms in non-pandemic flu: patients succumb less frequently to acute bronchitis or pneumonia 1 . That should be good news if the same applies to a pandemic strain, as patients who cough less will spread the virus less effectively. Relenza is less helpful because it has to be taken by inhaler, which is not very practical if a patient's breathing is impaired. But both neuraminidase inhibitors have so far generated few problems with drug resistance: mutations in the flu virus that confer resistance seem rare, and generally seem to weaken it 3 . (But an H5N1 virus sample from one Vietnamese patient has recently been shown to be less susceptible to Tamiflu, so experts are not complacent.) Side effects are also mild, and the drugs can be kept on the shelf for at least ten years without losing their activity. The older, off-patent drugs amantadine and rimantadine belong to a different class and interfere with a viral protein called M2, which stops the virus from entering its target cells. They seem to be as clinically effective as the neuraminidase inhibitors, but resistance arises very rapidly and the drugs can have disturbing side effects, including psychotic episodes. Although such reactions are rare, they would be highly unwelcome in the already panicky atmosphere of a flu pandemic. \n               Fair treatment? \n             Indeed, the potential for social unrest is a major concern for those laying pandemic plans. And demand for Tamiflu could exacerbate the problem. Who will, and who will not, be treated with this scarce but valuable resource? \u201cIt's not easy \u2014 we know there won't be enough for everyone,\u201d says Theresa Tam of the Public Health Agency of Canada. Britain, which is among the best-prepared countries, has ordered enough for about 25% of its population; Canada has stocks for just over 5% of its people; the United States currently cannot even cover 1%. In practice, a significant proportion of supplies might be used for prophylaxis of health-care workers \u2014 for up to two months as the influenza wave passes through \u2014 leaving less for treating the sick. \u201cIt is not a happy situation,\u201d says Klaus St\u00f6hr, the WHO's chief influenza expert. Canada, wary of the potential for a public backlash if health workers were perceived to be saving their own skins, included an ethicist on its Pandemic Influenza Committee. The WHO recommends that antiviral drugs should be available for the early treatment and prophylaxis of \u201cthose groups at highest risk of infection\u201d and \u201cessential workers\u201d. But defining these people, and matching their number to the doses available, is difficult. Ultimately, how you define your strategy depends on what you want to achieve, says clinical virologist Fred Hayden of the University of Virginia in Charlottesville. Most countries are aiming to keep the death toll as low as possible, but for others, maintaining the economy may be at least as high a priority. So the definition of essential workers will vary. Those deemed non-essential will be able to do little but don a protective face mask \u2014 which provides no guarantee of safety (see  \u2018Masking our ignorance\u2019 ). But the biggest challenge to any plan is the intrinsic biological uncertainty: just how nasty will a pandemic virus be? \u201cWe have so many unknowns \u2014 about how many people of what age groups would get ill, just how ill they would get, just how fast the virus would transmit \u2014 so it is hard to be firm about the best strategy for prioritizing treatment groups,\u201d Hayden says. Of course, the larger the stockpiles, the easier the choices will be. This is why the WHO is using all its persuasive powers to get governments to place orders now. Once a pandemic breaks out, it will be too late. Roche has promised not to profiteer by hiking prices during a pandemic, but it is not simply a question of money. The firm has no spare production capacity and batches take up to a year to make. In addition to encouraging stockpiling, experts are trying to find other ways of driving up the supply of antiviral drugs. They argue strongly, for example, for the wider prescription of antivirals against non-pandemic influenza. \u201cThis would allow companies to increase their routine manufacturing capacity without fear of losing money,\u201d says St\u00f6hr. Other countries should follow the example of Japan, which consumes three-quarters of the Tamiflu prescribed each year, he argues. Most of the rest is used in the United States, with only 3% being prescribed in the rest of the world. \u201cIt would be very good for physicians in these other countries to have experience with the drug before a pandemic arrives, so that they learn how best to treat patients,\u201d agrees Hayden. It's important for patients to be hit with the drug early, he says, but doctors may accept this only through clinical experience. The wider use of antivirals during annual flu epidemics would also stimulate companies to develop new drugs. This is currently not a priority for the pharmaceutical industry because the market is too small. \n               Unknown quantity \n             There is still of plenty of work to be done to further our understanding of Tamiflu's pharmacology. \u201cThere are gaps in our knowledge that we need to fill so that physicians can use it more effectively in a pandemic,\u201d says Hayden. For example, Tamiflu is not licensed for infants under one year old, because of the ethical difficulties of running trials in very young children \u2014 yet this age group proved exceptionally vulnerable in the severe pandemic of 1918. Pharmacologists also want more biological data on patients who are treated with Tamiflu after being infected with the H5N1 virus now circulating in Asia. This will help them optimize dosing regimes. They complain that not enough is being done to gather these data from the relatively few patients who have so far been given the drug. Animal studies would also help, but this has similarly not yet been made an official priority. Animal models could be used to investigate the use of Tamiflu in drug combinations, which may help avoid any problems with resistance. Pandemic planners are considering stockpiling amantadine and rimantadine as back-ups, despite their disadvantages, because they are cheap and were shown to have some prophylactic activity in the milder 1968 pandemic 4 . Now is the time to begin investigating the merits of using both major classes of anti-flu drugs together, says Hayden. Finally, experts urge that the few new candidate drugs coming up should be given serious consideration, even if they don't seem ideal. For example, peramivir, another neuraminidase inhibitor was developed by BioCryst Pharmaceuticals of Birmingham, Alabama, but abandoned because it has to be injected. Nevertheless, its very long half-life in the body means that it needs to be given only once or twice a week and so might be useful prophylactically. For most developing countries, meanwhile, creating a national stockpile would simply break the bank. So some public-health experts are calling for an international supply of Tamiflu that could be deployed by the WHO when a pandemic threatens. In unpublished work, Ira Longini, a biostatistician at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia, has calculated that about 120,000 courses of Tamiflu, if deployed rapidly to treat the sick and protect their families \u2014 and if combined with strict quarantine of their houses \u2014 could even nip a pandemic in the bud at its point of origin. St\u00f6hr thinks the idea of ring-fencing outbreaks in this way is \u201cwell worth investigating\u201d. But Longini's model depends on assumptions about transmissibility and initial death rate that may prove to be wrong. And given the poor infrastructure in many of the Asian countries in which a pandemic virus is most likely to arise, such measures might prove hard to implement in practice. Before embarking on an effort to persuade sceptical governments to invest in such a plan, says St\u00f6hr, there has to be much more confidence in the possibility that it could be made to work. Uncertainty, unfortunately, is the name of the pandemic flu game. And the problem, for those trying to work out how to organize the first line of defence, is that politicians are averse to spending large sums of money when they don't know the odds \u2014 or even whether they'll still be in post when the bet comes in. \n                     Bureaucracy stymies flu tactics \n                   \n                     Fear of human pandemic grows as bird flu sweeps through Asia \n                   \n                     Competition between flu drugs feverishly anticipated \n                   \n                     Avian flu web focus \n                   \n                     Bird flu in focus \n                   \n                     Tamiflu information \n                   \n                     Draft US antivirals strategy \n                   \n                     FDA influenza drug information \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

But biologists are realizing that this horrifying condition could shed light on more common problems. Claire Ainsworth reports. In a consulting room in Santa Barbara, California, Michael Salsbury found himself comforting his weeping doctor. It was July 2000, and he and his wife Gabriella were worried about their baby daughter, Gracie-Sophia, who was having seizures and losing her ability to stay alert and feed. The doctor had examined her and confirmed the Salsburys' worst fears: Gracie's brain was vanishing, and he couldn't tell them why. The doctor's tears were born of frustration and despair. Gracie was not the first of the Salsburys' children to succumb to this mysterious illness. Two other girls had perished before their first birthdays from a strange, incurable disease that robbed them of mobility and caused parts of their brains to melt away. None of their doctors had seen anything like it, and for years, the Salsburys were unable to get a full diagnosis. Now, thanks in part to their fortitude in donating their daughters' organs for research, the Salsburys have an answer. And it seems that the inherited disease that claimed Gracie and her sisters has implications far beyond the realm of rare neurological disorders. The faulty genes involved help control a vital aspect of our biology: the translation of RNA into protein. Biologists are realizing that documenting how this control can break down should help us to understand more about common diseases such as cancer and Alzheimer's \u2014 and may one day provide new ways to treat them. For the Salsburys, finally getting a proper diagnosis for their lost children has helped them to heal. \u201cWe went as low as any family can probably get, three times,\u201d says Michael. \u201cNow we finally know what took the lives of our daughters.\u201d The Salsburys' troubles began in 1993, after the birth of their second child, Stephanie. At three months, she began to have subtle epileptic seizures. Her condition soon deteriorated, while doctors ran every possible test and tried different combinations of drugs. \u201cShe was getting everything around the clock,\u201d says Gabriella, who works as an intensive-care nurse for newborn babies. \u201cIt didn't help.\u201d Stephanie died aged eight months. \n               No answers \n             Gabriella gave birth to another daughter, Jennifer, in 1995. At first, Jennifer was alert and lively. But at three months, she began to develop the same ominous symptoms. This time, knowing that nothing could be done, the Salsburys refused most medical tests. \u201cWe had been through the wringer with Stephanie,\u201d says Michael. \u201cWe wanted to keep our baby at home and comfortable, and love her for as long as we could.\u201d  Shortly afterwards, Michael, a banker, was transferred to Switzerland, where they had a healthy daughter, and then Gracie-Sophia was born. This time, Gabriella sensed that something was wrong before the symptoms began. Swiss doctors dismissed her fears, and the family planned a baptismal celebration back home in Santa Barbara. But as the plane touched down, Gabriella saw that Gracie was having subtle seizures. \u201cAnd so it became a funeral again,\u201d says Michael. After Gracie died, the Salsburys abandoned plans for a bigger family. Believing their daughters were the only known cases of the illness, they donated the girls' organs to research and hoped that someone would find an answer. But the Salsburys were not alone. From the early 1990s, several doctors around the world had been reporting bewildering cases of ailing or comatose children who had unusual brain scans 1 . Raphael Schiffmann, a child neurologist at the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke in Bethesda, Maryland, was the first to describe and put a name to the disorder: CACH, for childhood ataxia with central hypomyelination 2 . At the Free University Medical Center in Amsterdam, neurologist Marjo van der Knaap was also seeing similar cases. The children, normally less than five years old, would initially seem normal. Then, following a bang on the head, fever or even a fright, they would begin to lose muscle coordination. In some cases, the subsequent decline came in episodes and took years. But in others, it was frighteningly rapid. \u201cOn, say, Thursday, a child is unwell \u2014 starting to have a fever or a little bit of a cold,\u201d explains van der Knaap. \u201cThen on Friday, the child becomes irritable and limp, lies on the couch and doesn't do much. By Sunday, the child is in a coma.\u201d  Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans showed that the white matter in the patients' brains was abnormal. White matter acts as the main communication link for sending commands from the brain's grey matter to the rest of the body. It consists mostly of axons, the long extensions of nerve cells that form the links to different parts of the nervous system. These connections are encased in a substance called myelin, which acts like the plastic insulation around an electrical wire. With the loss of white matter, instructions to the body would fail to get through. This fits with the symptoms: patients' cognitive function is largely unaffected, but their motor skills can be destroyed. The MRI scans were clear: the white matter was melting away and being replaced with cerebrospinal fluid, the watery liquid that bathes the brain and spinal cord 3 . This led van der Knaap to name the condition \u2018vanishing white matter\u2019 or VWM disease \u2014 now known as VWM/CACH. Schiffmann has a theory about how the disease progresses. \u201cThe first thing that goes wrong is the insulation of the wire,\u201d he says. \u201cThen at some point, the wires themselves begin to tear.\u201d In the end, the white matter disappears completely. By the late 1990s, the hunt for the genetic roots of VWM/CACH was on. We now know that it can be caused by mutations in five different genes, each on a different chromosome 4 , 5 . Normally, this scattering would have made it all but impossible to track the genes down. But a quirk of Dutch genealogy came to the rescue. \n               Local knowledge \n             Van der Knaap's team was collecting samples and data from families in the Netherlands, where 1 in 40,000 people are affected. Most of the families involved came from a rural region in the east of the country where the population has tended not to migrate or intermarry with people from elsewhere (see right). This gave a relatively homogeneous genetic background against which it was easier to detect disease-causing genes. And the researchers had a further stroke of luck when they found that several affected families shared a single common ancestor. Within this \u2018superfamily\u2019, the researchers were able to scan the genomes of affected and unaffected individuals to identify a gene involved in VWM/CACH. The culprit, the gene for part of a protein called eIF2B, came as a surprise 6 . Far from being specific to the brain, this protein is present in almost every cell in the body. It plays a key role in stitching together amino acids to make proteins according to the recipe laid down in RNA, a process known as translation. The eIF2B protein is made of five fragments or subunits, coded for by the five different genes. It unites with ten other proteins to form a \u2018machine\u2019 that helps control the translation process. And when van der Knaap and her colleagues looked at other VWM/CACH patients, they found that they had mutations in the genes for these other subunits 4 , 5 . The discovery that faults in the control of translation can cause such a dramatic disease has thrown a fresh spotlight on the importance of the process in health and disease 7 . \u201cIt's triggered wider excitement,\u201d says Christopher Proud, now at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, Canada, who has worked on eIF2B and related translation factors for some 15 years. When thinking about the control of the production line from gene to protein, most interest has focused on the earlier process of transcription. In this step, DNA is \u2018read\u2019 to produce messenger RNA, or mRNA. Various proteins known as transcription factors control this process, and they have come under intense scrutiny from cell biologists and researchers interested in diseases such as cancer. The mRNA gets carefully edited and is then sent to complex molecular \u2018robots\u2019 called ribosomes, which read it and slot the amino acids together in the order detailed in the code. Together with its partners, eIF2B helps to position the ribosome at the correct starting point as it scans along the mRNA. One intriguing aspect of VWM/CACH is that its severity can vary, depending on where the mutation lies in the eIF2B protein. Proud and his colleagues suggest that this is because different mutations have different effects on eIF2B's ability to function and interact with the other proteins that regulate its activity 8 . It seems that different mRNAs have different sensitivities to the level of eIF2B. This might help explain the puzzle of why the brain, and particularly the cells that make myelin, is most affected in VWM/CACH. If these cells rely especially heavily on eIF2B to make their key proteins, they will be more sensitive to drops in its level of activity. \n               Communication breakdown \n             The emerging understanding of VWM/CACH fits with a growing realization that the control of translation is more subtle than anyone thought. \u201cIt took a long time, but the wind is changing,\u201d says Arrigo De Benedetti, a molecular biologist who works on translation at Louisiana State University in Shreveport. \u201cPeople are finally recognizing protein synthesis as a major player in disease in general, and in cancer in particular.\u201d The suggestion that faulty translation could cause cancer has been around for about 15 years. In 1990, a team led by Nahum Sonenberg at McGill University in Montreal, Canada, showed that another translation factor, called eIF4E, can make cells become cancerous if present in abnormally high amounts 9 . In patients, high levels of this protein are also associated with resistance to anticancer therapy and with the disease's spread through the body. Meanwhile, other cancer researchers have noticed that some proteins are present at abnormal levels in cancer cells despite there being no obvious problem with the production of their mRNAs \u2014 hinting that translation, not transcription, is at fault. Some mRNAs respond more to changes in the activity of eIF4E than others. Biologists now know that this is because each mRNA has a long, untranslated region at its start that affects how it responds to different translation factors, depending on its sequence or three-dimensional structure 10 .  As if this weren't complicated enough, there is another kind of untranslated region that also affects how mRNAs respond to translation factors. These regions are long \u2014 up to a third of the length of the entire mRNA. They fold into elaborate structures, called internal ribosome entry sites, or IRESs, that together with control proteins summon ribosomes to read the mRNA 11 . Mutations in IRESs have been linked to a number of diseases. They have been found in cancer patients in genes that control cell division, for example. Other translation-control mechanisms are probably waiting to be discovered. \u201cThere could be lots of other things out there,\u201d says Anne Willis, a molecular biologist at the University of Nottingham, UK, who works on IRESs and their role in cancer. \u201cThey've just not really been looked for.\u201d Unravelling the complexities of translational control may look daunting, but its very subtlety may be to clinicians' advantage. In theory, it should be possible to selectively target the production of particular proteins implicated in disease without causing wide-ranging side effects. \u201cThere are probably dozens, if not hundreds, of compounds that can inhibit steps in translation and have not been exploited yet to their full extent,\u201d says De Benedetti. \n               Targeted effect \n             In fact, one such drug is currently in clinical trials to treat cancer. Rapamycin, originally developed as an immunosuppressant, targets one of the systems that regulates translation 12 . The drug shuts down a protein called mTOR, which senses aspects of the cell's environment, such as the availability of nutrients, and allows the cell to grow and divide if all is well. One of the ways it does this is by controlling the activity of translation factors. In many cancers, normal mTOR signalling seems to break down. It should also be possible to target specific translation factors directly. And in the long run, Schiffmann and others hope that it may be possible to help VWM/CACH patients by targeting eIF2B or the affected mRNAs. \u201cThe problem is that it is really too early to say how one would do that,\u201d says Proud. \u201cWe need to know a lot more about how the condition works.\u201d Researchers working on VWM/CACH are now concentrating on developing mouse models of the disease and studying the biology of affected brain cells. They are also identifying other variants of VWM/CACH caused by different eIF2B mutations 13 , 14 , 15 . For example, van der Knaap has identified mutations that cause severe, early-onset disease that affects multiple organs and causes babies to die before birth or in the first few months of life 16 . It was while working on that project that she happened on organ samples and MRI data from a family that had lost three baby girls to an undiagnosed white-matter disease. So it was in 2003 that the Salsburys got the phone call they had long waited for. It was van der Knaap, who had discovered eIF2B mutations in their daughters' brain tissue. As well as helping the Salsburys recover from their loss, the knowledge offers the family's surviving children the opportunity to be tested for the mutations, so they won't have to endure the same ordeal when they come to have families of their own. The Salsburys have now set up a charity, the Three Little Angels Foundation, to raise money for research and to improve awareness of rare neurological diseases. They are passionate advocates of donating organs for research. \u201cWe see science and medicine as an evolving effort,\u201d says Michael. \u201cEach single daughter gave science a new piece of knowledge.\u201d \n                     Epigenetics and disease: Altered states \n                   \n                     Three Little Angels Foundation \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},
{"file_id": "435728a", "url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/435728a", "year": 2005, "authors": [{"name": "Geoff Brumfiel"}], "parsed_as_year": "2006_or_before", "body": "In the world of billion-dollar particle physics, one lab is taking an enormous gamble on its future. Geoff Brumfiel takes a look at Fermilab's hopes to host the next big machine. Sitting in a temporary office, Pier Oddone seems relaxed, even confident. Next month, the 60-year-old physicist takes the helm of the leading high-energy physics laboratory in the United States, at a time when the lab's particle accelerator \u2014 its  raison d'\u00eatre  \u2014 is scheduled to close within five years. But Oddone is optimistic about the lab's future. \u201cIt is a tremendous opportunity to move vigorously in new directions,\u201d he says. Oddone will be the fifth director of the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, or Fermilab, a 2,100-person government facility located in Batavia on the edge of the Illinois prairie. The lab is home to the Tevatron \u2014 the most powerful particle collider in the world today. But within three years or so it will be supplanted by a bigger machine at CERN, the European high-energy physics laboratory near Geneva. When that happens, the US government plans to switch off the Tevatron, leaving Fermilab with a very uncertain future. Fermilab's full-time employees are understandably feeling nervous, says Robert Roser, a physicist and spokesperson for the Collider Detector Facility (CDF), one of the Tevatron's detector experiments. \u201cIf it doesn't have any physics going on, a lab like this could be very tempting to shut down,\u201d he says bluntly. \n               Making plans \n             Oddone's hope is to make Fermilab the home to a newer, bigger accelerator called the International Linear Collider. This would be the largest collider yet: 30 kilometres long and capable of smashing electrons together at energies of 500 billion electronvolts (eV) using state-of-the-art superconducting technology. It's so ambitious that physicists know it will take an international effort to build it. It would also cost a whopping US$6 billion, according to more conservative estimates. Oddone wants to work with international partners to begin building the linear collider at Fermilab by the end of the decade. To pull it off will require scientific cooperation, international diplomacy and a huge financial commitment from the US government. The plan is a gamble, one that could restore Fermilab to its former glory, or leave it adrift without a clear mission or future. Critics say that laboratory administrators are staking too much on a machine that has yet to win political support in the United States. But supporters say that to win big you have to dream big. Physicists started building the Tevatron in 1979 with just such big dreams in mind \u2014 among them the goal of confirming the existence of the top quark. Quarks are the building blocks that make up protons, neutrons and other subatomic particles and the top and bottom quarks are the heaviest. The bottom quark had been detected at Fermilab in 1977, using the existing main ring accelerator. To find the heavier top quark meant smashing protons and anti-protons together at energies between 500 million and 1.5 billion eV, which the Tevatron was designed to do. With further modifications, the collider netted the top quark in 1995. This discovery created elation among physicists and a headache for Fermilab management: what next? Fermilab was not the only US particle-physics lab facing this dilemma. Nobel laureate Burton Richter, director emeritus at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Centre (SLAC) in Menlo Park, California, says he had a similar problem in 1992. The lab's electron accelerator, which was the first to detect quarks in 1968, was at the end of a long line of upgrades, and there was no space to expand. So, Richter says, they decided to convert the accelerator into a powerful X-ray source, which could be used by biologists, chemists and materials scientists to determine the structure of molecules and materials. SLAC also began to diversify its research, moving into astrophysics, \u03b3-ray detection and cosmology. Today the lab is thriving and its budget is rising steadily. Just last month SLAC announced a major restructuring to complete its transition to a multipurpose facility. \u201cThe new structure is adapted to allow our scientists to get on with what they do best \u2014 make major discoveries,\u201d says SLAC director Jonathan Dorfan. Rather than diversifying, Fermilab took the decision in the 1990s to upgrade the Tevatron to even higher energies. This time their quarry was the Higgs boson, which, if theorists' predictions are correct, helps explain why everything in the Universe has mass. Bagging the Higgs would be a huge coup for Fermilab. The US government spent hundreds of millions of dollars on the latest upgrade, which was completed in 2001. But the ageing Tevatron wasn't up to the task: its foundations had sagged over the years, and some of the new technology intended to boost its power behaved unpredictably. Budgets ran tight, and progress was slow. Today, after four difficult years, things are going smoothly, but so much time has been lost that few believe the Tevatron will discover the Higgs particle before CERN's machine is switched on in 2008. Which leaves Fermilab in limbo, according to Richter. A year after CERN's machine turns on, the Tevatron will switch off, leaving lots of physicists with little to do, he says: \u201cThey have gotten themselves in a peculiar position, now the question is how do they get out of it?\u201d \n               Keeping the faith \n             One solution may now be to diversify as SLAC has done. Fermilab has begun expanding its research in neutrinos \u2014 uncharged particles that pervade the Universe. Earlier this year, Fermilab turned on a $170-million neutrino beam, aimed at a detector more than 700 kilometres away in the Soudan Mine in Minnesota. And several facilities are now being planned that would extend Fermilab's neutrino science well into the next decade. But neutrino research will not be enough to sustain the facility at its present level, and many physicists at Fermilab remain disdainful of distractions from the lab's original mission. \u201cDiversifying is the easier solution, but the hard road is more meaningful,\u201d says Young-Kee Kim, a physicist and spokesperson for the CDF. \u201cFrom my point of view, we have to have a high-energy centre in the United States, or we'll lose the energy frontier.\u201d Oddone agrees. \u201cThe International Linear Collider is the greatest opportunity for this lab right now,\u201d he says. With the US Department of Energy, Fermilab is stepping up its accelerator and detector research to make a strong bid for the new machine. If all goes well, Oddone says, the lab will again be the centre of world physics by early next decade as the linear collider probes exotic particles, such as the Higgs, in greater detail. But that's a big if. Collaborations on the scale needed to build the linear collider are notoriously difficult \u2014 fraught with cost overruns, infighting and international politics. And even if the collider does move forward, it may not be built in the United States. Japan is energetically pursuing its own plans to host the machine at its KEK facility, according to Yoji Totsuka, KEK's director-general. The uncertainty is making it difficult for Fermilab to retain the thousands of visiting scientists it needs to run its existing experiments. Already, the Tevatron's two main detectors, CDF and DZero, are suffering from staff shortages. \u201cA lot of people are in the process of moving or have already moved,\u201d says Jerry Blazey, spokesperson for DZero. \u201cRight now we're just doing our best to hang on,\u201d adds Luciano Ristori, a CDF scientist. This situation also makes it harder to attract the expertise needed to develop linear collider prototypes. \u201cIt's very difficult,\u201d says Hendrick Weerts, who has taken a sabbatical from Michigan State University in Lansing to work on prototype detectors. \u201cUsers know there's a really unique physics opportunity coming at CERN in the next two or three years, and they don't want to work on something that might not start until 2016.\u201d As a trip to the lab's cafeteria reveals, that problem is likely to get worse, not better. Sitting at one table is a group of four young Tevatron researchers from all over the world. They all say they support Fermilab's decision to build the linear collider, but only one \u2014 a Fermilab employee \u2014 says he will stay at the lab after CERN's machine is turned on. The lab is doing its best to stem the tide. One stopgap is a computing centre that will allow US researchers to monitor their experiments at CERN from a distance. \u201cWe're going to see the same data as they see in CERN,\u201d says Avi Yagil, who is heading the centre's development. Fermilab is a critical link on the Grid, a distributed computing network that will transmit the Large Hadron Collider's data to the international physics community. Yagil says he hopes that these efforts can prevent the lab from becoming, as he puts it, \u201cscorched earth\u201d, but will it be enough to keep the lab going? Richter doesn't think so, and he is highly critical of the lab's leadership for not doing more to diversify their programme. \u201cThere has never been a coherent long-term view at Fermilab of what you're going to do in the next act, that is in 10 or 15 years,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd that's what got them where they are.\u201d Oddone begs to differ. Fermilab has the staff, knowledge and space to build the next big accelerator, he says. But anything less than a full commitment will not make the dream come true. \u201cYes, there are tremendous risks,\u201d he says. \u201cBut the questions we are trying to answer are also tremendous.\u201d \n                     Fermilab faces up to uncertain future \n                   \n                     Below-par performance hampers Fermilab quest for Higgs boson \n                   \n                     First for physics Chicago \n                   \n                     Towards a clean collider \n                   \n                     New physics with the Compact Linear Collider \n                   \n                     Fermilab: \n                   \n                     SLAC: \n                   \n                     CERN: \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

But, as Jim Giles reports, they have harsh consequences for scientists who do not fit in with government priorities. It's mid-afternoon in Havana's cavernous convention centre, and Cuba's leading scientists are extolling the virtues of the revolution. Cuba's vaccine programme, says one speaker, is the fruit of socialism. Another tells us that the revolutionary leaders have saved the country's environment. Behind him, and not for the first time this afternoon, the giant screen is filled with an image of the commander-in-chief, the bearded one: Fidel Castro. It's classic propaganda, of course. But this impoverished Caribbean nation does punch above its weight in science, boasting achievements such as the world's only effective vaccine against meningitis B. Despite suffering decades of crippling US sanctions (see  \u2018Neighbourhood dispute\u2019 ), and an economic meltdown since the collapse of the Soviet Union, Cuba has achieved first-world levels of education and trained a skilled scientific workforce. But it has done so while restricting the ability of scientists to work in other countries \u2014 a freedom that academics in many other nations take for granted. For an outsider, it is a strange and confusing environment. \u201cYou'll never understand Cuba,\u201d jokes William Edmundson, director of the British Council in Havana, who has organized numerous UK\u2013Cuban science exchange programmes. \u201cI'm much more relaxed now that I've given up trying.\u201d But after spending a week visiting the country's research institutes, the logic that underpins Cuban science begins to fall into place. Government-funded science is more like a corporate research programme than an academic pursuit; scientists' individual interests are subservient to goals determined from above. But instead of being driven by profits, these goals are set according to the social priorities of Castro's revolutionary government. With Cuba's economy in desperate trouble, this approach has increasingly concentrated resources on applied biomedical, environmental and agricultural projects, leaving basic research out in the cold. Cuba's science model has its roots in the 1959 revolution. Over the 30 years that followed, Castro built strong links with the Soviet bloc, sending young researchers to the Soviet Union for training. But unlike Soviet science, which had a strong bias towards projects that strengthened the military\u2013industrial complex, Cuba focused on health and social benefits. \u201cWe combined applied and basic research, but all of it was for the good of society,\u201d says Pedro Vald\u00e9s Sosa of the Cuban Neuroscience Center in Havana, who helped to establish the country's first brain research lab in 1970. \n               Dire straits \n             When the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, Cuban science reached a crunch point. Cuba suddenly lost its biggest trading partner and source of economic aid. During the \u2018special period\u2019 \u2014 the government's euphemistic term for the country's crisis during the early nineties \u2014 about a third was sliced off the nation's gross domestic product (GDP). Rather than letting all Cuba's labs suffer equally, Castro's government chose to continue investing in applied research projects, while effectively allowing basic research to wither on the vine. Money continued to flow into the Western Havana Scientific Pole \u2014 a leafy suburb that is home to 50 or so mostly applied research centres and their industrial offshoots. Official statistics are hard to come by, but around US$1 billion is thought to have been invested in the Scientific Pole during the 1990s. It was to celebrate the fortieth birthday of one of the pole's institutes, the National Center for Scientific Research, that the convention-centre conference was organized. The Scientific Pole can claim some impressive biomedical achievements: in addition to the meningitis B vaccine, it has produced a cancer vaccine that, despite considerable opposition from anti-Castro politicians, has been licensed for use in the United States. And about two dozen foreign drugs firms are considering exploiting other Cuban products, says George Morris, chief operating director of the London-based Beckpharma, which commercializes drugs developed in academic institutes. Not bad for a nation whose GDP per capita is around a tenth of the European average, and where scientists earn just a few hundred dollars a month. Standing in a muddy field in wellington boots and a grubby sleeveless top, Osvaldo Franchi-Alfaro Roque embodies another Cuban enterprise that is attracting foreign interest. Although agricultural research hasn't enjoyed the same high-tech success as biomedical research, it is noted for its innovation and environmental friendliness \u2014 both enforced through economic necessity. Franchi collaborates extensively with the University of Agriculture of Havana, and his farm in San Jos\u00e9 is like an open-air inventor's workshop: his device to control irrigation flows, built mainly from a plastic bottle and parts scavenged from old cars, has been adopted by farmers across Cuba and neighbouring countries. A large tank next to his avocado trees contains homemade organic pesticide \u2014 a mixture of water and local natural products, including seeds from the neem tree ( Azadirachta indica ). This make-do-and-mend approach is a Cuban tradition, but became vital during the special period. Franchi and other small farmers were forced to experiment with organic pesticides and fertilizers, thanks to the collapse of agrochemical imports from the Soviet Union, and the continuing US trade embargo. Such small-scale and organic local production is now attracting the interest of some US researchers, who are keen to explore environmentally friendly alternatives to industrial farming. \u201cI take my students to Cuba because of the contrast with US agricultural systems,\u201d says Catherine Badgley of the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, who studies small-scale farming systems. Badgley admires the way in which Cuban researchers are helping the country's growing number of small farmers develop new crop varieties and cheap methods of pest control that are free of synthetic chemicals. \u201cPeople in Cuba are going into farming from other professions,\u201d she notes. \u201cThe opposite is happening in the rest of the world.\u201d Indeed, Franchi only took up agriculture when his construction business began to struggle in the early 1990s. Franchi's farm and the gleaming labs of Havana's Scientific Pole seem worlds apart, but Cuban scientists see a common theme. Neither would exist, they say, without socialist policies for applying science to local communities and setting research agendas in terms of public need. Franchi and his academic collaborators, for example, enjoy close ties with village mayors, and advise them on how to deal with everything from hurricane damage to energy efficiency. Cuba's biotechnology institutes, in turn, take advice on priorities from the country's extensive network of family doctors \n               For the people \n             Up in the hills of Las Terrazas, a 250-square-kilometre evergreen forest reserve that is home to more than a hundred bird species, the tight links between science and the government's social policies are particularly clear. When Castro came to power, the hillsides of Las Terrazas had been stripped practically bare for agriculture and fuel. Since then, forestry scientists and conservation biologists have overseen the planting of some 6 million trees \u2014 mostly indigenous species such as teak and mahogany. The residents of a new town built in the heart of the reserve were recruited to run the forestry projects and, since the 1990s, ecotourism schemes that bring in around 25,000 visitors a year. \u201cLas Terrazas is a remarkable place because people live here and support the mission of the reserve\u201d, says Badgley. \u201cThere are terrible confrontations between conservationists and indigenous people in other parts of the developing world.\u201d Visiting model initiatives such as Las Terrazas and the Scientific Pole, it's easy to think that Cuba is working miracles in science. But a trip to Roberto Cao Vazquez's chemistry lab at the University of Havana reveals the grim reality for researchers whose interests don't chime with the government's priorities. I enter on a steamy afternoon, having picked my way down the rubble-strewn passage outside. In the lab, the air-conditioning barely functions. A torn and yellowing periodic table hangs on the wall. The chemicals stores look pitiful. Cao, who works on fundamental aspects of supramolecular chemistry, is one of the have-nots of Cuban science. \n               Worlds apart \n             A jovial man with a pronounced American accent \u2014 the result of studying in a US-run school in Venezuela \u2014 Cao smiles wryly as he describes his plight. Journals: he doesn't have access to any, and relies on colleagues to send copies of interesting papers by e-mail. Chemicals: his budget is just US$1,500 for the year. Equipment: his group has the country's only nuclear magnetic resonance machine, but it is so old that foreign researchers would laugh at it. \u201cWe're trying to do first-world science under third-world conditions,\u201d he says. Cao and his colleagues survive by scraping together grants from abroad and through gifts of supplies brought by visiting foreign colleagues. As a result, they are able to publish in good journals, although progress in their labs is slow. \u201cWhen I go and work with colleagues in Spain I am three times more efficient,\u201d says Cao. Further evidence of Cuba's scientific divide comes from a visit to the University of Havana's marine biology lab. The team is respected by foreign conservationists, who admire the close links and influence the biologists have with Cuban leaders. But in the grand government scheme, studies of marine bio-diversity rank well below vaccine development, and the scientists are often kept from their field sites because they can't afford fuel for their research boat. \u201cOur vessel is a Cuban innovation,\u201d adds group member Gaspar Gonzalez Sanson, to the laughter of his colleagues. \u201cIt's made of stone.\u201d Because carbon fibre is an expensive commodity in Cuba, the vessel's builders instead bent an iron-mesh frame into the shape of a hull and covered it with cement. It's not pretty or easily manoeuvrable \u2014 but it works. \u201cThey're a wonderful group,\u201d says David Guggenheim, a marine biologist at Texas A&M University in Corpus Christi, who is working with Gonzalez to survey the bio-diversity of Cuba's western shores. \u201cBut they're strapped for cash.\u201d Scientists at Cuba's better-heeled institutes have little to say about the plight of researchers such as Cao and Gonzalez. And many Cubans are reluctant to discuss factors that hinder their work \u2014 such as rules governing foreign trips. Relative to most of Cuba's citizens, it is easy for scientists to travel. But if a researcher outstays the time permitted by the government, their status at home changes radically. \u201cThen you can come back but only for short periods,\u201d says Cao. \u201cIt's a one-way ticket.\u201d These restrictions present young researchers with a horrible dilemma. \u201cYoung people are very impressed when they come and see a big lab abroad,\u201d says one Cuban researcher working in Europe, who asked not to be named. But with many travel permits valid for just a few months, she explains, they then face a choice between sacrificing an opportunity to stay longer and do good research, or being separated from their families. A former professor from the University of Havana has first-hand experience of this, having overstayed his permission to work in Spain: \u201cI lost my position in the university and realized that my name had been erased from presentations I used to co-author.\u201d Given the hardships suffered by researchers outside the charmed circle of priority applied research projects, it is surprising not to hear more complaints from Cuban researchers. Government control may be one factor; open dissent is a risky policy in a non-democratic country. But equally important is an awareness that Cuba has battled against the odds to avoid the chaos and privations suffered by neighbouring countries such as Haiti. Older Cuban scientists, who remember the right-wing dictatorship that preceded Castro, are especially proud of what's been achieved. The generally positive spin favoured by Cuban researchers is also reminiscent of first-world corporate culture. And to my surprise, many Cuban scientists and research managers are comfortable with this comparison \u2014 although quick to stress the differences. \u201cThe success is not sales, it's the impact on society,\u201d says Manuel Ra\u00edces P\u00e9rez-Caste\u00f1eda, a business development manager at the Center for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology, the premier institute in the Scientific Pole. \u201cWe're chasing problems, not profits.\u201d \n               Setting an example \n             But can Cuba continue this chase in the longterm, having effectively turned its back on basic research? Halla Thorsteinsd\u00f3ttir, a public-health expert at the University of Toronto in Canada, who has studied Cuban biotechnology, suspects that the lack of dedicated fundamental research may not be a huge problem. \u201cIt's hard to generalize across fields, but in biotech the boundaries between pure and applied research are fuzzy,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd Cubans also have the expertise to take advantage of basic research done elsewhere.\u201d Having so decisively concentrated its resources on a relatively small number of priority projects, Cuba has also become an experiment in scientific planning for countries that cannot afford to match the rich world's across-the-board approach. If it works, other nations are likely to go down the same route. \u201cDeveloping countries can learn a lot from Cuba,\u201d Thorsteinsd\u00f3ttir argues. \n                     Nature Biotechnology 19, 905\u2013907 (2001) \n                   \n                     Nature  Biotechnology 22, DC19\u2013DC24 (2004) \n                   \n                     Nature Reviews Drug Discovery  3, 738 (2004) \n                   \n                     Nature 388, 705 (21 August 1997) \n                   \n                     www.cnic.edu.cu \n                   \n                     www.cneuro.edu.cu \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Jessica Ebert meets the researchers who are building their own customized solutions to overcome these problems.  \u201cRussia...Sweden...Denmark.\u201d A mechanized voice calls out the names of European nations as Stan Berman moves his fingers delicately over the raised dots on a piece of thick white paper. The paper lies on a touch-sensitive pad attached to a laptop computer. A map of Europe, formed in outline by small, raised circles, is faintly visible on the paper. Berman, a blind business and technology consultant who provides services for the visually impaired, sits quietly with his eyes closed and head tilted slightly back as the words continue to stream from the computer's speakers. \u201cUnited Kingdom...Ireland...\u201d \u201cThis is quite neat,\u201d he says. Berman and his colleague, Dan Grauman from the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, are sitting in a sunlit kitchen in Columbia, Maryland, to test-drive a gadget known as IVEO \u2014 one of the newest assistive technologies for the blind. IVEO is the brainchild of John Gardner, a solid-state physicist turned entrepreneur who is also blind. It is the latest in a long line of products that he has invented to remove barriers that prevent the visually impaired from fully appreciating maths and science. Like many researchers with disabilities, Gardner had to develop his own technologies for doing science and communicating his work because commercial solutions were seldom available. \u201cI have a very strong philosophy that we all ought to be reading the same things,\u201d says Gardner. \u201cWhen there isn't a way to do it, we make a way.\u201d Virginia Stern, director of the project on science, technology and disability at the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) in Washington DC, attributes the advances in assistive technology to the can-do attitude of people with disabilities such as Gardner. \u201cAssistive technology has dramatically changed opportunities for students with disabilities,\u201d she says. \u201cIt's been the push of the users, some of whom have developed things because they knew what they needed.\u201d Gardner grew up blind in the left eye. Although he also had poor vision in his right eye, \u201cIt was correctable enough so I could drive \u2014 or as my friends say, \u2018aim\u2019 \u2014 a car,\u201d he says. \n               A difficult lesson \n             Gardner's early physics career took him from Texas to Illinois and then to Munich, Germany, where he studied the nuclear magnetic resonance of liquid copper alloys. In 1973, after six years on the physics faculty at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, he headed west to Oregon State University in Corvallis. In 1988, Gardner had an operation to treat the glaucoma in his right eye. But rather than slow the loss of vision in that eye, complications left him prematurely blind. \u201cIt was not a pleasant time,\u201d he recalls. Although he was away from the lab for a few months, he stopped working for only a couple of days. \u201cI had so many graduate students and postdocs and grants and proposals in the works, I wasn't allowed to be sick,\u201d he smiles. When he finally returned to the lab, he faced a new set of challenges. \u201cI didn't know how to be blind,\u201d he explains. \u201cNo one knew what to do with me.\u201d Initially, Gardner's students would tape-record journal papers for him and try to describe what their data looked like by taking his finger and tracing the curves in a graph or a picture. It took him months to discover that blind people could use computers. \u201cI had a computer that was just sitting and gathering dust in my office,\u201d he says. He can still recall the time he was introduced to screen readers, the software that converts what is displayed on a computer screen into either audio or a Braille output that can be read on a special keyboard. \u201cThat was one of the better days,\u201d he says. From that moment on, Gardner began inventing tools that allowed him to continue his lab work. He never planned to abandon physics in pursuit of his innovations, but there was such an unmet need for the tools that he found himself moving in that direction. \u201cI didn't really want to become an entrepreneur,\u201d he says, \u201cbut someone had to.\u201d In the early 1990s, Gardner was awarded a grant from the National Science Foundation (NSF) to establish the Science Access Project at Oregon. In the past ten years, the project has developed technologies to overcome the biggest barriers for those with poor vision: reading and writing mathematical and scientific notation, and viewing graphs, tables, charts and diagrams. Today, Gardner is demonstrating IVEO to Grauman and Berman. Grauman's job as an information technologist at the National Cancer Institute includes making sure that maps showing cancer mortality across the United States can be used by everyone. Since 1998, federal agencies have been required to make their information and technology, including websites, operating systems and kiosks, accessible to people with disabilities. \n               All mapped out \n              Although the maps Grauman has developed meet federal requirements, problems remain. \u201cThey don't give the blind user the relative location of the states,\u201d he explains. IVEO is expected to change that. \u201cThe beauty of the touchpad is that it will permit the blind user to move east and west, or north and south, and actually \u2018see\u2019 whether there are neighbouring states with high cancer mortality rates,\u201d he says. Universal access to the products of scientific research \u2014 from public-health information to data on environmental pollutants \u2014 is just one aspect of assistive technology. But for students with disabilities, having access to the right technology can determine whether they choose to enter science at all. That was true for Aqil Sajjad, a physics student from Pakistan, who says that the specialized software WinTriangle, which helps the visually impaired read and write mathematics, was a lifeline. Sajjad lost his eyesight in 1996 at the age of 16. Although science had intrigued him from a young age, he couldn't get the support he needed to study physics in his homeland. He began searching the Internet for educational opportunities in the United States because he knew the 1990 Americans with Disabilities Act had opened new doors for students with disabilities. At some point during his search, Sajjad stumbled on the work of Gardner's Science Access Project and knew that this was where he wanted to pursue his passion for physics. \u201cIt was crucial for my decision that Gardner was a blind physicist and was developing these tools,\u201d he recalls. \u201cWinTriangle turned out to be the thing I needed.\u201d WinTriangle, which was produced by the Science Access Project, allows a blind user to write mathematical equations, perform calculations and hear mathematical text. In its simplest form it is a scientific word processor with a specialized set of fonts representing symbols and operations that can be read by a speech synthesizer. Sajjad has now moved on and is a first-year doctoral student in theoretical physics at Harvard University in Boston, Massachusetts. Here, physicists write papers using a typesetting language called LaTeX, so David Thompson, a fellow student, wrote a software program to convert LaTeX into WinTriangle. \u201cThe concept behind this is so simple,\u201d says Thompson, but the significance for Sajjad is enormous. \u201cWe're completing the path of communication of maths between blind and sighted communities,\u201d he explains. \n               Open access \n             Thompson and the Adaptive Technology Laboratory at Harvard are now ironing out some of the glitches in the program and adding features to the converter to make it more robust, such as improving the quality of the voice synthesizer and adding more keyboard shortcuts. \u201cHaving the converter makes a huge amount of information available to me,\u201d says Sajjad. \u201cIt has made a big difference in terms of levelling the playing field between me and other people.\u201d WinTriangle is \u2018open-source\u2019 software, which lets users adapt and rewrite it to meet their needs. It is fairly common for assistive technologies to be modified or enhanced by their users. Gardner recently teamed up with Victor Wong, James Ferwerda and Ankur Moitra at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, who have developed software that translates colour pixels on a computer screen into piano notes. The group hopes to combine the audio software with IVEO's tactile technology to solve a particularly challenging information problem. Wong, who lost his sight in an accident when he was seven, works with a team that studies the ionosphere, the layer of the atmosphere between Earth and space. Part of Wong's work involves reading maps of the ionosphere in which colours represent variables such as electron density and light intensity. \u201cTo be able to visualize a map is a very basic need,\u201d says Wong. \u201cThere is no way to handle the image problem right now.\u201d With the Cornell system, Wong uses a touch-sensitive tablet to explore three-dimensional images with a \u2018wireless\u2019 electronic pen. \u201cWhen you move the pen around on the tablet it's the same as looking around on the screen,\u201d explains Wong. When using the tablet, Wong finds the pen is almost too sensitive \u2014 it is actually better than the naked eye and gives too much detail.

And for some people, such technology doesn't yet go quite far enough (see  \u2018Breaking down the barriers\u201d ). \n                     Inside Deaf culture \n                   \n                     Genetics: Deaf by design \n                   \n                     EntryPoint!: \n                   \n                     WinTriangle: \n                   \n                     Science Access Project: \n                   \n                     ViewPlus Technologies: \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Emma Marris asks him how he'll ensure that politicians will listen to the science. Less than a month into his new job, Ralph Cicerone is already on the offensive on Capitol Hill. Taking over as the 21st president of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) on 1 July, Cicerone has had to leave his office littered with unpacked boxes as he heads for Congress to do battle over climate change. Cicerone earned his reputation not as a fighter but as a temperate manager and rational thinker. That level-headedness may serve him well in the volatile environment of Washington, but he clearly is not averse to standing his ground. In his new role, Cicerone will have to work with a US administration that has often clashed with scientists over findings that oppose its approved policy. But he is clear that if the academy's reports come to unpopular conclusions, he won't be shy about letting the world know. \u201cOnce we come up with a position, I don't want to hide it in the closet,\u201d Cicerone told  Nature  last week. \u201cI want it to be out there and useful and maybe a little bit aggressive.\u201d Cicerone seems equally at home dealing with politics as he does defending scientific evidence. One of his early acts as NAS president was to engage Congressman Joe Barton (Republican, Texas) over a letter sent out last month. Barton had demanded that three climate researchers turn over reams of data on their climate-change research, a stance that has sparked disapproval among his fellow Republicans as well as other scientists (see  Senate hearings strengthen calls for US action over climate ). Cicerone entered the fray to offer Barton an independent NAS report to stop individual scientists from being intimidated. \n               Balancing act \n             Balancing science and politics is a basic characteristic of Cicerone's new job. As president of the NAS, he represents the nation's most distinguished scientists. But he is also head of the National Research Council (NRC), which generates most of the influential reports advising the government on scientific issues. Those reports don't always tell policy-makers what they want to hear, particularly when it comes to Cicerone's own field. As an atmospheric chemist, he is well equipped to deal with issues relating to climate change \u2014 a major scientific flashpoint for the Bush administration. Cicerone is probably best known for his contribution to work in the mid-1970s showing that human activities could damage Earth's protective ozone layer. He also played a prominent role in the debate over banning the use of chlorofluorocarbons to ease ozone depletion. In Washington, scientific knowledge is just one of many factors taken into account when making a decision, and quite often not the most important. Cicerone says he is preparing himself to deal with that. \u201cBeing an engineer and a scientist, I tend to think that the facts and the data should dominate everything,\u201d he says. \u201cI have to get used to the fact that a lot of people don't start that way.\u201d Cicerone's career history spans US scientific hotspots, including the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla, California. Most recently he served as chancellor at the University of California, Irvine, where he founded the Department of Earth System Science. \n               Clear vision \n             The 62-year-old Cicerone has been involved with the national academies for years, and has served on 20 of their study committees. In 2001, he chaired an NAS panel on climate change. The resulting report,  Climate Change Science: An Analysis of Some Key Questions , was widely praised as straightforward and easy to understand. It was also phenomenally fast. Academy reports normally take one or two years to complete; Cicerone got the job done in a month. The report helped to put Cicerone's name near the top of the list to succeed Bruce Alberts as NAS president, says Peter Raven, director of the Missouri Botanical Garden in St Louis and chair of the nomination committee that put Cicerone's name forward. Cicerone had extensive Washington experience, is a skilled fundraiser, and knew the NAS so well \u201che could hit the ground running\u201d, says Raven. Cicerone can expect to deal with issues ranging from stem cells to nuclear power \u2014 two topics he mentions as possible subjects for the relatively rare self-funded studies undertaken by the academies. Cicerone's fundraising skills may help pump up the $332-million NAS endowment and allow for a few more homegrown projects, his supporters say. He will also have to balance government interests against scientific openness. Earlier this year, the NAS was caught in a dispute over a paper in its  Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences . The paper presented a model of a bioterrorist attack using botulinum toxin, and officials at the Department of Health and Human Services asked journal editors to pull it, citing security concerns. Alberts, Cicerone's predecessor, delayed the paper, but published it in the end. Cicerone was involved in the decision, and plans to ask the newly formed National Science Advisory Board for Biosecurity for opinions on what could have been done. I don't want to be part of an organization that just shoots off its mouth with opinions that are not as well justified as can be.  Ralph Cicerone, president, National Academy of Sciences But how feisty on political matters is the soft-spoken Cicerone likely to be? \u201cI'll probably be a bit more conservative than people want,\u201d he says. \u201cI don't want to be part of an organization that just shoots off its mouth with opinions that are not as well justified as can be.\u201d For instance, he is prepared to weigh in on arguments over whether science is being misused for political purposes. \u201cI don't want to shy away from those disputes,\u201d he says, \u201cbecause I have such a reverence for science. I don't want to see it twisted or distorted.\u201d But at the same time, he is not ready to say that there is an ongoing pattern of politicization of science that would justify putting a panel together to study the issue. Instead, he thinks the best strategy is to keep the NRC reports flowing, so that if someone tries to mischaracterize science, a study can be slipped off the shelf and presented for a quick refutation. Cicerone does have ideas about specific science policies that the United States should adopt, but the only ones he is eager to talk about at the moment are politically acceptable topics such as energy efficiency. He argues that some simple fixes, such as making sure manufacturers use energy-efficient lighting and motors, aren't made because they are swamped by the charged atmosphere surrounding climate change. \u201cI find it very frustrating,\u201d he says, \u201cthat because of the really difficult questions that cause political polarization, we are missing some of the cherry-pickings.\u201d Sherwood Rowland, a climate scientist and longtime colleague of Cicerone's at Irvine, expects him to speak out strongly in his new role. \u201cHe spent almost his whole career in areas of science that have very strong policy implications, and he has always been upfront about the policies that ought to go along with that,\u201d he says. \n               Public figure \n             Rowland also mentions one of Cicerone's skills that is crucial for successful political manoeuvring: \u201cRalph has a phenomenal memory for people \u2014 who they are, what they do, what their strengths are, and what to look out for.\u201d But any amount of political savvy on Cicerone's part won't bridge the gulf between when people want scientific answers and when the NRC can provide them, or between the massive academy reports and the one-pagers that make up the informational diet of most lawmakers. \u201cIt's a perpetual, continual source of tension here,\u201d says Cicerone. As one possible solution, he envisions making the reports' executive summaries shorter, and releasing interim reports more often. But he also shifts some of the onus onto those who request the reports, urging them to \u201cask questions that won't go away this budget cycle. Ask questions that have longer-lasting value.\u201d Such old-fashioned rationalism drives Cicerone. When creating study committees, he prefers to look for unbiased thinkers rather than balancing an advocate from one side with an advocate from the other. He is aware that some say this is an impossible task. \u201cMany people say that's hopelessly naive: that science is not objective, everything is relative, everything stems from an individual's philosophy of life, ideology and so forth. I don't believe that.\u201d When he's not working for the benefit of scientists, Cicerone plans to set up a long-term project to improve the public understanding of, and enthusiasm for, science. He feels that interest in science is beginning to decline, partly because good popularizers are rare. \u201cI miss Carl Sagan,\u201d he says wistfully. But he is not willing to go along with the often-repeated tale that Sagan was denied NAS membership because of his fondness for appearing on television and writing popular books. During the arguments over whether or not to elect Sagan \u201cthere were good people on both sides of the debate\u201d, says Cicerone.

But how much, and will they continue to do so in a warming world? Quirin Schiermeier speaks to the carbon accountants. It took just one Siberian heatwave to temporarily wipe out most of the gains made by the Kyoto Protocol on climate change. In the summer of 2003, wildfires raced across the region, incinerating an area of some 22 million hectares: slightly smaller than the state of Oregon. As the trees went up in smoke, they released about 250 million tonnes of carbon into the atmosphere \u2014 roughly the same amount as industrialized countries have pledged to cut from their emissions by 2012 under the Kyoto agreement. Natural releases of carbon \u2014 from wild fires, thawing permafrost or drained peatlands \u2014 aren't covered by the Kyoto Protocol, which aims to cut emissions from the burning of fossil fuels. But if future political agreements are to save us from a climate catastrophe, experts agree that we need a much better understanding of natural carbon sources and sinks, and whether they can be manipulated to help put a brake on global warming. Siberia looms large in this debate, its vast forests \u2014 or taiga \u2014 are a potentially huge sink for greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide. Yet so little is known about Siberia's role in the global carbon cycle that researchers have been scrambling to gather basic data. For the past few years, scientists have fanned out across the taiga, working in two projects aimed at quantifying Siberia's carbon budget. \u201cWe need to understand what will happen when climate change really kicks off,\u201d says Wolfgang Lucht, a biosphere researcher at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany. \u201cWhen, in 30 years, governments ask us how the world has changed, we must be able to provide answers.\u201d To that end, 14 institutes have taken part in the Siberia-II, a European Union-funded initiative to quantify the greenhouse-gas budget of a 2-million-square-kilometre area in central Siberia. A complementary project, called the Terrestrial Carbon Observing System, or TCOS, is providing more detailed, real-time measurements of carbon fluxes between Siberian forests and the lower levels of the atmosphere. Both projects, now approaching completion, have yielded a wealth of data. And one fact stands out: Siberia's taiga is a more modest carbon sink than previously thought. \n               Lie of the land \n             These vast forests are by far the largest terrestrial carbon reservoir in the Northern Hemisphere. Unlike tropical rain forests, where logging is the main disturbance to the carbon cycle, changes in the carbon balance in the taiga are being driven mainly by climate change. This makes these forests an ideal place to study the interplay between climate and landscape. Siberia is also a climatic hot spot, with short warm summers and extremely long, cold winters. Temperatures vary greatly from year to year, but on average, surface temperatures in central Siberia have increased by up to 3 \u00b0C since 1960 \u2014 three to four times more than the global average. In a warmed world of the future, Siberia might see some short-term benefits. The warmer temperatures have already sparked a greening trend: spring arrives sooner and buds and leaves appear earlier in the growing season. To some extent, this counteracts the greenhouse effect, as growing plants remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere through photosynthesis. Some Russian scientists and policy-makers critical of the Kyoto Protocol claim that a warmer climate will have positive effects on plant productivity and agriculture in Russia 1 . \n               Tinderbox \n             But the growth spurt is unlikely to continue for ever, says Lucht. \u201cAt some point, even though we don't know when, Siberian forests might begin to suffer from heat stress and die,\u201d he explains. And the long-term picture isn't much better. Although the natural fluctuations are large, and model predictions uncertain, many scientists believe that summers will become warmer and drier in Siberia. This would favour the outbreak of fires, releasing carbon at an even greater rate, says Heiko Baltzer, head of Earth observation at the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology in Monks Wood, UK. Recent research shows that a warmer climate could also enhance soil respiration, permafrost thawing and the decomposition of organic matter in peat, moors and bogs \u2014 all of which result in additional release of carbon 2 , 3 . By the middle of this century, the planet's terrestrial biosphere could turn from a carbon sink into a carbon source 4  \u2014 and global warming would step up a gear. Siberia-II has tried to document the current state of carbon exchange in the region's forests so that future changes can be carefully measured. But it hasn't been an easy task. Project scientists have learned that at least one crucial bit of information is missing: the total biomass contained in Siberia's forests and soils. Satellites can monitor changes in land cover, but they provide little or no information about the actual volume of stems, roots and leaves present. \n               Lost in a forest \n             So forest inventories are crucial. Unfortunately, they are scarce for Siberia, and those that do exist are full of gaps. \u201cMost data from Russian inventories are obsolete, and some are plain wrong,\u201d says Anatoly Shvidenko, a forest ecologist with the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA) in Laxenburg, Austria. \u201cFor example, official Russian statistics either don't account for the large forest fires in 1998 and 2003, or substantially underestimate them,\u201d he says. But Shvidenko, former head of the All-Russian Scientific Research Information Center for Forest Resources in Moscow, is an old hand at dealing with Russian sources. With the help of two partner institutes in Irkutsk and Krasnojarsk, he has touted round and collected together what he believes are the most accurate data on forest inventories, discarding information he knew to be outdated or misleading. This newly compiled inventory will be indispensable for validating remote-sensing data and the results of computer models. The Siberia-II researchers have also developed mathematical models to transform raw satellite data into real-world information, such as how much of the taiga is covered by plants or snow. This information has been checked by scientists heading out into the field to confirm that the satellites were correctly interpreting what they saw on the ground. In addition, team members have produced new maps, which can be used to improve the accuracy of computer models about vegetation in Siberia. The TCOS project, meanwhile, focused on the flux of carbon dioxide between the forest and the atmosphere. Six observational towers, each placed in a separate ecosystem, measured gases in the air up to a height of 30 metres. Once or twice a month, scientists flew aircraft through the lower 2 kilometres of the atmosphere, to measure carbon dioxide levels. Early results have shown not only that the taiga is a relatively modest sink for carbon, but that it may also give off more methane \u2014 a strong greenhouse gas \u2014 than previously thought. Both effects have yet to be fully quantified, but the two projects have made scientists more confident that they can account for the carbon budget for an area this large. The preliminary findings have whetted scientists' appetite for more. In particular, Christiane Schmullius, a remote-sensing expert at Jena University in Germany, who coordinated Siberia-II, wants to use radar to monitor biomass from space. The European Space Agency's Envisat satellite carries a radar sensor, but its ability to determine the height and density of vegetation is limited. \u201cWe have seen in Siberia that remote sensing has the potential to provide all the information needed for full greenhouse-gas accounting,\u201d says Schmullius. NASA plans to take advantage of that fact for its Orbiting Carbon Observatory mission, set to launch in 2008. This satellite will make global carbon dioxide maps twice a month, at a level of detail that would allow it to monitor changes such as those triggered by Siberian wildfires. \n               Branching out \n             Siberia-II has substantially helped to reduce the uncertainties about carbon flux, says Sten Nilsson, a forest scientist at the IIASA. \u201cUncertainties used to be in the range of plus or minus 100%,\u201d he says. \u201cNow we may have halved the margin of error.\u201d Buoyed by the early results, Germany's Max Planck Society has funded an ambitious follow-up project to establish in greater detail how greenhouse gases flow between Siberian forests and the atmosphere. Together with Russian partners, the society is building a 300-metre-high measurement tower near the Yenisey River in central Siberia. The Zotino Tall Tower Observatory, or Zotto, will become operational next year, fully equipped with high-precision tools to measure a variety of greenhouse gases. Zotto will also have an underground laboratory, buried to protect it from climate extremes, for  in situ  analysis. Zotto should help constrain assumptions on how much more greenhouse gas the taiga is capable of sucking up, says Martin Heimann, an atmospheric physicist at the Max Planck Institute for Biogeochemistry in Jena, who coordinates TCOS. Such information, accumulated piece by piece, helps to flesh out the full picture of carbon accounting and so could shape the direction of future climate policies. It may prove to be possible to sort the wood from the trees after all. \n                     Climate change: Crunch time for Kyoto \n                   \n                     Emissions trading: The carbon game \n                   \n                     Acceleration of global warming due to carbon-cycle feedbacks in a coupled climate model \n                   \n                     Long-term sensitivity of soil carbon turnover to warming \n                   \n                     Siberia-II project \n                   \n                     IIASA \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},
{"file_id": "436622a", "url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/436622a", "year": 2005, "authors": [{"name": "Sarah Tomlin"}], "parsed_as_year": "2006_or_before", "body": "Can mathematicians learn from the narrative approaches of the writers who popularize and dramatize their work? Sarah Tomlin is on the story. \u201cMathematicians are quite shy, with very few exceptions,\u201d announced Pierre Cartier of the Institute des Hautes \u00c9tudes Scientifiques, south of Paris, opening his talk on mathematicians who have written autobiographies. \u201cAnd most of them are in this room!\u201d someone shouted from the floor. It was a rousing start to a highly unusual meeting. Last month, a select group of about 30 mathematicians, playwrights, historians, philosophers, novelists and artists descended on the Greek island of Mykonos. The gathering aimed to find common ground between story-telling and mathematics, and was inspired by a profusion of books, movies and plays that, over the past decade, have dragged the subject out of a cultural wilderness. Clearly, stories about mathematics have strong popular appeal. But what can professional mathematicians learn from the writers who are now taking an interest in their work? Can narrative approaches help the increasingly esoteric sub-fields of mathematics communicate with one another? And can such approaches help mathematicians frame the abstract problems that fill their working lives? It was the hope of answering such questions that led the Greek novelist Apostolos Doxiadis to cook up the idea of bringing writers and mathematicians together. After graduating with a mathematics degree from New York's Columbia University at the age of 18, Doxiadis turned to his first loves of poetry and theatre. But in his late thirties, Doxiadis revisited mathematics with his 2001 novel  Uncle Petros and the Goldbach Conjecture , in which the protagonist's attempt to prove this conjecture \u2014 that every even number is the sum of two primes \u2014 becomes a universal story about courage and suffering. Excited by the narrative possibilities offered by mathematics, Doxiadis formed a foundation to further explore the theme \u2014 called Thales & Friends, after the first mathematician and philosopher in ancient Greece. And with financial backing from the Mathematical Sciences Research Institute in Berkeley, California, he set about organizing the Mykonos meeting. At first, the plan was for a smaller informal gathering, but it soon snowballed. \u201cI'm surprised, frankly, at the response,\u201d Doxiadis told  Nature . The venue was apt, given that ancient Greece was where the gulf between mathematics and story-telling first opened up. \u201cPlato approved of mathematics, but despised poetry,\u201d says Rebecca Goldstein, a philosopher and novelist based in Hartford, Connecticut, who has used mathematicians as characters in several novels. Other participants blamed Euclid for introducing the impersonal, logical style that has characterized much mathematical writing ever since. Whatever the historical reasons for the divide, it has been bridged with a vengeance in recent years. The spark came in 1995, with the solution of Fermat's last theorem by the British mathematician Andrew Wiles. His 100-page proof made prime-time news, and was followed by a best-selling book,  Fermat's Enigma  by Simon Singh. Suddenly mathematics was fashionable. Next came a host of popular books on subjects such as zero, pi and irrational numbers, the Hollywood movie  A Beautiful Mind , and plays such as David Auburn's  Proof  and John Barrow's  Infinities . Today, there is even a US television series called  Numb3rs , in which a detective relies on the skills of his mathematical-genius brother to solve crimes. But if it is possible to tell stories about mathematics to a general audience, why do specialists in different branches of the discipline have so much difficulty communicating with one another? \u201cMost mathematics papers are incomprehensible to most mathematicians,\u201d complains Tim Gowers of the University of Cambridge, UK, winner of a 1998 Fields Medal \u2014 the nearest thing the subject has to a Nobel prize. \u201cPublication has become just a formal stamp of approval \u2014 it is not a means of communication anymore,\u201d he adds. Gowers is currently editing the  Princeton Companion to Mathematics , which is scheduled to appear in 2006 and is intended to provide budding mathematicians with an accessible overview of the field. \u201cSay you decided you wanted to do research in mathematics but you didn't know what area would appeal to you,\u201d says Gowers. \u201cThere is nothing available right now.\u201d \n               Tales of tables \n             Narrative approaches can help make arcane branches of mathematics more accessible to specialists, as well as to the lay public, Gowers argues. Persi Diaconis, a statistician at Stanford University in California, agrees. \u201cI can only work on problems if there is a story that is real for me,\u201d he says. As one of the few applied mathematicians at the meeting, Diaconis perhaps has an easier time than most in applying narratives to his work. In Mykonos, he picked three of his papers, and told a story about each. The first was a 1987 paper entitled \u2018Projection pursuit for discrete data\u2019, which deals with a mathematical technique for finding patterns in data in a systematic way. To make this technique come alive, Diaconis chose a real-life problem \u2014 the dating of Plato's most important texts. Scholars had previously classified the last five syllables of Plato's sentences as either \u2018short\u2019 or \u2018long\u2019, in the expectation that his writing style had changed over time, and that this would show up in these data. But they struggled to find anything meaningful. By looking at pairs of syllables using his technique, Diaconis was able to find patterns in the texts that had previously been hidden, and could subsequently work out an order for Plato's works. Diaconis learned to love the abstraction of pure mathematics from his tutor Barry Mazur of Harvard University. But Mazur admits that he used to be mystified when Diaconis would ask: \u201cI'm lost. What's the story?\u201d Today, Mazur says he has woken up to the power of narrative, and in Mykonos gave an example of a 20-year unsolved puzzle in number theory which he described as a cliff-hanger. \u201cI don't think I personally understood the problem until I expressed it in narrative terms,\u201d Mazur told the meeting. He argues that similar narrative devices may be especially helpful to young mathematicians, who seem particularly poor at explaining their work to others. Mazur explained that he used narrative to help him develop a general organizing structure around the problem, which involves a conflict between theory and the large amount of data gathered on elliptic curves. Mazur did not find a solution by using the narrative device of a cliff-hanger, but it helped him to frame the question \u2014 and that, he argues, may be as important. Mazur's explorations of narrative may sound trivial. And some of the writers who attended the Mykonos meeting admitted that they were left cold by this particular story. But Doxiadis explains that mathematicians, unlike experimental scientists, aren't used to dealing with conflicts between data and theory in this way. They like to understand a problem at its most basic level, from the inside. So for a mathematician, Mazur's depiction of his number-theory problem in dramatic terms might be a genuine eye-opener. \u201cThe thing that inspired me was the idea that this could affect mathematics itself,\u201d says philosopher David Corfield of the Max Planck Institute for Biological Cybernetics in T\u00fcbingen, Germany. \n               Maths fever \n             In general, the non-mathematicians in Mykonos were passionate about the mathematical ideas that they have encountered. Alecos Papadatos is a cartoonist who is working on a graphic novel with Doxiadis and others about the history of logicians, most of whom died tragically. He claims he never liked mathematics, but now sees that the discipline is full of exciting stories. Barbara Oliver, who is artistic director of a theatre in Berkeley, California, echoes his view. She enjoyed directing the play  Partition  by Ira Hauptman \u2014 which is loosely based on the lives of two very different mathematicians, G. H. Hardy and Srinivasa Ramanujan \u2014 despite her lack of specialist knowledge. \u201cI'm untutored, unskilled in mathematics,\u201d she says. Whether mathematicians are similarly eager to embrace the joys of narrative remains unclear \u2014 particularly if telling a good story involves compromising standards of mathematical accuracy. Some of the most heated discussions in Mykonos were about the mistakes in a recent popular book on infinity, and whether they really matter. Diaconis, despite being an enthusiastic story-teller, still sees a sharp tension between narrative and mathematics. \u201cTo communicate we have to lie. If we don't we're deadly boring,\u201d he says. Diaconis waited until his 60th birthday to start writing a book on mathematics and magic, and he understands why others are cautious. \u201cThere's no reward for expository stuff, and a bias against it,\u201d he says. Still, the Mykonos meeting at least marked the beginning of a rapprochement between the estranged arts of mathematics and story-telling. Another meeting is planned for next year \u2014 and there is much work to be done, if the tales of the thorniest mathematical problems are ever to be told. Take the Hodge conjecture: according to the website of the Clay Mathematics Institute in Cambridge, Massachusetts, which is offering a US$1 million prize to anyone who can prove it, this asserts that \u201cfor particularly nice types of spaces called projective algebraic varieties, the pieces called Hodge cycles are actually (rational linear) combinations called algebraic cycles\u201d. If that makes no sense to you, don't worry \u2014 most mathematicians regard the Hodge conjecture as \u2018unexplainable\u2019. Let's hope, at least for the sake of the journalists who must try to communicate the essence of the conjecture to the general public if it is ever proved, that mathematicians will by then have honed their narrative skills. \n                     Freudian quips \n                   \n                     Physics and music: Brothers in art \n                   \n                     Mathematics: The reluctant celebrity \n                   \n                     Nature web focus - Scientists on art: artists on science \n                   \n                     Mathematics and Narrative meeting \n                   \n                     Apostolos Doxiadis \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

And can surveillance methods be improved? Simon Frantz investigates.  It's 3 a.m. in a typical US emergency room, and doctors are bustling around a patient in his mid-sixties, one of several admitted that night with severe chest pain. He's anxious, sweating and struggling to breathe \u2014 classic symptoms of a heart attack. By the following evening, he has stabilized, thanks to the prompt administration of streptokinase, which dissolved the clot that was starving his heart muscle of oxygen. It's time to examine factors such as obesity, smoking and blood cholesterol that might have contributed to the attack, and advise the patient about lifestyle changes that will help minimize the chances of a recurrence. An estimated one million Americans are admitted to hospital under similar circumstances each year; about a third of them die. This is an all-too-common emergency, with a host of everyday causes. No one thinks to consider whether the patient's attack might have been triggered by the pills, prescribed to ease the pain of arthritis, sitting on his bedside table back at home. At least that was the case before 30 September 2004, when the pharmaceutical giant Merck withdrew its painkiller Vioxx from the market after it was linked to an increased risk of heart problems. The news was met with confusion, anxiety and outrage. How could the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which is supposed to protect the US population from unsafe medicines, and which approved Vioxx for sale in May 1999, not have noticed the dangers? \n               Hidden dangers \n             Critics argue that the FDA needs to re-examine its priorities in light of the Vioxx scare (see  page 554 ). But whatever the outcome of that debate, the drug's withdrawal has revealed how adverse effects such as heart attacks, which already occur commonly in the general population, can slip under the radar of current drug-safety surveillance. And in the wake of the Vioxx controversy, experts are examining ways in which methods of detecting such effects could be improved. The problem with Vioxx was never going to emerge in the phase III clinical trials that are used to judge whether a drug should be put on the market. The heart attacks occurred in less than 2% of patients who had taken the drug for many months 1 , whereas phase III trials are typically carried out on a few thousand patients over a timescale of several weeks. Only when hundreds of thousands of patients had taken Vioxx for an extended period would any problems become apparent. Such events can only feasibly be investigated after a drug is in general use. Current post-marketing surveillance systems can easily detect adverse events that are unexpected and rare. For instance, the multiple sclerosis treatment Tysabri was withdrawn from the US market in February, about four months after it was given expedited approval, when two people contracted a rare brain disorder called progressive multifocal leucoencephalopathy, or PML. \u201cPML is a very rare event, so this was like a red flag waving,\u201d says Steven Galson, acting director of the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. \n               Invisible enemy \n             The difficulty with common conditions such as heart attacks is that cases that might be triggered by prescription drugs readily get lost in the noise. That's especially true for patients with ailments such as arthritis, who tend to be older, and therefore more susceptible to heart disease. Conventional post-marketing surveillance schemes, which mainly rely on doctors informing drug companies of adverse events associated with their products, and companies in turn informing regulators, are almost useless in this regard. \u201cSpontaneous reporting systems cannot distinguish whether adverse events such as heart attacks are the result of a drug or whether it would happen in that community anyway,\u201d says Alasdair Breckenridge, who chairs the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency.  In such cases, the burden falls on researchers in the field of pharmacoepidemiology, who study clinical databases containing millions of patient records, documenting information on medicines prescribed, hospitalizations and deaths. Taking their cues from potential problems highlighted in clinical trials, case reports or lab experiments, these researchers use statistical tools to study large patient populations over extended periods. \u201cWe look through the databases to find an exposed group and a non-exposed group that are quite similar except that one group gets Vioxx, for example, and one group doesn't,\u201d explains Susan Jick, an epidemiologist at the Boston University School of Public Health, and co-director of the Boston Collaborative Drug Surveillance Program, based in Lexington, Massachusetts. \u201cOr you do a case-control study where you look at similar people who have had, say, a heart attack, and those who haven't, and you see whether they have taken Vioxx or not.\u201d This sounds simple. But in practice, it is a painstaking and labour-intensive process. The problem is particularly acute in cases in which it is difficult to determine whether an adverse event is a consequence of the underlying disease, or the medication \u2014 for example, when studying patients with heart attacks who are taking drugs to control their blood pressure. But even in less ambiguous situations, it's tough to sort patients into groups that can fairly be compared to one another. \n               Class divides \n              In the case of Vioxx, which belongs to a class of drugs called COX-2 inhibitors, concerns about an elevated risk of cardiovascular disease were first raised in 2001 by a reanalysis of a study comparing patients on drugs from this class with those on an older painkiller called naproxen 2 . At the time, Merck suggested this was because of the cardioprotective effect of naproxen, rather than adverse effects of Vioxx. Researchers led by epidemiologist Wayne Ray of the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine in Nashville suspected otherwise. Their initial study, which examined patients on naproxen and other drugs of the same class, known as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, found no evidence of a cardioprotective effect 3 . But a direct examination of the risks posed by Vioxx, conducted by a collaboration including Ray's team, and led by FDA researcher David Graham, wasn't published until 2005. The study 4  suggested that up to 140,000 excess cases of serious coronary heart disease \u2014 resulting, Graham says, in at least 26,000 deaths \u2014 could have occurred in the United States while Vioxx was on the market. But this required painstaking effort to decide which patients to include in the comparisons, examining such variables as existing cardiovascular disease and arthritis. The project drew on the skills of a cardiologist, a rheumatologist and a statistician. \u201cYou have to have all these experts who can bring their knowledge to bear,\u201d says Ray. \u201cIt might take a few months to do the computer runs, but it takes many, many months of careful thought going into it beforehand.\u201d  Such difficulties are compounded by a dearth of support for pharmacoepidemiological studies. \u201cThe frustration is that we have the technology, but there is very little funding for carrying out these studies,\u201d says Brian Strom, an epidemiologist at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine in Philadelphia. US government agencies don't provide significant funding for such studies. The FDA's Office of Drug Safety, which is responsible for monitoring and assessing the safety of existing drugs, has extremely limited funding for epidemiological studies of its own. A small programme at the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality allocates just $5 million for drug-safety surveillance studies \u2014 a fraction of the roughly $450 million it costs on average to do the clinical trials on a single drug before it can be brought to market. Aside from funding for more studies of drug safety, the main need is to develop clinical databases that pharmacoepidemiologists can readily query to test their hunches about adverse drug events. These need to incorporate full records of patients' medical history, including any hospitalizations and the medicines they were prescribed. The largest such database is the UK General Practice Research Database, which contains over 2.5 million patient records. It is a product of Britain's nationalized healthcare system, in which family doctors are patients' first point of contact. This database has proved successful, for instance, in confirming fears that antidepressants might trigger suicidal behaviour in some patients 5 . But ideally researchers want to extend studies to the United States, where drugs are typically approved earlier, and are taken up more quickly by larger numbers of patients. \n               Separate sources \n             Here, the problem is that such data are collated by individual Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs), such as the California-based Kaiser Permanente, whose database was used for Graham's Vioxx study. Integrating these databases, and ensuring that the data they contain have common definitions and formats, would create a powerful resource for observational studies \u2014 but it is a major challenge. \u201cIntegration is probably the biggest stumbling block,\u201d says Donald Berry, who chairs the Department of Biostatistics and Applied Mathematics at the M. D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, Texas. Nevertheless, some attempts at database integration are now getting off the ground. Eric Larson, director of the Center for Health Studies in Seattle, part of the non-profit Group Health Cooperative, is developing the Coordinated Clinical Studies Network. Involving 13 HMOs around the United States, the aim is to create an integrated data \u2018warehouse\u2019 containing clinical information on up to 18 million people, initially focusing on cardiovascular disease. The three-year project began in November 2004 and has been funded to the tune of $2.7 million by the National Institutes of Health. Even with the funding hurdle cleared, other problems might hamper this ambitious initiative. The biggest difficulty is the lack of will to carry out this project, says Larson. For people working in private sector HMOs, devoting up to three years to setting up a network, rather than actually using it, is a daunting prospect. \u201cThis is a labour of public service,\u201d says Larson. \n                     http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/434554a \n                   \n                     http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/433790b \n                   \n                     http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/432537a \n                   \n                     http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/nrd1629 \n                   \n                     http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/nrd1560 \n                   \n                     http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/nrd1689 \n                   \n                     http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/nrd1517 \n                   \n                     Centers for Education and Research on Therapeutics \n                   \n                     General Practice Research Database \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

But one killer has been largely ignored for decades. Now, thanks to worries about bioterror, it is being taken more seriously. Peter Aldhous reports. Mention melioidosis in most circles \u2014 even those with a passing interest in tropical medicine \u2014 and you'll be met with blank stares. The infection is often misdiagnosed because the bacterium that causes it, the soil-dwelling  Burkholderia pseudomallei , triggers multiple symptoms that mimic those of other diseases. In parts of Asia where  B. pseudomallei  is endemic, this serial killer often commits its crimes without even being identified as a suspect. Not so in Ubon Ratchathani, a bustling provincial capital in northeast Thailand. For Wipada Chaowagul, a specialist in internal medicine at the city's Sappasitprasong Hospital, melioidosis is public enemy number one. Each year, the hospital admits about 200 people who test positive for  B. pseudomallei . Up to half of them die. Chaowagul's patients are mostly rice farmers. When the rains come each year, between May and October,  B. pseudomallei  threatens anyone paddling in the flooded paddy fields that surround Ubon \u2014 especially those already weakened by other conditions such as diabetes. Some develop internal abscesses or inflamed joints; others have difficulty breathing. Many are overwhelmed by the infection, and die from septic shock within 48 hours. Chaowagul wants to run clinical trials of new antibiotics, to see if they can reduce this toll. But for Thailand's overstretched healthcare system, such drugs are prohibitively expensive. No pharmaceutical company has volunteered to donate its products, so Chaowagul's plans remain stalled. \u201cIf we use our own money, we have a problem,\u201d she says. \n               In from the cold \n             This tale is echoed for \u2018orphan\u2019 diseases across the developing world \u2014 unless pathogens afflict rich Westerners, they tend to attract little research money. But  B. pseudomallei  may soon lose its orphan status, thanks to fears that it might be used as a biological weapon. Through its richly funded biodefence initiative, the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) is now encouraging microbiologists to begin working on the bacterium. \u201cWe're looking at building a research base,\u201d says Michael Schaefer, an official at the NIAID's headquarters in Bethesda, Maryland. There are many puzzles to solve.  Burkholderia pseudomallei  is a resilient organism, able to hunker down in the soil or inside the cells of its human victims for years on end, only emerging when conditions favour its growth. One US Vietnam veteran, probably infected after breathing in aerosols of  B. pseudomallei  whipped up by helicopters, first became sick 26 years later. Vanaporn Wuthiekanun, who works on  B. pseudomallei  in the Wellcome Trust unit at Mahidol University in Bangkok, has cultured the bacterium from a sample kept in distilled water for a decade. \u201cIt's very tough,\u201d she observes. For the most part,  B. pseudomallei  is thought to get its nutrition from rotting organic matter, and when the opportunity arises, by parasitizing soil-dwelling amoebae. Its ability to infect human cells may simply be an unhappy consequence of the mechanisms that allow it to do the latter. But these mechanisms are poorly understood, as are the ecological factors that influence  B. pseudomallei 's distribution across the tropics. One mystery is why it is absent in central Thailand \u2014 where it is replaced by its cousin, the harmless  B. thailandensis . \u201cIt's probably something to do with the soil, but we haven't worked it out yet,\u201d says Nick Day, who heads the Wellcome Trust's Bangkok unit. As if the scientific challenges weren't enough, researchers out in the field also face obstacles imposed by southeast Asia's history of conflict. \u201cWe're keen to do soil surveys in Cambodia, but we're afraid of the landmines,\u201d says Wirongrong Chierakul, who works in Day's unit. From the limited information available, it is clear that  B. pseudomallei  is present in the soil in parts of Asia that record few cases of melioidosis. Almost certainly, this is because of inadequate medical diagnosis. \u201cThe distribution of cases tends to follow the distribution of decent microbiology labs, of which there are remarkably few,\u201d says Day. In places where melioidosis has been recognized as an important public-health issue, the priority is finding more effective treatments. Having evolved to compete in the soil with organisms that secrete antibacterial compounds,  B. pseudomallei  is resistant to many drugs. Until the mid-1980s, melioidosis was treated in Thailand with a cocktail of four conventional antibiotics. Only about one in five patients pulled through. That was when Chaowagul teamed up with Nick White, who now directs the Wellcome Trust's southeast Asia programme, but was then heading up its Bangkok unit. The trust, Britain's largest biomedical research charity, has a long-standing interest in tropical diseases, and so agreed to launch a clinical trial to test a newer antibiotic, called ceftazidime. It halved the death rate 1 . The drug's high cost posed a problem, but has since been lowered. \u201cIf you have the results of a trial, you can create a political snowball,\u201d says Day. \u201cVery often the prices will come down.\u201d \n               Drug shortage \n             But Chaowagul still loses more than 40% of her patients. So she and White next turned to a class of antibiotics called the carbapenems, which in lab tests seemed to be effective against  B. pseudomallei 2 . But carbapenems are even more expensive than ceftazidime, and manufacturers were reluctant to donate them for trials. It wasn't until 1994 that White won a supply of a drug called imipenem from the US-based giant Merck, after writing a personal letter to Roy Vagelos, the company's chief executive. The initial trial yielded encouraging but inconclusive results. Although there were fewer treatment failures than for ceftazidime, the sample size was too small to confirm whether the death rate was reduced 3 . The researchers wanted to press ahead with a larger study. But by then Vagelos had left Merck, and White's requests for further donations of imipenem fell on deaf ears. With the drug costing about US$100 per patient, per day, the trial was doomed. \u201cWe just couldn't afford it,\u201d says White. Allen Cheng, a clinician at the Menzies School of Health Research in Darwin, Australia, recounts similar difficulties. He is running a trial in Ubon to see whether Thai melioidosis patients are helped by granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (GCSF), a signalling molecule that can boost the production of white blood cells. \u201cThis is virtually a self-funded project,\u201d says Cheng. The firms he approached showed little interest. Melioidosis is also a local problem in northern Australia. There, GCSF is used routinely, and the death rate has been reduced to less than 20%. But it's unclear whether similar results could be achieved in Thailand. Australian melioidosis patients are rushed into intensive care. But in Ubon, those infected with  B. pseudomallei  must take their chances on overcrowded general wards. At least the melioidosis patients get beds near to the nursing stations. Those with less serious conditions are jammed into corridors, on balconies and outside the elevators. Against this gloomy background, the NIAID's biodefence initiative has provided a beacon of hope.  Burkholderia pseudomallei  has not yet been used as a biological weapon, but its close relative,  B. mallei , was used as a biological agent in the First World War. It causes glanders, a disease that kills horses and, more rarely, people. The bacterium was spread by German troops in an attempt to disable the Russian army's horses and mules. \n               Potent weapon \n             Given the potential for  B. pseudomallei  and  B. mallei  to be deployed by bioterrorists, the NIAID is keen to promote research on both, and last August held a meeting in Bethesda to kick-start interest. Those who have for years ploughed a lonely furrow in melioidosis research can scarcely believe the shift in gear. \u201cTwo or three years ago, no one else was working on this disease in North America,\u201d says Donald Woods, a microbiologist at the University of Calgary in Alberta, Canada. \u201cNow there are ten labs.\u201d The time is right for an influx of money and personnel. Last year saw the publication of the complete genome sequence of  B. pseudomallei 4 , a product of the Wellcome Trust's enthusiasm for tropical medicine and genomics. It appeared next to another paper 5  describing the genome of  B. mallei  \u2014 a project backed by the NIAID. The two sequences should provide clues for researchers trying to understand the organisms' virulence, and suggest targets for drug development. The genome projects have also revealed that  B. mallei  evolved directly from  B. pseudomallei , losing parts of its genome along the way 6 . For clinicians, this close relationship is encouraging. With funding from the US military and the Canadian government, Woods has developed a vaccine against glanders. In December, he began tests to see whether it can prevent horses from becoming infected with  B. mallei . If the results are positive, Woods has high hopes that the vaccine will also protect people against melioidosis. Maybe so, but those who have struggled to launch clinical studies in Thailand are unsure about the extent to which the biodefence bonanza will yield tangible benefits for them and their patients. For Cheng, one question overrides all others: \u201cHow do we stop people dying?\u201d NIAID officials say that the initial focus will be on basic research. But their goal is to use this knowledge to develop improved diagnostic tools, treatments and vaccines. And Schaefer says that the agency will consider funding clinical trials, if a strong case can be made. \u201cThe scope of the biodefence effort is very broad,\u201d he says. \n                     http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/nj6986-966a \n                   \n                     http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/426598a \n                   \n                     http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/424010a \n                   \n                     Melioidosis factsheet \n                   \n                     Wellcome Trust Southeast Asia Programme \n                   \n                     NIAID meeting on glanders and melioidosis \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

As the political pressure mounts, Meredith Wadman joins the agency's hunt for a remedy to its ills. A telling scene unfolded in the lobby of a suburban Maryland hotel on 18 February. On the third and final day of a gruelling public conference, expert advisers to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) held in their hands the fates of three blockbuster painkillers, known as COX-2 inhibitors. To make their assessment, the experts had to balance the drugs' value in treating arthritis against mounting evidence that they cause heart attacks and strokes. Billions of dollars in revenues for drug companies \u2014 and the welfare of millions of patients \u2014 hung in the balance. But when a mid-morning break was called and the 32 advisers wandered out for coffee, they were largely ignored by the throng of reporters at the event. Instead, the journalists clustered around a boyish-looking FDA scientist who was holding forth for a television camera. They plied him with questions about his views on the issues before the panel, diligently jotting down his every response. In the middle of the media scrum was David Graham, a career physician at the FDA. Graham came to public prominence last November at a US Senate hearing, when he pronounced his employer \u201cincapable\u201d of ensuring the safety of drugs after they were approved for sale in the United States. His scathing testimony set alarm bells ringing on Capitol Hill and raised some fundamental questions about the FDA: is the agency scientifically, structurally or politically capable of ensuring the safety of some 10,000 pharmaceuticals now used by Americans? Or has the complexity, size and pace of the business, and the power of the drug manufacturers, exceeded the regulator's ability to cope? Graham had told senators on 18 November that just one of the COX-2 inhibitors \u2014 Vioxx \u2014 had caused at least 26,000 deaths from heart attacks in the five years before Merck withdrew it from the market last September. An epidemiologist in the FDA's Office of Drug Safety, Graham had conducted a study using the massive database of Kaiser Permanente, a health-maintenance organization based in California. Last August, armed with its results, he warned his bosses that high doses of Vioxx significantly increased the risk of heart attack and sudden death. The agency did not act \u2014 and even approved the drug's use in children with rheumatoid arthritis in the weeks before Merck withdrew it. The FDA's Office of New Drugs \u2014 where any new medicine must pass muster before it can be sold \u2014 approved Vioxx in 1999. It was heavily promoted by Merck as an alternative to standard arthritis medications because it didn't cause stomach bleeding, and it soon became a huge success, with worldwide sales of $2.5 billion in 2003 alone. Then, last September, a Merck-sponsored trial examining whether the pill might prevent precancerous colon tumours found that Vioxx doubled the risk of heart attacks and strokes in patients using it for more than 18 months. Critics \u2014 including plaintiffs in the raft of lawsuits against Merck that swiftly followed the drug's withdrawal \u2014 complained that as early as 1999, studies had flagged Vioxx's potential for causing heart attacks and strokes. They implied that the FDA should have identified the problem and pulled the medicine from the market. In his Senate testimony, Graham endorsed that point of view. He added that Vioxx was probably far from a one-off event. It was bound to repeat itself, he said, because the FDA's organizational structure and corporate culture were biased towards approval of new drugs. Safety monitoring of drugs already out there, he said, took second place. Graham further complained that the reviewers at the Office of New Drugs who approve therapeutics in the first place have a vested interest in the drugs' success, and are liable to ignore or overrule post-market safety concerns raised by staff scientists in the smaller Office of Drug Safety. Asked to identify other established drugs about which he had serious safety reservations, Graham named five, including Pfizer's Bextra, another COX-2 inhibitor. \u201cThe FDA as currently configured,\u201d he concluded, \u201cis incapable of protecting America against another Vioxx. We are virtually defenceless.\u201d \n               Rapid response \n             The initial congressional response was swift and emphatic. Senator Chuck Grassley (Republican, Iowa), chairman of the Senate Committee on Finance where Graham testified, chided the FDA for ignoring danger signals and failing to heed the warnings of its own scientists. Senator Michael Enzi (Republican, Wyoming), who chairs another Senate committee with direct jurisdiction over the FDA, scolded its officials at a hearing earlier this month saying that \u201cdoing nothing to address the current controversies is not an option\u201d. Grassley is shortly expected to introduce legislation, together with Senator Christopher Dodd (Democrat, Connecticut), that would boost the power and autonomy of the Office of Drug Safety. Yet top FDA officials say that the agency's performance remains strong. \u201cThe safety of the drug supply right now is better than it has ever been,\u201d says Janet Woodcock, the FDA's acting deputy commissioner for operations, who from 1994 to 2004 ran the agency's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER), which houses both the Office of New Drugs and the Office of Drug Safety. Woodcock argues that some agency critics fail to understand that risk and benefit are inextricably linked for any drug \u2014 and that calls to assess one without the other betray this basic misunderstanding. The point, she says, isn't that some drugs with risky side effects shouldn't be approved, but that their risks and benefits need to be carefully weighed both by the regulatory authorities who first approve them and by the physicians and patients who ultimately use them. And despite the wave of bad publicity that shrouded the FDA last winter, its public image remains fairly healthy. For decades, polls have suggested that its public approval hovers at the heady level \u2014 for a government agency \u2014 of about 75%. And a February survey of 1,200 people by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that 77% thought the agency was doing a reasonable job of ensuring drug safety. Nonetheless, by almost any measure, the past year has been a rocky one for the FDA. In March 2004, Mark McClellan decamped after just 17 months from a commissioner's position that had sat vacant for nearly two years prior to his arrival. Soon after that, the agency came under fire for suppressing the report of a staff scientist who cautioned that popular \u2018SSRI\u2019 antidepressants could cause suicidal tendencies in young people. And in early October, just a few days after Merck withdrew Vioxx, the FDA's competence in ensuring the safety of vaccines destined for the US market was called into question when British authorities abruptly closed a flu vaccine plant in Liverpool owned by US company Chiron. This halved the United States' supply of vaccine for the coming winter and provoked a public uproar. David Kessler, who ran the agency from 1990 to 1997 and is now dean of the medical school at the University of California, San Francisco, thinks that the cumulative impact of events has been considerable. \u201cIt certainly began to shake confidence, not only in the public but within the medical community,\u201d Kessler says. \u201cFor the first time, I have physician colleagues asking me if they can believe what the FDA is saying.\u201d \n               Full stretch \n             Some of the 1,600 scientists and physicians who work at the CDER privately admit that they are stretched to fulfil the agency's mission. With an average annual salary of $128,000, many are forsaking more lucrative careers in the private sector \u2014 often because they find FDA work satisfying and valuable. \u201cI tell my kids I have one of the most interesting jobs in the world,\u201d says Rachel Behrman, a physician who began working as a drug reviewer in 1989 and is now deputy director of the CDER's Office of Medical Policy. \u201cAnd I go to bed every night thinking I've done something important.\u201d But the current crises, combined with the fact that 30% of the FDA's work force is eligible for retirement over the next five years, has agency-watchers worried that retention of high-quality staff is going to become a tough challenge. \u201cIf we continue to pound and beat up on the agency, we are going to lose very good people,\u201d says Kessler. Worries about the pressure on FDA staff surfaced in 2002, when the Government Accountability Office assessed the impact of a 1992 law that introduced industry fees to pay for speedier drug reviews. It found that the law had boosted reviewer workloads, cut their training and resulted in annual attrition rates among FDA scientists of about 10% \u2014 roughly twice the level found at the National Institutes of Health or the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. And a survey of 400 FDA scientists conducted for another 2002 government study \u2014 but not published until December 2004, when it was accessed by the Union of Concerned Scientists under the Freedom of Information Act \u2014 found a group of people seriously concerned about the agency's ability to protect the public from dangerous side effects in approved drugs. In that survey, 19% said that they were \u201cnot confident at all\u201d in the FDA's ability to monitor the safety of drugs once they are on the market; only 6% were \u201ccompletely confident\u201d in that ability. And 18% said that they had been pressured to approve new drugs despite reservations about their safety, efficacy or quality. \n               Testing times \n             The COX-2 controversy has left some observers asking whether the CDER, with an annual budget of about $500 million, has the resources to police a prescription drugs market that is now worth more than $160 billion annually in the United States. Some also argue that the FDA lacks the legal authority it needs to monitor established drugs. Before a drug is approved, the onus rests on the manufacturer to demonstrate its safety and efficacy. Once the FDA approves a medicine for marketing, that balance shifts. The agency can ask \u2014 but not require \u2014 companies to pay for and conduct post-market safety studies; and it cannot limit the use of a drug to particular medical subspecialities, as it can with medical devices. Nor does it have explicit authority to beef up warnings on drug labels. Instead, it negotiates label changes in often-protracted discussions with manufacturers. In the case of Vioxx, a change to the label to include a \u201cprecaution\u201d about the risk of heart attack at high doses took 18 months for the agency to negotiate with Merck. That kind of outcome begs for additional legal muscle for the FDA, says William Schultz, a Washington lawyer who was the agency's deputy commissioner for policy in the mid-1990s. \u201cIt's the post-market piece that really needs the attention,\u201d he says. \u201cPatients have got to realize how little we know when a drug goes on the market.\u201d There are other thorny problems in ensuring post-market safety. The FDA, for example, doesn't set out systematically to monitor dangerous side effects. Instead, it relies on a reactive, \u2018passive\u2019 reporting system in which doctors report possible cases of side effects only when it occurs to them that a particular ailment may be the reaction to a drug. The system, by its nature, will seldom detect dangerous side effects that are already common in the population, such as the heart attacks and strokes prompted by the COX-2 inhibitors (see  page 557 ). It is thought that the 400,000-odd reports that the FDA gets in this way each year represent only a small fraction of actual adverse events. Then there is the fact that the 1992 law that instituted industry-paid fees did so on the condition that the FDA met tight drug-review timelines and otherwise boosted performance standards. To achieve this \u2014 and so keep hundreds of millions of dollars in industry fees flowing into the agency \u2014 the drug centre was forced to raid other budgets. The upshot: in President Bush's proposed 2006 budget, new-drug review consumes roughly 80% of the CDER's budget; only about 6% of it is designated for post-market surveillance. The 1992 law \u201csapped resources from other very needed areas, away from drug safety, away from compliance\u201d, says Kessler. Post-market monitoring \u201cabsolutely needs more resources. You can't just have resources go into new drug review\u201d, he adds. \n               Independent thought \n             In at least some quarters on Capitol Hill, that message is being heard. The bill being drawn up by Grassley and Dodd would create a fully funded Center for Drug Safety independent of the CDER with authority to demand label changes from drugmakers. \u201cIt doesn't make sense to have the office that reviews the safety of drugs under the thumb of the office that puts the drugs on the market in the first place,\u201d Grassley told the Consumer Federation of America last month. Acting FDA commissioner Lester Crawford, who has been nominated by President Bush for the permanent post, told senators at his nomination hearing on 17 March that he is \u201copen to discussing\u201d an independent office of drug safety. Crawford has also announced that a new board for overseeing drug safety \u2014 an advisory board of mainly FDA employees \u2014 will publicize worrisome side effects more quickly than has happened in the past. Critics immediately assailed the board as toothless, because it will lack the power to require label changes or to pull drugs from the market. But Crawford says that it will herald a new era of public openness at the agency. Still, some agency-watchers fear that the relatively low profile of Crawford's nomination and confirmation process, together with the reluctance of the conservative Congress to antagonize its allies in industry, suggest that even the tens of thousands of deaths attributed to Vioxx may be insufficient to initiate any real strengthening of the FDA. The agency's history demonstrates that \u201cmajor changes come after disasters\u201d, says Schultz. And the Vioxx case may not rise to that threshold in the public mind. At the end of the three-day advisory panel meeting back in February, the experts voted narrowly to allow Vioxx back onto the market, subject to careful constraints. They also voted to give patients continued access to Pfizer's two COX-2 inhibitors, Celebrex and Bextra. Graham, for one, was not impressed. \u201cDespite the biggest drug-safety catastrophe in the history of the United States,\u201d he noted with his trademark earnestness, \u201cpeople are heavily invested in the status quo.\u201d \n                     http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/434557a \n                   \n                     http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/432537a \n                   \n                     http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/430815b \n                   \n                     http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/430954a \n                   \n                     David Graham's testimony \n                   \n                     Vioxx withdrawal \n                   \n                     Kaiser Family Foundation February 2005 public opinion survey: \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

But the world's biggest dust source was until recently a war zone. Jim Giles joins one of the few research teams to make the trip.  Midday, near Chicha, northern Chad. It's the dustiest time of day in the dustiest place on Earth. A dirty-white haze drifts in through the open windows of the jeep, coating our clothes with powder. Outside, in the 40 \u00b0C heat, there's an argument going on. Adrian Chappell and Charlie Bristow have come a very long way, to a place where no one else wants to be, to have their dispute: the Bod\u00e9l\u00e9 depression, a low-lying region on the eastern fringe of the Sahara. Almost nothing grows here, amid the dunes, gravelly ground and the great plumes of dust that blot out the Sun. Even the local desert people avoid the area. But it's confusion, not discomfort, that is causing Earth scientists Chappell and Bristow to disagree. After three hot and bumpy days of driving from Chad's capital, N'Djamena, they find themselves in a desert with a surprisingly compact, crusty surface. We're covered in dust, yet it's not clear how the very solid ground we're standing on can produce the clouds that surround us. This simple and surprising observation will be the source of much discussion over the next two weeks. The team of seven scientists \u2014 one of the few groups of researchers ever to visit the Bod\u00e9l\u00e9 \u2014 will see their tents buried by dust storms, become accustomed to digging jeeps out of the sand, and develop a taste for goat stew and roast gazelle \u2014 the only fare in this barren land. Their efforts will also shed light on one of the major players in Earth's climate. Dust affects storm formation and cloud cover, and provides minerals that fertilize the ocean and jungles thousands of kilometres away. \u201cFeatures like the Bod\u00e9l\u00e9 turn out to be of planetary significance,\u201d says team member Richard Washington of the University of Oxford, UK. And yet little is known about exactly how much dust is produced, by what mechanism, and how much of an effect it has on the planet. So perhaps it's no surprise that Chappell, of the University of Salford, and Bristow, from Birkbeck College, London, are now troubled by what seems an easy question \u2014 just what causes the Bod\u00e9l\u00e9 to pump out dust at such a phenomenal rate? The pair climb back in the jeep and put their debate on hold until dinner that evening. The seven-man team is camping nearby at Chicha, a place that is little more than a name on the map. Sights: one tree \u2014 the only one for tens of kilometres \u2014 and several pieces of abandoned weaponry. Apparent population: several dung beetles and one yellow snake.  The Bod\u00e9l\u00e9 was not always like this. Our camp would once have been submerged under Lake Megachad, a vast expanse of freshwater that stretched across much of the country, supporting numerous human communities on its shores. Six thousand years ago the lake receded south, and the people went with it. Today's travellers sometimes stumble across the remains of those long-gone settlements. On one trip we spy a pile of pottery fragments jumbled up with alligator bones, suggesting that an ancient Bod\u00e9lian made a meal for the reptile (or vice versa). Later we find a human jawbone and a skull protruding from the gravelly ground, and we duly record their location for future study. \u201cThese people probably died around six thousand years ago,\u201d says Andrew Warren, an Earth scientist from University College London. \u201cIt's not inconceivable that we are the next people to come by.\u201d \n               Wind tunnel \n             To the northeast of the remains lies the geographical feature that makes the Bod\u00e9l\u00e9 so dusty: a gap between two mountain ranges that funnels winds onto the chalky-white desert. The ground here is not made up of sand or rock, but diatomite \u2014 the ground-up remains of microscopic freshwater creatures that once thrived in Lake Megachad. Judging from satellite photographs, most of the Bod\u00e9l\u00e9 is covered with this material. And those same pictures show that the wind kicks up clouds of diatomite dust that can stretch for up to 700 kilometres. Unlike other dust sources on the planet, the area seems to be active year-round, making it the largest single source of dust (see  \u2018Measuring up\u2019 ). This can make life unpleasant in nearby N'Djamena, but dust and other airborne particles have much longer-range effects as well. Only over the past few decades have scientists begun to realize the range of dust's impact on the climate. They now know that aerosols such as mineral dust can reflect light from the Sun, cooling the land beneath. Particulate matter also encourages cloud formation, which again tends to reflect light back into space. But other aerosols \u2014 particularly carbon from fire and industry \u2014 absorb sunlight, heating the atmosphere but not the surface. Combine these effects, and it seems that the overall impact of particulates is to cool the Earth, reining in the temperature increase caused by greenhouse gases. Yet our understanding of these effects is primitive and the uncertainties great \u2014 so great, in fact, that climate scientists cannot rule out the possibility that aerosols have an opposite and unwelcome heating effect. But while dust has increasingly occupied the minds of researchers, no climate scientist has been to the Bod\u00e9l\u00e9 before now. It is easy to see why. A few kilometres away from our camp lies an unexploded bomb, its plump body and tail fin slanting upwards from the sand. We also find a Soviet-made jeep equipped with a rocket launcher, the armour pierced by bullet holes. Libya and Chad fought for this area during the 1980s, one of many conflicts to have derailed Chad's development since it gained independence from France in 1960. Even now the area is turbulent. To the north, the Tibesti mountains remain off-limits due to landmines. East of us, fighting in the Darfur region of Sudan has spilled across the border. And Africa's deserts are often lawless places anyway. When we camped on the way to Chicha, our guides searched for a hollow away from the road \u2014 any lights at night could attract the attention of bandits. Now here, the priorities for the climate researchers are working out which weather conditions produce dust, and how much sunlight that dust reflects. On arrival, Martin Todd of University College London and Samuel Mbainayel of the Department of Water Resources and Meteorology in N'Djamena, erect a weather station close to camp. That's complemented by a computer-controlled device, which will track the strength of the sunlight reaching the ground. \n               Up, up and away \n             Towards the end of the first day, as the heat recedes a little, Washington and his Oxford colleague Sebastian Engelstaedter begin a somewhat lower-tech experiment. The budget for the trip is extraordinarily tight \u2014 the main source of funding is a single grant of just \u00a312,000 (US$22,500) from the Royal Geographical Society in London. So when Washington and Engelstaedter decided to map wind patterns by tracking the motion of helium-filled balloons, they were forced to improvise to cut costs.  Researchers usually follow the balloons by attaching electric bulbs and batteries and tracking them at night. But with more than 100 flights planned, this was beyond the pair's resources. Instead, Washington and Engelstaedter attach plastic cups containing candles to their balloons \u2014 they tested this system back in Oxford by driving around town holding the cups and candles out of the window of their car, to check that they wouldn't blow out. It turns out to work reasonably well; they manage to track the balloons for around 10 minutes, about half the time achievable using electric lights. As someone who has spent the past 15 years of his holidays criss-crossing the Sahara in a 1960s Land Rover, Washington is undaunted by the prospect of spending two weeks at Chicha. But the others are less enamoured by the idea. On our second day in camp, the winds are strong by midday, raising a gritty cloud that obscures the horizon and gets into mouths and eyes. Laptop keyboards have to be covered with clingfilm. And when the temperature hits 40 \u00b0C by mid-afternoon, the team is forced to retreat to what the group has dubbed the \u2018University of the Bod\u00e9l\u00e9\u2019: a tent containing camping chairs and a car stereo for entertainment. Such weather isn't pleasant, but it's great for data collection. While the researchers huddle in tents, the information being gathered outside will help answer some basic questions with far-reaching impacts. It will determine how the size of the Bod\u00e9l\u00e9 dust cloud varies with wind speed, for example, and how much sunlight the plume reflects. Although satellite pictures have given a good indication of the relative dustiness of this desert, this is no substitute for data gathered from the ground. Armed with this information, modellers will be able to include the conditions and processes special to the Bod\u00e9l\u00e9 in their simulations for the first time. The end result could have dramatic effects on predictions of extreme weather events \u2014 some of them on the other side of the globe. Across the Atlantic in Florida, for example, hurricanes batter the coast almost every summer, running up bills of billions of dollars. The hurricanes form from seedling storms off the west coast of Africa, and over the past few years researchers have discovered that hurricane risk is much reduced if the storm runs into dry and dusty air from the Sahara.  If researchers could watch the formation of seedling storms and dust clouds, and better forecast whether they may collide, hurricane prediction is likely to improve, giving extra days of warning to those on the US east coast. \u201cWe're catching hurricanes downstream now,\u201d says Jason Dunion, a hurricane researcher at the Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory in Miami, Florida. \u201cWe've got to get to grips with the start of the process.\u201d \n               Diatomite dunes \n             But for the researchers out in the Bod\u00e9l\u00e9, the start of that process is proving perplexing. Before the trip, they had guessed that the Bod\u00e9l\u00e9 was covered in talcum-powder fine deposits of diatomite. Washington has seen similar diatomite fields elsewhere in the Sahara and the team assumed that the lightweight particles could easily be whipped up into dust clouds. Wind alone will not do that \u2014 smooth air flow will flatten out and then pass over the top of fine deposits \u2014 although sand blown in from the surrounding desert could provide the necessary kick. When we drive out in search of diatomite deposits, armed with Global Positioning System handsets and the satellite imagery as a guide, we find plenty of it, but none of it is in powder form. The white sediments are gravelly in some places, hard and chalky in others. The three Earth scientists find it difficult to fathom how even the most violent sand streams could generate dust. \u201cYou'd need an electric sander,\u201d says Chappell. Over that evening's goat stew, the three bat around possible explanations. Bristow suggests that large particles of diatomite might collect in crescent-shaped mounds called barkhan dunes, which march slowly across the desert, blown along a few metres every year. As the wind forces grains up the gentle slope of each dune, from where they plummet off the sharp edge at the top and down the protruding horns, the particles would be constantly rubbing and grinding against each other. This continual motion might break the chunks of diatomite into particles light enough to blow off the edge of the dune and into the air.  It's a good theory, but a radical one for the field. Most of the world's dust is produced by wind-driven sand bouncing over the top of dusty deposits. And barkhan dunes made from quartz sand are common in deserts, but no one has ever seen one made out of diatomite. As the rest of the camp heads to bed, most sleeping outside to enjoy the cool night, the three are still deep in debate. But the next day we drive up to a greyish dune and discover that it is not simply coated in a fine layer of diatomite. A sample shows that it seems to be diatomite throughout, made up of chunks of particles of different sizes. \u201cIt's extraordinary,\u201d says Warren, whose 40-year career has taken him to many Saharan countries. \u201cI don't know of anywhere else with dunes like this.\u201d As the wind picks up, we can clearly see that dust is being blown off the crest of these dunes and that the air is clearer where there are fewer dunes. Chappell and I drive out the following day to set up an experiment that might settle the issue. Around a grey barkhan we set up ten poles, each armed with three bottles to collect sand and dust at different heights. Six poles are planted up the gentle upwind slope of the dune; four are sited off the downwind side. It's sweaty work and Chappell aims to plant 60 in all. Unexpected hitches cause further perspiration: when our vehicle becomes stuck, we shovel sand in the midday sun for an hour to free it. At first, the weather is on Chappell's side. Thanks to a wind-free period, he plants poles around three dunes and the space around them in just a few days. But when the calm, clear spell continues, he and the others become worried. Chappell's experiment won't produce much data on quiet days. And the climate scientists want to experience the worst the Bod\u00e9l\u00e9 can throw at them, so they can study the weather conditions that generate the huge dust clouds. Back in London, I check the daily satellite imagery from the comfort of my office. And come the middle of their second week in the Bod\u00e9l\u00e9, a huge plume appears. \u201cIt's a beast,\u201d Washington tells me by satellite phone. Tents were flattened and covered in sand overnight, sending the inhabitants fleeing to the jeeps at 2 in the morning. The next day, the team had to don ski goggles and masks. Out on the diatomite dunes, it was impossible to distinguish dunes from sky from ground. \u201cIt's like flying a plane on instruments,\u201d says Chappell. \n               Flakes and balls \n             But the data from those last few days, which the team is now analysing back in Britain, will make the trip worthwhile. Washington and Todd are just beginning their analysis, but they are already sure that the wind speeds needed to produce dust in the Bod\u00e9l\u00e9 are higher than thought. \u201cThings start getting going at around 12\u201315 metres per second,\u201d says Washington. \u201cA gentle breeze can produce dust elsewhere in the Sahara.\u201d Bristow's theory about dust generation seems to be largely correct. The high winds seen at the end of the trip may release dust as they blow pellets of diatomite across the flat ground, he says, but most of the dust is being generated by flakes and balls of diatomite that grind against each other as the wind pushes them up and over dunes. Chappell's data provide further confirmation. He sees more dust farther up dunes than at the bottom, and notes that the concentration of dust drops off exponentially with height above the dune tops \u2014 a pattern characteristic of a dust source. Back in his lab in Salford, Chappell has also produced the first estimate of how fast dust flows from the Bod\u00e9l\u00e9. Although the team witnessed just one major storm, the data collected revealed that an average of 40 mg of dust passed every square metre every second during that period \u2014 an emission rate that matches the highest recorded anywhere in the world. So the satellite images that identified the Bod\u00e9l\u00e9 as such an important dust source seem to have proven a trusty guide. Those images can now be compared with real data from the ground \u2014 and researchers who could not join the trip are eager to get started. \u201cAll of us who look at satellite photographs are fascinated with that place,\u201d says Joseph Prospero, an expert on dust at the University of Miami in Florida. \u201cWe want to know what makes it that way.\u201d Thanks to the team from \u2018the University of the Bod\u00e9l\u00e9\u2019 they seem to be getting their wish. \n                     Bod\u00e9l\u00e9 team's results \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

The only problem was they were fake. Haim Watzman unearths the authentication work that has rocked Israel's archaeology community.  At the end of December, five alleged members of an antiquities forgery ring were indicted in Jerusalem's district court. At the same time, the Israel Museum in Jerusalem removed from view one of its most prized pieces: an ivory pomegranate bearing an inscription hinting that it had been used by priests in Solomon's Temple, the holiest site of the Israelite nation in the biblical period. The five men stand accused of forging this and other inscriptions. Behind these events lies a debate between the museum and scientists over how and when archaeological objects should be authenticated. Should a rigorous, scientific, peer-review process have kicked into action over the pomegranate decades ago, when the piece was bought by the museum? Or were the expert opinions solicited by the museum at the time sufficient to justify its purchase \u2014 at a cost of US$550,000? Yuval Goren, chairman of Tel Aviv University's department of archaeology and ancient Near Eastern cultures, and head of the lab that recently investigated the pomegranate, bridges both sides of the debate at the heart of the problem. Is chemical and microscopic analysis the ultimate arbiter of authenticity, or can this be overruled by the work of historians and experts in ancient script? As an archaeologist with training in microscopy, Goren speaks the languages of both the natural and social sciences. At 48 years old, intense and good-looking, Goren could easily be the model for the hero of an archaeological detective series.  Goren and his team were first brought in to look at the pomegranate last year. It was of paramount importance to historians at the time, as it was thought to be a rare piece of solid evidence for the existence of Solomon's Temple. According to the Bible, this temple was built in the tenth century  BC  at the command of God (\u2018Yahweh\u2019 in ancient Hebrew), on a hilltop that is now Islam's third holiest site, holding the Dome of the Rock and the Al-Aqsa mosque. The site's sanctity means that it can't be excavated, and the resulting dearth of direct evidence has led some historians, as well as adversaries of the modern state of Israel, to argue that Solomon's Temple never existed and that the Jewish state thus has no legitimate claim to the sacred hill. The pomegranate's inscription, obliterated in part by a hole in the object, has been reconstructed to read: \u201cBelonging to the Temple of Yahweh, holy to the priests,\u201d in ancient Hebrew. The cream-coloured relic has a hole in the bottom, and the archaeologists who examined it when it first came to light speculated that it was used as the top of a sceptre. Pomegranates, being one of the seven species with which God blessed the Holy Land, according to the Bible, are a common motif in Israelite artefacts. When the Israel Museum bought the piece from an undisclosed owner in the 1980s, curators asked Nahman Avigad, a senior archaeologist at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, to authenticate the object. Avigad and his colleagues examined the piece with a microscope and declared it to be genuine 1 . But by 2003, serious doubts were raised about this conclusion when two other highly publicized objects with biblical associations threw up some surprises. \n               Genuine article? \n             The first of these was a black sandstone tablet, engraved with an inscription in ancient Hebrew remarkably similar to two biblical passages describing temple repairs carried out by King Jehoash of Judah. Three geologists at the Geological Survey of Israel examined this \u2018Jehoash tablet\u2019 in 2002 and determined, through chemical analyses and carbon dating, that the stone and its patina \u2014 the coating that often develops on ancient stone, metal and ceramics through interaction with air or soil \u2014 indicated that the inscription was more than 2,000 years old. They ruled that it was probably a remnant of Solomon's Temple 2 . But when Edward Greenstein, a professor of biblical studies at Tel Aviv University, saw a picture of the tablet in his morning newspaper early in 2003, he quickly came to the conclusion that it was a forgery, and not a very good one. He and other palaeographers \u2014 experts in ancient scripts \u2014 said that some of the word uses were modern rather than ancient, and that in several cases the spelling wasn't right for the time period. \u201cAny one of these howlers would demonstrate the spurious character of the inscription,\u201d wrote Frank Moore Cross, an emeritus professor of Hebrew at Harvard Divinity School in Cambridge, Massachusetts, in the  Israel Exploration Journal 3 . If there was conflict between the natural-science results and the palaeographic results, Greenstein and Cross argued, the natural scientists were wrong. The second object was an ossuary of the type used in Roman times to inter human bones, with an inscription reading \u201cJames son of Joseph brother of Jesus\u201d. In this case some palaeographers and archaeologists declared the item to be authentic whereas others claimed it was a forgery. \n               Out of character \n             More work on these objects was clearly needed. So in 2003, the Israel Antiquities Authority began an investigation. It established two committees, one of humanities experts and one (with Goren as a leading member) of natural scientists. In the case of the Jehoash tablet, Goren issued a scathing critique of the geologists' methods and conclusions 4 . In the analysis he and his colleagues performed, they noted that the patina within the inscription's letters is quite different from that on the back of the tablet. The latter is packed with silicon and strongly attached to the rock surface, he noted, and so is undoubtedly authentic. But the patina in the inscription is a mixture containing chalk, iron-rich clay, charcoal and microscopic globules of gold \u2014 a composition that matches neither the tablet itself nor the rocks and soil of Jerusalem. Goren and his associates concluded that this patina was fake. In the case of the James ossuary, Goren found that the patina in and around the inscription contains coccoliths \u2014 microfossils of tiny marine creatures. Such fossils could not have been transferred to the object from the chalk in the surrounding soil by natural processes, Goren says. Instead, he says, the forgers probably ground up chalk and mixed it into a fake patina. Goren's collaborators also looked at oxygen isotope ratios in the patina, which provide information about the conditions, such as temperature and humidity, in which it formed. They found these ratios to be widely different in the letters themselves compared with elsewhere on the object. Goren and his two co-workers concluded that the patina on the inscription could not have been created in Jerusalem during the past 3,000 years: the inscription, he says, is a recent addition.  The only other possibility is that someone, for some reason, scraped off the real patina and replaced it. This provides an opening for those textual scholars who still maintain that the inscription is real. In June 2003 the committees issued their reports: both objects were forgeries. Most of the humanities scholars agreed, although there are some who still reserve judgement. \n               Tracking the source \n             When suspicions about the objects first arose, police sought them out and found them in the possession of Oded Golan, a private antiquities dealer and one of the five indicted men, who continues to assert that the objects are genuine. He claimed that he was trying to sell the pieces on behalf of their owners, whom he did not identify. In 2003, the antiquities authority and the police asked Goren and others to examine a number of other inscribed objects that had passed through Golan's hands. The Israel Museum set up its own task force, with Goren as a leading member, to examine the prize piece: the pomegranate.  Goren's lab is the opposite of high-tech, containing some microscopes and devices for measuring and cutting tiny portions of potentially valuable objects for study. In the case of the Jehoash tablet and the James ossuary, Goren scraped off tiny amounts of patina using a scalpel, a small chisel and a set of dental tools. He then used microscopic images to help determine the composition and crystalline structure of the object's minerals, revealing where the stone was probably quarried and the conditions under which the patina formed. If needs be, Goren's chemist colleagues can use instruments such as mass spectrometers to determine the exact elemental composition of the material. Goren concluded that although the pomegranate does date to the bronze age \u2014 the period 3300\u20131200  BC  and before Solomon's Temple is believed to have been built \u2014 its inscription is a modern addition. \u201cThe patina is no patina \u2014 it contains only silicon,\u201d Goren says. \u201cFurthermore, whoever wrote the inscription was careful not to cross an ancient fracture in the object. That means the inscription postdates the fracture. It's hard to believe that someone would dedicate a broken pomegranate to the temple,\u201d he says. Michal Dayagi-Mendels, the Israel Museum's chief curator of archaeology, is not happy about the debunking of a prize object that cost the museum half-a-million dollars. But she says that this may be the sad but inevitable consequence of the advancing science of detecting frauds. \u201cTests become more and more sophisticated over the years,\u201d she says. \u201cThe kinds of tests that were done now could not have been done when we made the acquisition.\u201d \n               Letter by letter \n              But Goren disagrees. \u201cThe methods I use are classical methods that everyone uses. They're available and inexpensive,\u201d he asserts. True, he says, the use of the scanning electron microscope, a device that provides high-magnification, high-resolution images without damaging artefacts, is relatively new to archaeological investigations. But this just provides a new way of performing essentially the same analyses that have long been done on such objects. The same results could have been achieved in the 1980s with a conventional microscope, he says, just as his team did for the ossuary and the tablet. Goren argues that forgers manage to dupe curators because museums are often so eager to gain a prize item that they take shortcuts through the scientific process. \u201cIt's not a problem of scientific method but of ethics,\u201d he says. As far as Goren is concerned, the work done on the pomegranate when it was purchased simply wasn't sufficient. Dayagi-Mendels says that more than 90% of the archaeological artefacts owned by the Israel Museum come from documented excavations, which helps immensely in proving authenticity. \u201cIn principle, anything that doesn't come out of an excavation undergoes a series of tests in our own restoration laboratories and, when called for, in external laboratories,\u201d she says. Such objects, as well as excavated objects about which questions arise, undergo further testing over the years, she adds. James Snyder, the museum's director and an art historian by profession, says the procedure followed for the pomegranate's purchase, which was made before his directorship, was perfectly appropriate. \n               Added value \n             It is not practical to run every possible test on every unprovenanced object, notes Paul Craddock, a materials scientist at the British Museum's department of conservation, documentation and science. Craddock, who is now writing a book on fakes and forgeries, emphasizes that the scientists can only seek to answer questions that curators pose for them, based on their expertise and professional intuition. He cites a case in which his museum was offered a bronze water vessel from the medieval period, which was unusually shaped as a unicorn. \u201cWe had to be told that the important bit was the horn. If we'd run our tests on a leg, the object would have been proved genuine,\u201d he says. But with the knowledge that it was the horn that made the object valuable and collectable, he ran an ultraviolet test over that. \u201cIt showed it was a separate piece that had been glued on,\u201d Craddock says. With such guidance, it should be easier for people such as Goren to help sort out the real pieces from the fakes. But there will always be debates about authenticity. The pomegranate, for one, has now become symbolic of such disputes. Snyder and Dayagi-Mendels have decided to put it back on display at the Israel Museum to serve as a lesson to the public. \u201cWe plan to keep it on view and to use it to explain the process of authentication,\u201d Snyder says. \u201cWhat's interesting is that science is illuminating but it is never definitive,\u201d Snyder adds. \u201cMy guess is that in the months to come we will see questions raised about whether the latest conclusions about the pomegranate are definitive.\u201d With new chemical results battling against historical analyses, and in some cases an overwhelming desire to believe that an inscription is real, coming to a truly final conclusion may simply be impossible.

But, as Emma Marris discovers in Florida, the have-nots have had enough.  Seen from the air, Florida's Palm Beach looks like paradise. There's the aquamarine sea, the sandy line of beach studded with palms, the pastel cul-de-sacs with their deep-blue squares. It is only as you descend that you realize that the squares aren't swimming pools, but plastic tarpaulins \u2014 makeshift repairs after last summer's hurricane season. Welcome to the future home of Scripps Florida. Scripps is the state's heavyweight contender in a battle to win promotion to the first division of science. Jeb Bush, the president's brother and governor of Florida, has helped to arrange $310 million in state funding to attract the Scripps Institute in La Jolla, California, to the state. Palm Beach County has promised a further $200 million, including a 777-hectare former orange grove as a site. Will the arrival of Scripps succeed in establishing a premier biomedical research centre and nurturing a string of spin-off biotechnology companies in this playground for the rich, tanned and famous? It's not only a question for Floridians. Other states that fare badly in the carve-up of federal research funds (see map,  Fig. 1 ) will be watching Florida's progress with interest. One way or another, they all want the answer to the same question: is it too late for them to get into the science game? \n               Prestigious start \n             The basic geography of research funding in the United States dates from the system's establishment after the Second World War. Scientists, credited with the development of the atomic bomb, found their prestige at an all-time high, and the agencies set up by federal government to support their work had no hesitation in awarding the lion's share of the money to places where the scientists wanted to live and work. Mostly that meant Ivy League institutions on the east coast, the strong public universities in the midwest, and Stanford and the University of California system in the west. The amount of funds available has since expanded to some $23 billion, which the federal government will this year spend on basic and applied research in universities. Hundreds of less-celebrated institutions have been seeking a share of the spoils, as have state governments such as Florida's. A successful research university is increasingly seen as a route to economic development. States that have traditionally received little research funding hope that building such institutes and encouraging spin-off companies will create high-paying jobs and attract new companies. \u201cWhen a university gets money, the effect is not confined just to that university,\u201d says Daniel Greenberg, a Washington-based journalist and author who has been writing about research policy for decades. \u201cWhen you have a university with a thriving chemistry department you might get a paint manufacturer who says: \u2018This is a good place to locate a plant, because we can get consultants down the road very easily\u2019.\u201d Most federal science funds are distributed by government agencies on a competitive, peer-reviewed basis. Despite occasional carping that the peer-review system acts as an \u2018old-boys' network\u2019, most analysts consider it to be in pretty good shape. In general, good science is done by the best scientists, who are attracted to the best institutions in search of the best research environment. It's a fair system \u2014 but a self-perpetuating one. States such as Texas, Florida and Arizona, which have enjoyed massive growth in their populations and economies during recent years, are still struggling to make their mark in science.  The National Institutes of Health (NIH) has come to dominate the research scene since its budget doubled to $27 billion in the five years to 2003, and it now accounts for two-thirds of funding for academic research and development. But the agency's rise in funding has now flattened out. And some observers say that the boom, which benefited every academic research centre in the nation, has fostered delusions of grandeur in the \u2018have-not\u2019 states. \n               Big ideas \n             Joe Cortright, an analyst at Impresa, an economics consultancy based in Portland, Oregon, says that a study he did in 2002 for the Washington-based Brookings Institution showed a clear trend. Almost everywhere had twice as much biomedical funding in 2001 as in 1995, he says. \u201cWhat the governor hears is \u2018Our state doubled its funding.\u2019 This has led a lot of people to believe, naively, that their community is a big player,\u201d Cortright says. Yet the boom hasn't radically altered the distribution of funding. In general, the top 100 institutions get four-fifths of the money, and everyone else shares the rest. There is no sign that this will change as funding growth slows. Yet from coast to coast, Cortright notes, relatively obscure universities continue to spin off research parks left, right and centre, and local politicians are flush with money for scientific initiatives. Florida is the fourth most populous US state, and its economy and population are among the fastest-growing in the nation. But in 2000 \u2014 the year of the most recent census \u2014 it ranked 44th out of 50 in a league table of the number of research dollars that academic institutions attracted per head of population. The state's best-known research facility is probably NASA's Kennedy Space Center, home of the space shuttle and assembly point for the International Space Station. The University of Florida advertises its science programmes as \u201cmore than just Gatorade\u201d, referring to the electrolyte-laced sports drink \u2014 the Gainesville university's most famous invention that has generated $80 million in licensing income for the university. The Scripps initiative is Jeb Bush's attempt to transform the state's scientific reputation in one fell swoop. He hopes that science can become a pillar of the state's economy, providing better-paid jobs than the current big employers: tourism, military bases and citrus farming. Scripps would be the largest of a number of science projects, from a small, existing medical-device industry to a \u2018high-technology corridor\u2019 stretching across the centre of the state from the Gulf of Mexico to the Atlantic and anchored by the University of Central Florida in Orlando and the University of South Florida in Tampa. \n               Attractive prospect \n              The Scripps project isn't the first attempt to kick-start high technology in the \u2018sunshine state\u2019. In 1990, Florida unexpectedly beat Massachusetts to host most of a national magnet laboratory, a facility supported by the National Science Foundation. The National High Magnetic Field Laboratory (NHMFL) is now well-established, with one site tucked behind Florida State University at Tallahassee, another at the University of Florida in Gainesville, and a third at Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico. The NHMFL is a world leader in very powerful magnets. The Tallahassee site houses some of the world's largest resistive and hybrid magnets, which look like outsized water heaters and use about 10% of Tallahassee's entire power supply. The lab is used by some 1,000 researchers each year in various disciplines to investigate molecules and materials. Greg Boebinger, who joined the NHMFL as director last year, was as surprised as anyone when Florida won the laboratory from its previous site at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. \u201cI was among the people who said: \u2018What is this?\u2019,\u201d he admits, laughing. \u201cOne of the main reasons Florida got it was state support.\u201d The state put up about $80 million to get the contract.  Boebinger is a great believer in the economic value of basic research. The magnet lab is like most scientific investments, he says: it repays into the community \u201can order of magnitude\u201d more than it cost the state to build it. Federal funds for the NHMFL flow on into the local economy. An economic assessment conducted for the state last year by Florida State University's Center for Economic Forecasting and Analysis reported that Florida had got back three-and-a-half times its initial investment in the facility. The NHMFL has also been mentioned by Scripps officials as a possible collaborator. Pat Griffin, head of drug discovery for Scripps Florida, visited the facility in January to discuss this idea. Florida officials are betting that Scripps can replicate the magnet lab's success on a far grander scale. \n               Sunny outlook? \n             Last September, at a meeting of the economic development organization Enterprise Florida, several speakers argued that Scripps could act as the centrepiece of a coordinated plan for the development of the life sciences in Florida. Presentation after presentation forecast a rosy scientific future for the state. An analyst from Ernst & Young assured the audience, for example, that biotechnology in the United States was \u201cclearly on the road to profitability for the first time\u201d, and predicted it would be reach that goal in 2008. But some speakers were more cautious. Kenneth Kirby, now president of TransDermal Technologies, said he had encountered difficulties in starting up his drug-delivery company in Lake Park, Florida. He identified a funding gap for start-ups in the state, saying that venture capital there is relatively under-developed. Another speaker hit a nerve by joking that Florida universities, conditioned by years of competitive football, can't seem to collaborate very well. Indeed, several competing universities would like to be champions of Florida's scientific future, and their rivalry could hold the state back, suggests Irwin Feller, an economist and science-policy specialist at the American Association for the Advancement of Science in Washington. Florida, he says, \u201cfits the profile of a state where politics is in the way\u201d. Feller adds that local politicians tend to expect an unrealistically quick return on their investment. \u201cAll their interest is economic.\u201d Sena Black, a vice-president of Enterprise Florida, notes that science-based companies started by researchers from outside the state can depart as soon as they become large enough to hire an experienced chief executive. \u201cTo get them to stay in Florida, they have to be Florida-bred, but Floridians are not being educated in science,\u201d she complains, adding that school science and mathematics education is weak. But she remains optimistic. \u201cWe have these pockets of science. It's more than meets the eye.\u201d \n               Digging deep \n             Now the state seeks a larger pocket of excellence. In October 2003, Palm Beach County spent $60 million buying a large family farm for the Scripps site. What was once wetlands, and then rows of citrus trees, is now a muddy field surrounded by slash pines and palmettos. But lawsuits from environmentalists have put the choice of the site into some doubt, and Scripps may now consider at least one other site near Palm Beach for the complex. Cortright isn't convinced by the ambitious Scripps Florida project. \u201cI am extremely sceptical that it will produce any kind of biotech industry there. Just because they do research doesn't mean that companies will open up. The money they are spending on Scripps moves it from way, way, way below to just about where everyone else is,\u201d he says. Griffin, who moved to Palm Beach from New Jersey to work at Scripps, is cautious too. \u201cIt's definitely not a guaranteed success,\u201d he says, \u201cand I think the next few years will determine whether Scripps can do what it wants.\u201d In the meantime, he is enjoying living where he used to go on holiday. Greg Schuckman, director of government relations at the University of Central Florida, thinks that Florida should be able to exploit its reputation as a land of sun, beaches and easy living. He hopes that scientists can be lured from \u201cthe tundra of the midwest, the cost of living in California and the winters of the northeast\u201d. Yet attempting to boost a regional economy with science is a risky move, perhaps riskier than some realize. Many state initiatives, including Florida's, are focusing on biotechnology. In Cortright's judgement, the game in this sector is over and the winners are already in: San Francisco, Boston and San Diego, plus pockets around the NIH in Maryland and at Research Triangle Park in North Carolina. \u201cAnyone pursuing it now is throwing their money away,\u201d he thinks.  Feller is less dismissive. \u201cIf a region can pull together the faculty and provide the resources, the opportunities are there,\u201d he says. Larger states that are trying to punch their weight in science will only do so if local institutional rivalries within the states are kept at bay, he suggests. But history shows that it is possible for states with little scientific activity to work their way up into the system over decades. \u201cThe system isn't rigid,\u201d he says. \u201cIt's just very stable.\u201d Greenberg generally agrees. He also points out that projects funded by Congress without peer review \u2014 known as \u2018earmarks\u2019 \u2014 can give a leg-up to institutions in the have-not states. These are generally absent from the National Science Foundation and the NIH, he says, but even these agencies have programmes aimed specifically at states that attract little peer-reviewed funding. Still, any movement tends to be glacial in pace. \u201cThe country and its scientific enterprise are both very mature now,\u201d says Greenberg. \u201cThese are not the gold-rush days anymore.\u201d \n                     http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/433559a \n                   \n                     http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/432546a \n                   \n                     http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/426598a \n                   \n                     http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/431005b \n                   \n                     NatureJobs Spotlight & Regions page \n                   \n                     US Biotech hotspots (Nature Biotechnology) \n                   \n                     Enterprise Florida \n                   \n                     Scripps Florida \n                   \n                     Florida High Tech Corridor \n                   \n                     National High Magnetic Field Laboratory \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Peter Aldhous reports from southeast Asia, where scientists, doctors and regulators battle against organized crime.  Sam Veasna's loss is still keenly felt in Cambodia, five years after his untimely death. In a desperately poor country where most people are preoccupied with the daily struggle for survival, he was a tenacious field biologist and passionate advocate for conservation whose work made a real difference \u2014 until he fell prey to malaria. In November 1999, Veasna ventured to the remote north of the country in search of the elusive kouprey \u2014 a wild cow that is Cambodia's national animal, but which may already be extinct. True to form, the kouprey evaded Veasna. But the mosquitoes didn't. Back home in Siem Reap, where he ran the provincial government's wildlife office, Veasna fell ill. He was treated with tablets labelled as mefloquine, an antimalarial drug, which should have restored him to health. But his fever continued to rage. \u201cBy the time we realized what was going on, he was slipping into a coma,\u201d recalls Colin Poole, who heads the Asia programme of the Wildlife Conservation Society, based in New York. \u201cWe organized a medical evacuation to Bangkok.\u201d But it was too late. Veasna was pronounced dead on 3 December, shortly before the plane that was to whisk him to Thailand touched down in Siem Reap. He was just 33, and left behind a wife and three children. Veasna was almost certainly a victim of the trade in counterfeit drugs \u2014 bogus products that often contain no active ingredients, or the wrong ones. Cambodia can ill afford to see its brightest lights snuffed out in this way, having already lost a generation of intellectuals in the 1970s to the genocidal Khmer Rouge regime. Yet a criminal investigation into Veasna's death soon collapsed through lack of evidence \u2014 the offending tablets had been thrown away. If he hadn't been internationally renowned, things would probably never even have got that far. Many ordinary Cambodians are thought to suffer a similar fate each year, their deaths gaining scant media attention and prompting no official response. No one knows how many deaths in the developing world can be blamed on fake pharmaceuticals. But thanks to the diligence of researchers who are monitoring the effectiveness of malaria treatments, we now do know that the trade in counterfeit antimalarial drugs is rife across southeast Asia. Scientists are battling the menace of fake drugs by raising awareness among doctors and their patients, and running lab tests to screen for counterfeits. But there's only so much they can do. Next week in Paris, at the 2nd Global Forum on Pharmaceutical Anticounterfeiting, experts will try to plot the way forward. It's already clear that this will require more rigorous efforts to crack down on the ruthless criminals who profit from the trade in bogus drugs. \n               Innocent victims \n             The alarm about fake antimalarials began to sound just months before Veasna's death. In 1999, Jan Rozendaal, who then ran the European Union's Cambodia Malaria Control Project, began to hear reports of patients who failed to respond to treatment with artesunate. This drug, derived from a Chinese herb, is highly effective against forms of the malaria parasite that resist earlier generations of antimalarials \u2014 particularly when used in combination with mefloquine. So if the parasite was evolving resistance to artesunate, it would have been a major blow.  But the problem wasn't drug resistance. Those who failed to respond to artesunate had bought suspiciously cheap supplies from small commercial pharmacies. So Rozendaal collected his own samples from similar outlets, and sent them for analysis to the Thai Ministry of Public Health 1 . The drugs were sold in blister packs bearing the name of Guilin Pharma, a company in China's Guangxi province. But about half the packs contained dummy pills with no active ingredient. Close inspection revealed subtle differences in the packaging that distinguished them from the genuine Guilin product. It was a similar story for bottles of mefloquine tablets, purportedly manufactured in Australia. In this case, the fakes had carved out a dominant market share. Disturbed by his findings, Rozendaal contacted Nick White, a leading malaria researcher at the UK Wellcome Trust's unit at Mahidol University in Bangkok. The trust has units and collaborators across southeast Asia, so White was able to extend Rozendaal's investigation to cover the entire region. Over a year, ending in August 2000, volunteers purchased artesunate in Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand and Vietnam. Of a total of 104 samples bought more or less at random, 38% were found to be fakes containing no active ingredient 2 . The researchers hoped their survey would raise awareness of the problem, and they subsequently called for international action to clamp down on the counterfeiters 3 . But a follow-up study, which concluded in February 2003, revealed that the situation had actually worsened. This time, 53% of 188 artesunate samples were useless fakes 4 . Worse, the counterfeiters had upped their game, improving their mimicry of the Guilin packaging to the point that the fake packs were virtually indistinguishable (see  \u2018Hologram wars\u2019 ). Back in 2000, many pharmacists probably knew they were selling knock-offs, says Arjen Dondorp, a clinician at the Wellcome Trust's Bangkok unit, who coordinated the second survey. \u201cThey'd say: \u2018This is a little bit less effective, but it's cheaper.\u2019\u201d In Cambodia, where the average annual income is about US$300 and a course of artesunate sells for about US$1.50, that was an especially compelling sales pitch. Today, Dondorp suspects that some pharmacists are being duped as well, and the price difference between genuine and fake artesunate has all but disappeared. \u201cIt's clearly organized crime, and highly sophisticated,\u201d says Dondorp. Sophisticated, maybe, but callous in the extreme. \u201cYou can think of it as attempted murder,\u201d he adds. \n               Streetlife \n             In December, I visit the Cambodian capital, Phnom Penh, to get a feel for the environment in which this trade flourishes. There are many reminders that this is one of Asia's poorest countries: at one junction, people are picking through piles of garbage for anything that might be reused. I wander the streets, searching out the city's small pharmacies. Most consist of a single open-fronted room, separated from the street by a simple counter. Packages of drugs line the walls inside. At each, I turn up with a scrap of paper on which I've written \u201cartesunate or mefloquine\u201d or \u201ctetracycline\u201d. The last of these drugs is an antibiotic deployed against a variety of bacterial infections; it is also used, together with quinine, to treat malaria.  For someone used to the controlled environment of a typical Western pharmacy, this shopping trip is an eye-opening experience. Over two days, I visit a total of 27 outlets. Only once am I asked about the condition the drugs are supposed to treat. \u201cIt's for a friend with a fever,\u201d I say, before enquiring about the dose. The pharmacist says that my friend should take three tablets of tetracycline each day. But for how long? She scrutinizes the Khmer language information sheet supplied with the antibiotic, which doesn't seem to help. \u201cAs long as you like,\u201d she eventually suggests \u2014 vague advice that could place patients at risk, and promote the spread of drug resistance. \n               Faking it \n             As I pocket the packages, I contemplate the odds of them being genuine. Two official surveys conducted by the Cambodian Ministry of Health, with the backing of the World Health Organization, have shed some light on this question. National drug-testing labs in Phnom Penh and Bangkok looked at 230 samples of 24 pharmaceuticals purchased on the Cambodian market in 2000, including antibiotics and painkillers. They found about 3.5% of them contained less than 60% of the labelled quantity of active ingredient 5 . When the survey was repeated for a wider range of drugs purchased in 2003, 11% of the samples fell into this category 6 . Both surveys also turned up a small number of products that contained the wrong ingredient. Some of these problems may represent shoddy manufacturing, rather than conscious criminality. But ominously, the team that ran the second survey was unable to find any official record of the existence of five of the companies whose drugs they found on sale in Cambodia. \u2018Brainy Pharmaceutical\u2019, for instance, is supposedly based in Thailand, but is not registered with the appropriate authority in Bangkok. Its tested products included fake antibiotics with no active ingredients. Chroeng Sokhan, vice-director of the Cambodian health ministry's Department of Drugs and Food, is trying to prevent bogus manufacturers from operating quite so brazenly in his country. His department, based in a run-down building in a shabby side street of Phnom Penh, has held workshops to educate retailers, and distributed posters warning of the dangers posed by counterfeit drugs \u2014 including some with photographs of known fakes. \u201cThose products are harder to find on the market now,\u201d says Sokhan. In recent weeks, the anti-counterfeiting campaign has extended to broadcasting adverts on state-run television.  These activities have relied heavily on foreign aid, as do most efforts to combat drug counterfeiting in Cambodia. The US Pharmacopeia, a non-governmental body that develops standards to ensure drug quality, is working in the country with funding from the US Agency for International Development. Focusing on malaria drugs, it has already turned up samples of Brainy-branded quinine that \u2014 like the bogus company's antibiotics \u2014 don't contain any of the correct active ingredient. Part of the strategy has been to involve provincial officials in testing drug samples, so that they take ownership of the problem. \u201cThey were very surprised when they found fake drugs in their provinces,\u201d says Lon Chantap, a researcher at the National Center for Parasitology, Entomology and Malaria Control in Phnom Penh, who works on the project. Testing the quality of drugs is usually the preserve of large, well-funded national laboratories. But the US Pharmacopeia's project is also using a \u2018minilab\u2019 developed by the German Pharma Health Fund, a charity financed by that country's drug industry. This portable kit allows local technicians to analyse pharmaceutical ingredients using simplified versions of techniques such as chromatography 7 . At the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, Georgia, analytical chemist Michael Green is similarly working on cheap drug-testing methods, including a red dye that turns yellow in the presence of artesunate 8 . But in Cambodia, problems thrown up by grinding poverty run deeper than the ability to afford good drug-quality tests. Qualified staff are few in number and poorly paid. Sokhan can call upon just 13 national inspectors to police the country's entire drug supply. As the sun sets, he takes me for a drive through the streets that surround Phnom Penh's Olympic Market, which are packed with small pharmacies and wholesalers that sell drugs on to retailers in the provinces. Many, says Sokhan, are unlicensed outlets, and their continued existence is obviously a major source of frustration for him. \u201cUnbelievable,\u201d Sokhan mutters, as we turn back towards the main road.  The next morning I continue my shopping trip. My final haul consists of five blister packs of Guilin-branded artesunate, some loose capsules of mefloquine, and five samples of tetracycline. In addition, I have three packets of a product called Malarine, which includes both artesunate and mefloquine pills and is distributed by Population Services International. This nonprofit body in Washington DC tackles problems with health and family planning in the developing world by placing affordable products into the commercial sector. At least these should be OK, I muse, before sending the samples to Green for testing. \n               Clean sweep \n             All of my drugs turn out to contain roughly the right quantities of active ingredients, and so seem to be genuine. Given that some of the pharmacies I visited carried Sokhan's posters, perhaps the campaign is having some effect. But Sokhan and other experts warn against reading too much into these results. As a wealthy Westerner, my sources suggest, I am more likely to be sold genuine drugs than a typical Cambodian customer. Perhaps if Veasna had been one of the many tourists who flock to Siem Reap to visit the ancient temples of Angkor, he would still be alive today.  For anyone familiar with Western practices of drug regulation, the solutions to Cambodia's problems with fake drugs seem clear: get police and customs officials to crack down on the distribution chain, allow only licensed pharmacists to continue operating, and close any pharmacy caught selling counterfeit products. But Sokhan says that his department doesn't have the power to enforce such measures. \u201cWe can do things only step by step,\u201d he says. \u201cIt's not easy.\u201d Sokhan won't be pressed into further explanation, but Rozendaal is frank about the obstacles to progress. Corruption is endemic in Cambodia, he says, and the distributors of counterfeit drugs are protected by powerful figures in the government. Now working as a consultant in Indonesia, Rozendaal is free to speak out. But when he raised the alarm about fake drugs in Cambodia while running the European Union's malaria project, Rozendaal felt his job was threatened as spurious complaints about his competency reached his bosses in Brussels. For local officials, the stakes could be even higher. \u201cYou really take a big personal risk,\u201d says Rozendaal. In some neighbouring countries, law enforcement is more rigorous. In Laos, for example, some pharmacies have been closed down. And as an example of what's possible, experts point to Nigeria, where one influential woman has made a courageous and effective stand against pharmaceutical counterfeiting (see \u2018In the line of fire\u2019,  page 134 ). But counterfeit drugs will continue to plague southeast Asia until the problem is defeated at its source. That means targeting the factories that are producing the fakes, which are mostly thought to be in China. This, in turn, will require pharmaceutical firms and governments to exert pressure on the Chinese authorities. Some progress is being made, says Joe Damond, deputy vice-president for international affairs with PhRMA, the trade body that represents the US drug industry. Regulations designed to combat drug counterfeiting have recently been strengthened, he says. The acid test will be how these are implemented. So far, Chinese drug counterfeiters have mostly been handed modest fines that they can write off as a cost of doing business. As a result, some organized criminals are believed to have shifted their activities from narcotics, where sentences are severe and include the death penalty, to fake pharmaceuticals. Those who mourn Veasna's death can confirm that this new trade is equally murderous. And they are still waiting for his killers to be brought to justice. \n                     http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/nrd1595 \n                   \n                     http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/nm0204-111a \n                   \n                     http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/90183 \n                   \n                     http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/434134a \n                   \n                     2nd Global Forum on Pharmaceutical Anticounterfeiting \n                   \n                     WHO Project on Counterfeit and Substandard Medicines \n                   \n                     US Pharmacopeia Drug Quality and Information Program \n                   \n                     German Pharma Health Fund Minilab \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},
{"file_id": "434694a", "url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/434694a", "year": 2005, "authors": [{"name": "Peter Aldhous"}], "parsed_as_year": "2006_or_before", "body": "California's voters have authorized the spending of $3 billion over the next decade on stem-cell research. But will this bonanza bring threats as well as opportunities? Peter Aldhous weighs the hopes and fears. Bob Klein is a man in a hurry. This energetic 59-year-old entrepreneur rose to public prominence last year, spearheading the campaign that convinced California's voters to back an audacious plan to create a $3-billion public fund to advance research on human stem cells. Interviewed by  Nature  in late February, he was determined to press ahead as soon as possible: \u201cMy goal would be to approve the first grants in May.\u201d But today Klein and his supporters are wrestling with the practical realities of building their multibillion-dollar research agency, called the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine (CIRM), from scratch, while fending off political and legal attacks from both long-standing opponents and former allies. It's already clear that Klein's May deadline will be missed by several months. Stem-cell biologists are looking forward to the injection of funds, whenever it finally arrives. But some question whether the CIRM can spend the huge sums at its disposal without wasting money on second-rate research. Some also fear a public backlash against stem-cell research, as claims about \u2018cures\u2019 made during the ballot campaign may have left people with unrealistic expectations. Others worry that the initiative has set a dangerous precedent by moving the centre of gravity of an important area of biomedical research away from the federal government, and subjecting it to the shifting winds of state electoral politics. Indeed, with several other states following California's lead and providing budgets for stem-cell research (see map, below), an unprecedented shift in the balance of power is under way. And biologists are divided on its likely consequences. The CIRM's legal and political difficulties centre on its governance, which is unusual for a state agency. The stem-cell ballot initiative, known as Proposition 71, placed the agency under the control of a 29-person citizens' committee with little input from California's legislature. The committee, chaired by Klein, includes representatives of the biotech industry and academic institutions likely to receive CIRM funding. \n               Under attack \n             Lawsuits have been filed denouncing the CIRM as unconstitutional. These have been denied a hearing in the California Supreme Court, but the battle will resume in lower courts, and could yet interfere with the institute's plans to begin distributing money. Meanwhile, state senators Deborah Ortiz, a Democrat, and George Runner, a Republican, have said that they will press for a new ballot initiative to \u201creform\u201d the stem-cell programme. Ortiz backed Proposition 71, but has since criticized the initiative's procedures for accountability and avoiding conflicts of interest. Assuaging these concerns will test Klein's powers of persuasion. But there's no doubting his personal commitment to the cause. Having made his fortune providing quality low-cost housing in the state, Klein ploughed $3 million of his own money into the Proposition 71 campaign. And he makes no secret of his hope that stem-cell research will help his 14-year-old son, who has juvenile diabetes. Klein recalls a 2002 conversation with his son: \u201cHe said, \u2018Dad, don't worry about me. Everyone is dying. I'm just dying a little faster.\u2019 For a father, that's not something you can live with.\u201d Klein's heart-on-sleeve demeanour and boundless energy were just what was needed in winning support for Proposition 71. But setting up a new research agency demands the skills of a consummate scientist\u2013administrator, which he is not. Headhunters are still drawing up a shortlist of candidates for the key position of president of the CIRM. In the interim, the post has been taken by Zach Hall, whose previous roles include directing the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke in Bethesda, Maryland. Hall has already begun to temper Klein's enthusiasm with a dose of caution, noting that the practical challenges of setting up a review process rule out the initial goal of approving some grants in May. \u201cWe still don't have our working groups appointed,\u201d says Hall. \u201cIn the fall we might be able to approve our first grants.\u201d The CIRM's main goal is to support research that either can't be backed by the federal government, or is unlikely to receive \u201ctimely or sufficient\u201d funding. Although the US Congress has recently considered the question of loosening federal rules 1 , the regulations currently limit federal dollars to work on the 78 human embryonic stem-cell lines created before August 2001. Many of the lines that seem most promising for research were isolated after this date. Researchers also say they need new cell lines that haven't been grown on a layer of mouse cells, as this causes biochemical contamination that will rule out their eventual use in human therapies 2 . So the CIRM's top priorities will include the creation of new embryonic stem-cell lines, mostly from embryos left over from  in vitro  fertilization procedures, but also from embryos created by cloning. In addition to investigating the feasibility of \u2018therapeutic cloning\u2019, in which a patient's own cells might be used to derive grafts to replace damaged tissues, cloning can be used to create embryonic cell lines from patients with genetic diseases \u2014 which could prove invaluable for understanding these conditions and testing potential treatments 3 , 4 . Biologists also want to investigate the basics, such as how stem cells arise in the developing embryo, and which signals coax them into developing into different tissue types. \u201cI think everybody agrees that more fundamental work needs to be done,\u201d says Evan Snyder, a stem-cell biologist at the Burnham Institute in La Jolla. \u201cThis is an initiative to move the field forward in an unencumbered way.\u201d Researchers will have to be careful to ensure that work involving non-approved cell lines is strictly separated from projects involving federal grants. In the long run, the CIRM may provide funding to build new labs to help this separation. But Klein wants to avoid delay, by leasing space lying empty in the San Francisco Bay Area and other cities. \u201cThere are lots of opportunities,\u201d he says. Maybe so, but experts in the field point out that relatively few researchers currently have expertise in working with human embryonic stem cells. And this, some biologists argue, makes it unwise to pour hundreds of millions of dollars into this area any time soon. \u201cA lot of money could be wasted on what is not the best work,\u201d warns Sean Morrison, a stem-cell biologist at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. Institute officials say that maintaining quality will be their priority, adding that their efforts won't be entirely focused on embryonic stem cells. The CIRM will support work on adult stem cells, and fund research into other questions that must be addressed to bring stem-cell therapies to the clinic. The agency might also choose to back specific therapeutic strategies that have been neglected by the federal National Institutes of Health (NIH), Klein argues. \n               Firm foundations \n             Klein adds that researchers have difficulty winning grants from the NIH in a young field such as stem-cell research, as it's difficult for them to gather enough preliminary data to make a case for serious study. \u201cSome of the brightest minds cannot get access to funding,\u201d says Klein. So part of the CIRM's strategy will be to provide \u2018seed\u2019 money to allow researchers new to the field to gather sufficient results for a convincing full grant application. And the agency's first awards are expected to be for academic institutions across California to hire graduate students and postdocs. \u201cWhat we're calling for here is a vast expansion of the intellectual and scientific workforce,\u201d says Hall. Biologists welcome this emphasis on bringing young researchers into the field. But some are anxious about the CIRM's wider effects on the US funding landscape. With other states pitching in, the momentum in stem-cell research is shifting away from the federal government \u2014 and opinion is divided on whether that's a good or a bad thing. \u201cThis represents a paradigm shift in how biomedical research gets funded in this country,\u201d says Snyder. \u201cIt could turn out to be a really wonderful opportunity.\u201d But other biologists see potential threats. For one thing, state activity is likely to provoke opponents of embryonic stem-cell research in the federal government into further action. \u2018Pro-life\u2019 conservatives in the US Congress will almost certainly resume legislative attempts to ban all human cloning procedures, whether for reproduction or research. But the deeper concern is that the Bush administration and its congressional allies will let the states take the lead, and scale back funding for the NIH. The agency's budget is already under pressure, given Bush's programme of tax cuts and the cost of the Iraq war, and the biomedical research community knows that it can't expect many favours. \u201cI am worried that the willingness of states to take up the slack is going to absolve the federal government of its responsibilities in this area,\u201d says George Daley, a stem-cell researcher at Harvard Medical School in Boston. Many biologists are concerned about the implications of the NIH having a reduced role in stem-cell research. They respect the federal agency's procedures for backing scientific excellence and adhering to rigorous ethical standards. And although Hall says that the CIRM plans to import many NIH procedures, the institute and the other state funding mechanisms are still unknown entities. \u201cThe less the NIH is involved in something, the less assurance we have that good ethical guidelines are followed,\u201d observes Jon Retzlaff, director of legislative relations with the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology. \n               Hope or hype? \n             Another worry about putting stem-cell research in state hands is that it may be more vulnerable to the ebb and flow of public opinion. And this, some researchers fear, may be set for a backlash. The use of the slogans \u201ccures for California\u201d and \u201csave lives with stem cells\u201d during the Proposition 71 campaign may have set public expectations too high, they say. Disappointment could result if treatments fail to emerge rapidly, or if patients suffer adverse events in clinical trials \u2014 as has happened in the field of gene therapy 5 . \u201cI think there was a concern about promising too much, even before Proposition 71,\u201d says Gordon Keller, a stem-cell biologist at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York. \u201cMy fear is that there are people who will try to move forward quicker than they should, and that could backfire very badly.\u201d The media are already alert to this possibility. A 23 February article in  The New York Times , for instance, questioned whether a planned clinical trial to use human embryonic stem cells to treat spinal injury is going \u201ctoo far, too soon into uncharted territory\u201d. The trial, which could begin next year, is based on the work of Hans Keirstead of the University of California, Irvine, who has shown that embryonic stem cells can be made to differentiate into cells that help to maintain and protect neurons 6 . Keirstead took a prominent role in the Proposition 71 campaign, discussing unpublished experiments in which spinal-injured rats were made to walk again. \u201cIt has never been my intention to contribute to the hype,\u201d says Keirstead, who stresses that he doesn't expect to see similarly dramatic results in human patients. But such subtleties were lost in the frenzy of the campaign. Some Californian stem-cell researchers say that they are now planning outreach activities to help manage public expectations. Indeed, some researchers who are gearing up to receive CIRM funding feel a heavy burden of responsibility. \u201cA lot of people do feel accountable here in California,\u201d says Fred Gage, a stem-cell researcher at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in La Jolla. \u201cWe want to make sure that it's done right, because we're under the microscope.\u201d \n                     http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/434427a \n                   \n                     http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/432660a \n                   \n                     http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/432131b \n                   \n                     http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/432135a \n                   \n                     http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/431723a \n                   \n                     Stem cell in focus \n                   \n                     California Institute for Regenerative Medicine \n                   \n                     Text of Proposition 71 \n                   \n                     NIH stem cell information \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},
{"file_id": "433566a", "url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/433566a", "year": 2005, "authors": [{"name": "Amanda Haag"}], "parsed_as_year": "2006_or_before", "body": "The fatty bones of dead whales provide rich pickings for creatures on the sea floor. Amanda Haag meets the scientists who go to extreme and unpleasant lengths to study the unique ecosystems on these corpses.  In 1987, a manned submersible called  Alvin  was making a routine dive along the muddy plains of the deep sea when its pilot spotted what he thought was the fossilized remains of a dinosaur. Instead of an exotic underwater beast, it turned out to be the 21-metre-long skeleton of a blue whale. But atop this mass of bones the pilot did find something exotic: a carpet of creatures, including bacteria and worms, similar to those found on the flanks of underwater volcanoes. The  Alvin  team had happened upon what have since become known as \u2018whale falls\u2019 \u2014 communities of creatures that thrive among the sulphur-laden ooze of decaying whales. Just as windfalls deliver a sudden bounty of ripened fruit, whale falls see the death of a whale bring a host of nutrients to the sea floor. The falls are few and far between, and difficult to track and study, but researchers are learning ever more \u2014 sometimes through extreme measures \u2014 about the new species to be found among the remains. Some 39 of the species discovered so far are thought to be especially suited or even unique to this environment. In the barren depths of the open ocean, a fallen whale carcass is a veritable feast. Scavengers such as sleeper sharks, hagfish and squat lobsters can dine for months to many years on the soft tissue of a single whale, depending on its size. As bits of whale tissue spread around the carcass, the enriched seafloor sediment provides nutrition for opportunistic worms and crustaceans. As anaerobic bacteria further the whale's decomposition, they create a sulphide-rich environment allowing sulphur-loving creatures to move in. Worms, clams and mussels, to name but a few, all take up residence, each getting their metabolic fix from the chemical energy provided by the fat-rich marrow in whale bones 1 . Such complex communities have not been reported on the bones of other marine mammals, says Craig Smith, a whale-fall expert from the University of Hawaii at Manoa. This is probably because whale bones are so much larger and fat-rich, he says. Scientists now estimate that a whale-fall community can survive for up to a century by sucking the fats and sulphides from these bones. The bacteria that make their home on whale falls are so good at degrading fat in cold waters that the biotechnology company Diversa in San Diego, California, is looking to see whether their enzymes might prove useful in cold-water detergents.  For scientists such as Smith, studying whale falls presents some inherent challenges \u2014 not least of which is finding a body to examine. Many whales die when female whales or newborns, stressed by the process of birth, make their annual migration. In the Pacific, for example, there are often casualties on the long treck north to Alaska from birthing grounds along the Baja Peninsula of Mexico. Although whale carcasses tend to accumulate along these migratory paths, they fall at random locations and can be spaced very far apart. \n               Body hunt \n             \u201cThey're hard to find because you can't just follow a particular geological feature on the sea floor and drive up to them like you can with hydrothermal vents,\u201d says Smith. In the early 1990s, the US Navy surveyed more than 300 square kilometres of the Pacific sea floor in search of a lost missile and found eight whale skeletons. The navy contacted Smith, but didn't take exact coordinates of where the skeletons were located. When Smith's team returned to the site, it could find only one of the eight. So far, ten natural whale falls have been investigated by the dozen or so scientists who study them. And another 20 have been sampled accidentally by trawling fishermen. In an attempt to increase these numbers, whale-fall researchers have resorted to sinking beached dead whales. But sinking a four-tonne juvenile grey whale, or a 35-tonne adult, is a major undertaking, says Smith. When researchers get a call about a washed-up whale, they mobilize their teams and ships. By the time they reach the whale it is often bloated with gases from decomposition. To get it to sink, the scientists have to weigh it down with up to 3,000 kilograms of scrap metal, from train wheels to anchor chains. It can take two days to get a whale from the shore to the sea floor \u2014 and all those involved agree that it is a highly unpleasant process. \u201cWe often throw away our clothes because you can't get the smell out,\u201d says Smith. \u201cIt's one of the hazards of the job.\u201d  Researchers have so far sunk about 20 whales this way. They return to these whale falls regularly to monitor the colonization of organisms on the remains. Smith's group placed a time-lapse camera on one carcass, which took pictures more-or-less continuously for eight months. Others send submersibles to the sites, which can pick up rib bones and vertebrae and bring them to the surface with the communities still alive and mostly intact. Thomas Dahlgren, a population geneticist at the Tj\u00e4rn\u00f6 Marine Biological Laboratory in Str\u00f6mstad, Sweden, has been fortunate enough to sink a whale near his lab. The whale falls that have been studied off the coast of California tend to be 1,200\u20133,000 metres deep and at least half-a-day's cruise away from the nearest lab; Dahlgren's whale is 125 metres deep and just half an hour from his office. \u201cWe're not stuck on a ship in the Pacific bobbing around with a limited time until the cruise is over,\u201d says Dahlgren. He and his team can sample the whale fall as often as once a week. Dahlgren's lab also keeps whale bones with live specimens in a seawater tank. Unlike creatures found at hydrothermal vents, which can only survive at the high pressures found at the bottom of the deep sea, some whale-fall organisms seem to adapt quite well to life on the surface. \u201cWhale bones are hanging in our cold room with cultures of these whale bacteria stuck all over them,\u201d says Dahlgren. \n               Crunch time \n             Such research has unveiled a number of strange creatures. Perhaps the prize find so far is a newly described worm genus,  Osedax 2  \u2014 Latin for \u2018bone-devourer\u2019 \u2014 which has a clever metabolic strategy. With no mouth, stomach or eyes,  Osedax  has evolved a root system to excavate the fat out of whale bones. The worms tunnel into the bones with their green, fleshy roots and turn them into \u201cSwiss cheese\u201d, says Smith. The worms then rely on bacteria within their tissues to digest fats and oils from the bone marrow. Although the bacteria are similar to those found in oil slicks, this sort of microbe has never been found in a symbiotic partnership with another creature before.  So far, researchers have found five species of  Osedax  \u2014 four in the Pacific and, most recently, one in the Atlantic, implying that the worms have a worldwide distribution. Two of the species have a matriarchal society of sorts, in which all of the female members are about the length of an index finger, and the males are mere microscopic threads that live inside the females' oviducts. A single female can hold up to 111 males. Another oddity is a whale-fall worm nicknamed \u2018Pinky\u2019, which at first evaded identification by its researchers, including Greg Rouse at the University of Adelaide in Australia. After much head-scratching, it became apparent that Pinky was just a polychaete worm \u2014 the class that includes ragworms and lugworms \u2014 albeit much larger than its shallow-water relatives. \u201cPinky is a giant,\u201d says Rouse. \u201cHe's more than one centimetre long, whereas his relatives are of the order of a couple of millimetres. Pinky's also quite fat.\u201d The worm measures a whopping one to two millimetres across. Many mysteries about the whale-fall communities remain. For one thing, scientists are trying to find out how larvae from whale-fall organisms that are spawned into the water live long enough to find their way to another bone. \u201cIt is really clever. We don't know how they do it, but they do it,\u201d says Paul Tyler, a deep-sea ecologist at the Southampton Oceanography Centre, UK. Scientists guess that the creatures in whale-fall communities probably date back some 35 million years. But in the past few centuries they have faced a serious threat. Smith estimates that whaling in the 1800s and 1900s reduced whale-fall habitat by up to 95%, potentially wiping out up to half of the species that were specialized to live on whale carcasses in some ocean basins 3 . Each time a whale was dragged aboard a ship, it not only depleted the live stocks, but also those of the dead falling to the sea floor. It's not just the whales that needed saving, notes Smith. If hunting had continued apace it might have wiped out not only the great whales, but Pinky too. \n                     NOAA: this whale's (after) life \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Can this novel herbal cocktail ease withdrawal and reduce drug cravings? Peter Aldhous investigates. Tung doesn't ask for much in life: he dreams of finding a job, getting married, and becoming, as he puts it, a \u201cnormal person\u201d. But the dark stains on his arms mark him out as a social pariah. Tung was once so desperate for his regular fix of opium that he would first smoke the drug, and then mix the residue with water to create an injectable paste that has discoloured his veins. Now 28, this is Tung's second time in rehab. In the West, doctors might try to wean Tung off drugs by putting him on a substitute opiate such as methadone, and then gradually reducing the dose. But this is Vietnam, where the authorities take a tough line on what they view as a social evil. At the state-run drug-treatment clinic in Hoa Binh, some two hours' drive into the hills west of Hanoi, abrupt detoxification is the order of the day. Recovering addicts must first go \u2018cold turkey\u2019 in concrete cells furnished with only a mattress. Many, including Tung, have been forcibly detained. The conditions may be harsh, but the Hoa Binh clinic is at the centre of an experiment in drug rehabilitation that has sparked the curiosity of clinicians worldwide. Here, hundreds of addicts have been treated with a cocktail of herbal extracts called Heantos. It is claimed that it makes withdrawal tolerable and, in the longer term, reduces the craving for drugs. From its crude beginnings as a thick brown syrup, Heantos has been refined into a series of subtly different formulations, given at different stages of detoxification and recovery. They are produced in a pilot plant at the Vietnamese Academy of Science and Technology's Institute of Chemistry in Hanoi. And within a year, a clinical trial in Germany may reveal whether the hopes that the institute has invested in Heantos are justified. In many countries, Heantos would have remained on the medical fringes. But in Vietnam, there is little of the tension that, in the West, divides the practice of herbalism from the high-tech world of pharmaceutical chemistry. So in the mid-1990s, when Tran Van Sung, now director of the Institute of Chemistry, was approached by a herbalist touting a concoction that could allegedly reform hardened drug addicts, his first instinct wasn't to dismiss the healer as a quack. \n               Refined approach \n             Instead, Sung engaged with the herbalist, Tran Khuong Dan, as a collaborator. \u201cWe had difficulties understanding one another in the beginning,\u201d Sung admits. Dan's focus on the overall blend of plant extracts in his creation initially jarred with Sung's desire to standardize and improve techniques for extracting the main compounds present. But slowly, their goals coalesced. Dan is today an associate of the chemistry institute, and is named as co-inventor, with Sung and his colleagues, on a German patent application. The Heantos story began more than a decade before Dan's initial contact with Sung, when Dan was practising in Ho Chi Minh City. After seeing his brother and father fall foul of drugs, Dan travelled the country, investigating remedies used to treat addicts. Individually, none worked very well. But by the end of the decade, Dan had come up with a cocktail of herbal extracts that \u2014 judging from tests he conducted on himself, after deliberately getting hooked on various opiates \u2014 provided relief from drug withdrawal. \u201cIt was dangerous, but there was no other choice,\u201d says Dan. Whether this tale has been embellished is hard to say. But flashy showmanship doesn't seem to be Dan's style. On our trip to Hoa Binh, he is quiet and detached; facts about his work on Heantos have to be coaxed from him through an interpreter. Perhaps Dan has grown tired of telling the story, given the tortuous road that Heantos has travelled. The treatment first came to international attention in 1997, when the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) decided to invest US$400,000 in its scientific development. Since then, a similar sum has come from the Norwegian government, with additional support from the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization. By local standards, this is lavish funding. And it has caused some tensions within Vietnam, where there are competing approaches to drug detoxification. \u201cHeantos has certainly been contentious,\u201d says Ayo Wahlberg, a graduate student at the London School of Economics who is interested in the regulation of herbal medicines, and has made several trips to Vietnam. In the late 1990s, for instance, rumours circulated that some patients had died following adverse reactions. But subsequent safety evaluations by the Vietnamese authorities have given Heantos a clean bill of health. In parallel, Sung and his colleagues have refined the techniques used to produce Heantos, replacing Dan's method of grinding the plants in water with solvent extraction and freeze-drying. They have also begun characterizing the chemical constituents of the resulting formulations. \u201cWe have several hundred pure compounds,\u201d says Sung. But their identity, and that of the 13 plants from which Heantos is derived, is being kept under wraps until the German patent application is published. Shortly after the UNDP got involved, there was a flurry of publicity when a group of foreign journalists interviewed Dan and met addicts who had been treated with Heantos. Some of the resulting articles painted Heantos as a miracle cure, citing positive results from Vietnamese trials \u2014 including a study of 110 veterans of what is known here as the American War, who had become addicted to the morphine used to ease the pain of their wounds. \n               Outside influence \n             But the Vietnamese clinical studies of Heantos have all failed to meet the gold standard of double blind, placebo-controlled trials. Clinical research is weak in Vietnam. So if the effectiveness of Heantos was to be assessed to internationally recognized standards, it seemed that this would require a trial outside Vietnam. Initially, this was going to be carried out by a team led by Donald Jasinski at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine in Baltimore, Maryland. But the planned trial's US proponents failed to secure funding. Eventually, the government of the state of North Rhine Westphalia in Germany, where attitudes to herbal medicine are more positive than in many other Western countries, came to the rescue. In 2001, it agreed to fund a trial to test the ability of Heantos to ease withdrawal symptoms. The protocol, designed by psychiatrist Norbert Scherbaum of the University Hospital in Essen, calls for the treatment to be given to 30 heroin addicts, while another 30 are given a placebo. But before the trial could go ahead, the German authorities demanded analysis of the Heantos formulations by the Institute of Plant Biochemistry in Halle. Given that Heantos is such a complex mixture, satisfying the demands of regulatory authorities has been a persistent problem, says Wahlberg. Even a 2004 European Union (EU) directive, designed to lower the hurdles for certain herbal remedies, doesn't provide much assistance. It offers a simplified registration procedure, with few requirements for lengthy preclinical tests and clinical trials, for products that have \u201ca well-established medicinal use\u201d within the EU. Heantos is the product of Dan's invention and Sung's chemical expertise, so it doesn't qualify. Scherbaum hopes to begin enrolling patients in the trial within the next few months, and to have results by the end of this year. Experts who have followed the progress of Heantos are taking a cautious view. \u201cI've seen a lot of \u2018magic bullets\u2019 come and go,\u201d says Gabrielle Welle-Strand of the Centre for Medication-Assisted Rehabilitation in Oslo, Norway, who was a member of an international team of addiction specialists that visited Vietnam in 1999 to witness the treatment's use. Scherbaum's trial also isn't designed to test the claims that Heantos can reduce the underlying craving for drugs that prevents many reformed addicts from keeping clean in the long term. Here, there is no such thing as a miracle cure \u2014 as Tung can testify. After his first spell in rehab, aided by Heantos, he returned to his hometown of Mai Chau, in the mountains near the border with Laos. Unable to find work, Tung soon fell in with his old drug-taking friends, and was enslaved to opium once more. But if Heantos is shown by Scherbaum's trial to have some therapeutic value, it would provide a boost to the prospect of a treatment that seems for the past few years to have become stuck in limbo. Even the Vietnamese authorities have yet to decide whether to approve Heantos for general use. There's certainly a growing demand in this part of the world for treatments to aid drug rehabilitation. A few years back, Vietnamese drug addicts were few in number, and mostly rural users of opium. Today, there's a burgeoning heroin problem, both in the rapidly expanding cities and along the roads from Laos, used to transport the drug for illegal export. This trade blights the region, and the wider world. Will Dan and Sung's efforts one day allow Vietnam to be known for exporting an antidote to addiction, rather than merely being a trade route for the criminals who feed it? The answer may lie in Essen. \n                     http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/430394a \n                   \n                     http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/419872a \n                   \n                     http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/news000511-8 \n                   \n                     Vietnamese Academy of Science and Technology \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Now one researcher is using an ultra-high-speed camera to watch this dance in unprecedented detail \u2014 but that hasn't stopped the arguments. Alison Abbott investigates. When Akihiro Kusumi ran his grainy black-and-white film of a single molecule dancing maniacally against a grey background, a wave of confusion passed through the audience. Those seeing the pictures for the first time gaped in amazement and scepticism. Questions were fired from the floor. What exactly is being measured? How did you do it? Can you really catch the rapid movements of such a molecule on film? At this conference in Italy last autumn, Kusumi was claiming to show the movement of a protein within the lipid membrane of a living mammalian cell, on microsecond and nanometre scales. In decades of membrane research, no one else has come close to such a precise level of visualization. Kusumi's analyses have led him to propose a sweeping hypothesis for cell membrane dynamics, which he calls \u2018hop diffusion\u2019. He suggests that molecules move around in the membrane at breakneck speed, but are confined in small areas by \u2018fences\u2019 created by the cell's actin cytoskeleton \u2014 a mesh of filaments that helps give a cell its shape. Occasionally the molecules hop over these fences, and so seem to travel over larger distances at a relatively sedate rate (see  \u2018Fenced in\u2019 ). This rather simple idea may not sound like a bombshell, but it is causing a sensation in the world of membrane biophysics. If true, the concept would solve some long-standing puzzles about how proteins move within a membrane. Perhaps more important, it would also shed light on how signals from the outside world are transmitted through the membrane to the inside of the cell \u2014 a process that is central to cell behaviour in health and disease. Working out the details of signal transduction is one of today's major challenges. Cell and molecular biologists have spent years identifying which proteins in a cell membrane need to bind together to convey a signal, but they have not been able to explain how these proteins manage to meet and interact so successfully. Kusumi's work has been controversial among the  cognoscenti  for some years, and in the past he has had problems getting published. This was partly a consequence of his interdisciplinary approach, which brought into the field new technologies that no one else was able to acquire \u2014 most pertinently ultrafast filming technology borrowed from the field of explosion research. In the past few years his work has gained greater acceptance, although there are still those who argue with his bold interpretations of his data. \n               Movie maker \n             Kusumi, who has recently moved to the University of Kyoto, is relentlessly cheerful, and seems to take attacks on the chin, ploughing happily on and finding humour in every situation. Like the molecules he studies, he does not like to be too confined. And he certainly does not want to be placed in a tight scientific box. \u201cI studied both physics and biology as an undergraduate and did my PhD in biophysics,\u201d he says. \u201cPeople like to think that I spend most of my time working with machines, but in fact I spend most of my time thinking about biology.\u201d Such credentials, he indicates, have helped him to bridge the parallel worlds of biophysics and cell biology. He began his independent research career in the early 1980s. Then, the working hypothesis for membrane dynamics was the 1972 \u2018fluid mosaic model\u2019, which described membranes as a double layer of lipids that holds protein molecules (see picture, right). Some of the proteins pass from outside the cell right the way through the \u2018lipid bilayer\u2019 into the cell's inside; others sit in just the outer lipid layer poking their heads outside the cell membrane. Yet others nuzzle onto or into the inner layer of lipids from within the cell. The membrane proteins are not fixed but, according to this theory, can diffuse freely around in their lipid environment through brownian motion \u2014 the random movement of atoms and molecules due to thermal energy. This structural picture, which is still believed to be broadly true, is supported by biochemical and microscopic evidence 1 . But there are serious problems with the idea that brownian motion alone is responsible for the movement in a cell membrane. In the 1980s, it became clear to biophysicists that proteins in living cells moved within the membrane up to 100 times slower than they did in artificial membranes \u2014 simple lipid constructions made in the lab. Something, they reasoned, must be constraining the free diffusion of proteins in natural, living membranes. \n               Hidden depths \n             Cell biologists, meanwhile, had a problem with the very concept of proteins moving by free diffusion \u2014 it didn't square with new information about the function of membrane proteins. Many membrane proteins are involved in the complex business of cellular signalling. A common signal is the binding of a hormone or a growth factor to the part of a membrane-spanning receptor protein sticking outside of a cell. The binding causes the receptor to change shape, sparking a sequence of interactions with other proteins in the lipids that allows the message to be carried to the appropriate machinery inside the cell. Cell and molecular biologists identified a large number of such proteins in different signalling pathways, and by the 1990s they were no longer convinced that free diffusion was sufficient to explain how the right line-up of proteins arrived in the right place at the right time to guarantee interaction. It was becoming clear that a higher order of organization in the membrane was called for to constrain the signalling molecules. Enter the \u2018lipid raft hypothesis\u2019, which proposed that protein movement could be constrained by the physicochemical properties of different mixtures of lipids. According to this idea, the various lipids in a cell membrane are not randomly distributed, as previously supposed, but can group into clusters that are more viscous than the rest of the membrane 2 . These floating rafts of specific types of lipid provide favourable environments for certain proteins, and so effectively confine them to a limited area. The coming together of several small rafts during signalling initiation would then get all the right proteins into the same place at the same time. The raft hypothesis was a godsend for those developing ideas about the dynamics of cell signalling. But there are sceptics. Although rafts have apparently been seen under the microscope, most evidence for their existence is indirect, and some believe that they are an artefact of the way the cells are prepared for analysis. Someone has even coined the term \u2018unidentified floating objects\u2019 for them. \n               Cells on film \n             But if rafts are not the answer, what else could confine protein molecules to a small space for long enough to allow the appropriate interactions to take place? Kusumi decided that the only way forward was to study the movement of single molecules. He found a way to attach a colloidal gold particle, 20\u201340 nanometres in diameter, to a membrane protein and video its movement. Using a rat kidney cell he made his first observation of apparent hop diffusion 3 . The gold particle whizzed around in a small area of the membrane and then seemed to jump into a neighbouring area, rather than moving randomly at a more sedate speed throughout the whole membrane or being confined to a raft. He reasoned that the compartments could be defined by fences made from actin filaments of the cytoskeleton within the cell pushing against the underside of the membrane. This concept extended the theoretical work of Michael Sheetz, a biophysicist at Columbia University in New York, who in 1983 had first proposed that transmembrane proteins might be constrained by the cytoskeletal network in red blood cells 4 . But when Kusumi looked for hopping in many other types of cells, including red blood cells, he couldn't find it. His data showed proteins that seemed to move freely around the membrane, without lingering in areas between supposed fences. He knew that his camera's spatial resolution was good enough to pick up the expected jittering movement within confined areas; but maybe, he thought, it wasn't quick enough. To find out, he needed a faster camera \u2014 much faster. \u201cI was certain that explosion researchers would be using very fast cameras. I remembered that scientists developing the atomic bomb in the Manhattan project used them to observe explosions,\u201d he says. He found several modern models on the market, but they were for areas such as explosion research and were not specifically designed for microscopic work. Kusumi acquired one anyway, which at 40,000 frames per second gave a 25-microsecond resolution \u2014 1,000 times faster than his previous camera. \u201cWe had to integrate the camera with our microscopes and then optimize the system through a lot of tinkering,\u201d he says. \u2018Tinkering\u2019 is too small a word for what was required, which included improving contrast, introducing a light source that kept the camera, the microscope and the cells happy, and, most important, speeding up data analysis. Kusumi says that without his multidisciplinary team of 20 researchers, ranging from computer scientists to physicists and biochemists, it would not have been possible to create the complex machine that takes his apparently simple films. \n               Hop and glory \n             With the new system in place, his team was soon seeing what looked like hop diffusion in many different types of cell. On average the group would see a hop every 1\u20131,000 milliseconds and membrane compartments of about 30\u2013200 nanometres across. This explained the difference between diffusion speeds in natural membranes and artificial ones. Proteins move at the same fast speed in both, but their progress is hindered by fences in the natural system, making their long-distance diffusion slower. \u201cThe hops were being missed in video recording, which has a resolution of only 30 milliseconds,\u201d says Kusumi. \u201cA lot can happen in 30 milliseconds.\u201d \u201cWe were delighted, but we still knew that an enigma remained,\u201d says Kusumi. It is not just proteins within the membrane that move \u2014 the lipids move too. And these also seem to diffuse more slowly in natural cells than in artificial systems, even though the outer layer of lipids is well out of reach of the cell skeleton underneath. It proved much harder to label and track lipids compared with proteins. But after two years and thousands of films, Kusumi succeeded in getting statistically sound results, showing lipids hopping too 5  \u2014 they move, he found, at a rate of one hop every 1\u2013100 milliseconds. This, he thinks, is because some proteins that pass right through the membrane are anchored against the cytoskeletal fence, and so act as fence posts or pickets. These mark out corrals that help to confine the membrane lipids. In 2001, Kusumi began to present his results, his interpretation and his general view of how a membrane keeps its house in order. At the same time, other work from his lab was adding weight to his theory 6 . Experiments with electron microscope computed tomography of the cytoskeleton, sophisticated spectroscopes and other high-tech instruments such as molecular tweezers 7 , he says, corroborated the size of the fenced-in corrals. And, Kusumi adds, the force required to drag a molecule over a fence is in line with what the hypothesis would predict. What he did not see was evidence that rafts played any part in initiating cell signalling. Kusumi's grand hypothesis, created with self-assembled high-tech equipment, really shook things up. \u201cThere is no doubt that Kusumi has had a dramatic effect on the field of membrane biophysics,\u201d says Ken Jacobson, a cell biologist at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. \u201cHe has pushed the field on several fronts.\u201d Jacobson, who also tracks single particles in cell membranes, but using a slower-speed video camera, comments that Kusumi's hop-diffusion model has been accepted to a \u201cmodest degree\u201d in the field. One of the major obstacles to full acceptance, he says, is that no other lab currently has the high-speed equipment to confirm the results independently. \n               Golden retriever \n             Another worry is the use of a relatively large gold particle for tracking \u2014 a particle that may be larger than some of the corrals. Kusumi argues that he carries out extensive, time-consuming control studies to ensure that the dot of gold is pulling only a single molecule. In his research community Kusumi is known for his obsessive rigour \u2014 most people have the greatest confidence in his technical prowess, says Jacobson. \u201cBut even so, you always have that nagging doubt that somehow a 40-nanometre particle may be affecting the results in some way.\u201d There are rivals to the fence-and-picket model that might explain the curious dynamics that Kusumi observes, adds Jitu Mayor, a cell biologist at the National Centre for Biological Sciences in Bangalore. Some scientists argue that the simple crowding of proteins in living membranes could account for the relatively slow protein movement, he says. But Mayor argues that no one else has tackled the problems as thoroughly as Kusumi, coming up with a broad, internally consistent hypothesis and then working to validate it. \u201cThe rivals just don't make testable predictions,\u201d he says. Kusumi is not only dedicated to putting his theory through the wringer of experiment; he is also willing to sit on the fence over the question of rafts. Once a cell has begun the process of cell signalling \u2014 after the proteins required have already come together \u2014 he says he does see some evidence for the raft hypothesis. \u201cWe see molecules forming clusters when they are stimulated by a signal, so they can be seen as rafts,\u201d he says, referring to unpublished work. \u201cBut we don't see them in non-stimulated cell membranes.\u201d Kai Simons, a director at the Max Planck Society for cell biology in Dresden, Germany, and one of the strongest proponents of raft theory, is mollified by this. If Kusumi can't see rafts before cell signalling, says Simons, perhaps that's because the gold particle is perturbing the system too much. In the case of stimulated cell membranes, he says, he and Kusumi are happily in agreement. Kusumi takes his critics seriously. But he laughs about it too, throwing out asides: \u201cnew ideas can be difficult,\u201d he says, and \u201cphysicists are fond of brownian motion.\u201d So Kusumi will forge ahead, extending his work to look at the interactions between cell membrane proteins and nanomaterials being developed for tissue transplantation. He has just moved from the University of Nagoya to a new centre, whose name reflects his tendency to work at the edge: the University of Kyoto's Institute of Frontier Medical Sciences. It isn't the first time Kusumi has shifted his workplace \u2014 he has moved once every eight years to a new city. \u201cI lead my life according to hop-diffusion principles,\u201d he laughs. Thankfully, he's easier to catch on camera. \n                     http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/nrm1102 \n                   \n                     http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/35036052 \n                   \n                     http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/35036052 \n                   \n                     Kusumi lab: \n                   \n                     Cell-membrane debate: \n                   \n                     Mayor lab: \n                   \n                     Jacobson lab: \n                   \n                     Simons lab: \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

But solar-sail pioneer Lou Friedman is ready for anything as spacecraft Cosmos 1 prepares to take on the Sun and the space agencies. Tony Reichhardt reports.  This is a story about patience. Not just one man's patience, although Lou Friedman has waited half his life to get a solar sail into space. Futurists, too, have been dreaming about this technology for nearly a century and have yet to see it demonstrated. In April, if all goes to plan, a 600-square-metre Mylar sail called Cosmos 1, which looks more like a windmill than a starship, will prove that a spacecraft can be propelled by sunlight alone. First, though, it will have to be launched into orbit on a converted missile from a Russian nuclear submarine in the Barents Sea. Cosmos 1 is privately funded by the Planetary Society, a US space-advocacy group based in Pasadena, California, which Friedman heads, but it was built in Moscow by the ex-Soviet aerospace company NPO Lavochkin. After the sail reaches its initial 800-kilometre orbit and unfolds its eight triangular vanes, ground controllers will tilt the vanes like sailors feeling for the wind. A slight boost to the spacecraft's orbit is all they need to demonstrate propulsion by light pressure. It may take a few days, but the Cosmos team won't mind waiting. Solar sails are not for people in a hurry. They accelerate almost imperceptibly at first, as photons of light bounce off their enormous reflective surface, imparting momentum. But, unlike conventional rockets, they can accelerate continuously, and keep accelerating as long as the Sun is shining, without needing a drop of fuel. \n               Light speed \n             After one day, the velocity increase for an interplanetary sail would be a modest 160 kilometres per hour. After 100 days, the sail would be moving at 16,000 km h \u22121 . In three years it would be travelling 160,000 km h \u22121 , three times faster than the Voyager spacecraft now exiting the Solar System, and fast enough to reach Pluto in less than five years \u2014 half the time the NASA New Horizons mission will take to reach Pluto. This is why science fiction writers love solar sails \u2014 as do aerospace engineers, at least in theory. In the 1970s, Friedman was a project manager at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in Pasadena, California, where he led the conceptual design of a US mission to Halley's Comet, using a gigantic 640,000-m 2  sail. The idea was shot down by NASA management as too risky. \u201cIn retrospect it was too audacious,\u201d Friedman admits today, \u201cand the schedule was unrealistic.\u201d After leaving JPL, Friedman co-founded the Planetary Society with scientists Carl Sagan and Bruce Murray in 1980. While pushing the society's agenda of international space cooperation, he built solid friendships and working relationships with Russian space scientists and engineers, at a time when such relations were viewed with suspicion. Later, it made economic and technical sense for the Planetary Society to turn to Russia for help on the solar-sail project. The missile launch was a bargain; NPO Lavochkin was already working on inflatable spacecraft (the masts that hold the Cosmos 1 sail must inflate in space), and Russian interest in solar sails dates back to the visionary Konstantin Tsiolkovsky, who wrote about them as early as 1921. Right now, Friedman is trying to balance his excitement at getting this far, with more realistic expectations. The project's tiny US$4-million budget (\u201cNASA would spend almost that much on the paper studies,\u201d he says) has meant cutting corners on certain materials and the number of design reviews. But the team is made of \u201ccapable, experienced people\u201d who have tried to anticipate everything that could go wrong. After one technical review in Moscow, recalls Friedman, a Russian consultant gave Cosmos 1 as much as a 70% chance of succeeding. \u201cI said: \u2018You give it 70? Man, I'll take that!\u2019.\u201d Unfortunately, the team missed its chance to test the sail's deployment on a suborbital launch in 2001, when the spacecraft failed to separate from its rocket, and both were lost at sea. Instead of repeating this short flight, Friedman and his colleagues decided to go straight to orbit for their next try.  Although NASA wouldn't approach a high-risk project in this way, the agency will be cheering Cosmos from the sidelines, says Tim Van Sant of the Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland. Van Sant manages technology development for NASA's Sun\u2013Earth Connection programme. His office has long contemplated solar sails for missions that cannot be done with conventional propulsion. Placing a spacecraft in a close polar orbit around the Sun, for example, requires enormous amounts of rocket fuel to fight the inward pull of solar gravity. Solar sails would act as natural brakes, and would never run out of fuel. \n               Catching the breeze \n             But there is a big gap between dreaming and doing. Most plans for solar sails have never got anywhere near the Sun. In 1992 there was talk of an international solar-sailing regatta to celebrate the 500th anniversary of Columbus's voyage to America. Groups including the Pasadena-based World Space Foundation got as far as building and testing sails on the ground, using a mix of professional and amateur labour, but their money dried up. More recently, a Texas-based group called Team Encounter announced plans to attach paying customers' messages, drawings, photographs and DNA samples to a sail and send it off into interstellar space. None of these projects has come close to launching. In terms of flight experience with solar sails, Japan is the world leader until Cosmos 1 launches. Last August the Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) conducted a brief suborbital test on a sounding rocket, during which two 10-m sails unfurled from a mast to form a pinwheel shape. In May the agency will test a 20-m sail suspended from a scientific balloon at an altitude of 35 km. JAXA's ultimate goal is a hybrid propulsion system combining solar sailing with ion-drive engines. One proposed JAXA mission would combine a 50-m solar sail with an ion drive to place a probe in orbit around Jupiter's poles and fly past several asteroids. No one, though, has got as close to orbit as Friedman is today. Even if the sail deploys on cue, he's not sure when he should celebrate. \u201cIt could be a very tenuous success,\u201d he says, as the mission team tries to control its sail and push it into a higher orbit. Of the many technical challenges facing solar sails, Friedman counts dynamics as perhaps the most vexing. No one knows exactly how stable it will be, or whether it will twist and curl on itself like a flimsy kite in a strong wind.  If Cosmos 1 reaches a higher orbit and meets all its other mission objectives, it will be used for one last, futuristic experiment. University of California physicist and science fiction writer Gregory Benford, along with his brother James, president of Microwave Sciences in Lafayette, California, will aim a 450-kilowatt microwave beam from a radio antenna in the Mojave Desert towards the sail. They hope the beam will give an extra push to the sail. Someday, that method may be used to propel gossamer sails more quickly to other planets, and perhaps even other stars. \n               On the right tack \n             A successful Cosmos 1 mission would give a gentle push to solar-sail projects within the space agencies. The earliest NASA could fly a solar sail is 2009 on the Space Technology 9 demonstration mission, although other technologies will be competing for that flight. Among NASA's long-term solar-sail proposals are the Particle Acceleration Solar Orbiter, which would orbit close enough to the Sun to keep a steady gaze on active solar regions, and a Solar Polar Imager for studying the Sun's higher latitudes. NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration would also like to put weather stations in stable orbits between Earth and the Sun to give advance warning of sunstorms. These would need sails three to five times bigger than Cosmos 1. The European Space Agency is interested in solar sails too, for reasons similar to NASA's \u2014 to place an orbiter around the poles of the Sun. The agency is also studying another mission concept called Earthguard to visit near-Earth asteroids. Although no solar-sail missions have yet been approved, Van Sant is spending about $10 million a year laying the technological groundwork. This year two pioneers of solar-sail development, L'Garde of Tustin, California, and ABLE Engineering of Goleta, California, will test different designs for 20-m sails in a giant vacuum chamber at NASA's Plum Brook facility in Ohio. ABLE's sail is made of an extremely thin new polymer called CP-1, only 2.5 micrometres thick \u2014 half as thick as the aluminized Mylar on Cosmos 1. \u201cIf you sneeze, you'll send this stuff across the table,\u201d says Van Sant. Thinner and lighter is better when it comes to solar sails, but flimsy films are also more prone to tearing. Even the reinforced sails of Cosmos 1 won't last forever: within a month of launch they will begin to degrade in the harsh sunlight. But the short flight should be long enough to demonstrate the principle of solar sailing, and if successful will open the heavens to other solar-powered craft. \n                     http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/35073790 \n                   \n                     Cosmos 1 \n                   \n                     2004 Solar Sail Technology and Applications Conference: \n                   \n                     Solar Sail news \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

But can this advice really make a difference?  Nature 's reporters sift through the heady mix of politics and science to get a taste of things to come.  \u201cIf you follow this diet, you're going to lose weight, you're going to be healthy and you're going to be able to improve your quality of life ... it's scientifically based, but it's also common sense.\u201d Another diet guru flogging their snake-oil prescription for the servings of fat, carbohydrate, protein and other nutrients needed to be healthy and slim? No. This was Tommy Thompson, then US Secretary of Health, speaking on 12 January at the release of Uncle Sam's very own diet book,  Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2005 . The guidelines, revised every five years, inevitably amount to a compromise between nutrition advocates and the food and agriculture lobbies. Yet this time they largely have pleased even staunch critics of government food policy. \u201cThey look to me like the strongest dietary guidelines yet produced,\u201d said Michael Jacobson, who heads the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a nutrition advocacy group in Washington DC, at a press conference after the release. But in the aftermath, a philosophical divide has emerged. On the one hand is the view, expressed by Thompson, that the government's role is to put out information about what constitutes healthy eating, but that it's up to individuals whether they follow the advice. The other take is that the government must do more, not only to educate people about food choice, but to ensure a food supply that accurately reflects its own dietary advice. For those who take this view, the guidelines don't go far enough \u2014 and they say that buried in the fine print are concessions to the food industry that threaten to weaken the impact of the advice. The guidelines \u2014 a joint effort by the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) and US Department of Agriculture (USDA) \u2014 were first issued in 1980, and form a reference for US eating habits. They underpin government nutritional policy and federal food programmes, including school meals. And they will be summarized graphically in a new \u2018food guidance system\u2019, which will be released within weeks to replace the \u2018food pyramid\u2019 introduced in 1992. \n               Fat fighters \n             Previous guidelines focused on cutting consumption of the saturated fats that cause chronic conditions such as heart disease. But the top priority now is to roll back the obesity epidemic that is causing a surge in conditions such as type-2 diabetes. About two-thirds of US adults are deemed overweight or obese by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, Georgia. Consequently, the biggest change in the new guidelines is the emphasis on restoring energy balance to people's diets. The message is that there is no getting round the laws of thermodynamics. If your calorie intake exceeds your energy output, you will gain weight. To this end, the guidelines advise a close watch on calories and 30\u201360 minutes of exercise most days of the week; 90 minutes to shed unwanted flab.  That's old hat to dieters, but the surprise this time was the explicit statement that the healthiest way to reduce calories is to avoid added sugars, certain fats and alcohol, all of which are high in calories but low in essential nutrients. In the past, such a message has been all but taboo. The previous guidelines say only that added sugars may contribute to weight gain. And in January 2004, the Bush administration lobbied against phrasing in the World Health Organization's dietary advice that urged people to eat fewer sugary and other high-calorie foods. To hammer its point home, the scientific advisory committee behind the guidelines turned to the concept of \u2018discretionary calories\u2019: the number of junk-food calories you can eat daily without gaining weight. A typical sedentary person who burns 2,200 calories per day needs to eat about 1,910 calories of healthy food to meet their basic nutritional needs. This leaves 290 calories for a treat, such as beer and potato crisps with late-night TV.  The idea, say committee members, is to raise people's consciousness about overeating without denying them their favourite snacks. Even a relatively modest reduction of between 50 and 300 calories per day could prevent most new cases of obesity, particularly among children. \u201cIf we could achieve this it would be the major crowning achievement of the guidelines,\u201d says Alice Lichtenstein, a cardiovascular researcher at Tufts University School of Medicine in Boston, Massachusetts, who sat on the scientific committee for the 2000 guidelines. \n               Taste of the future \n             Also new this year is an emphasis on fibre- and nutrient-rich whole grains instead of refined grains, and a recommendation to eat nearly twice the quantity of fruit and vegetables suggested in the 2000 version, as a way to lower the risk of certain cancers, type-2 diabetes, stroke and obesity. And the guidelines now clearly distinguish between different types of fat. Gone is the blanket low-fat creed of the past 20 years. In its place is advice to avoid saturated fats, which are found in red meat, for example, and  trans -fats, which are abundant in processed foods. At the same time, moderate amounts of healthy fats, such as olive oil, are recommended. The stronger wording in the new guidelines is partly the result of changes to the drafting procedure that gave scientific advisers greater autonomy. In 2003, the DHHS and USDA appointed 13 nutrition scientists to the Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee and asked them to compile a report from the latest scientific literature. Bureaucrats at the two agencies then reviewed this report, published in the  Federal Register  in August 2004, and considered comments from interested parties. They drafted the guidelines themselves, and communications specialists transformed them into the slick, 84-page brochures released in January. Separating the two phases made the scientific basis of the guidelines more transparent, says Janet King, chair of the committee and a researcher at the Children's Hospital Oakland Research Institute in Oakland, California. In the past, the committee members had to write the actual guidelines, which forced them to consider factors such as how easy they were for a lay reader to understand. The previous committee spent ages, for example, debating whether to advise people to \u2018limit\u2019 or \u2018moderate\u2019 their salt intake, King says. The new set-up also made the committee less of a target for pressure from industry and policy-makers. \u201cIt shielded us,\u201d she says. But the literature is far from definitive about the best diet. There are few long-term or well-controlled clinical nutrition trials available, so the committee relied heavily on epidemiological and observational studies (see \u2018How is science converted to dietary advice?\u2019  page 798  and  Nature   428 , 252\u2013254; 2004 ). These uncertainties left plenty of room for quibbling about the wording of the guidelines, say critics of the process, who have been quick to point out the fingerprints of the food industry in the small print. One charge levelled at this and previous guidelines is that they tell consumers only what foods they ought to eat \u2014 such as lean cuts of meat and low-fat dairy products \u2014 without spelling out foods to avoid, such as processed snacks, fast food or red meat dripping with saturated fat. \u201cThey're saying the right thing but not quite giving it the teeth it needs,\u201d says Carlos Camargo, himself a member of the scientific committee and an epidemiologist at the Harvard School of Public Health in Boston. \n               Cream of the crop \n             A more specific industry influence, critics contend, is the recommendation to consume more dairy products \u2014 the equivalent of three cups of milk a day, up from between two and three cups last time. They say that this increase provides most people with unnecessary calories, that it is possible to achieve recommended intakes of calcium and other nutrients through other means, and that it fails to take into account studies linking diets high in dairy products with an increased risk of prostate cancer. The increase is \u201cone of the strongest influences of the food industry\u201d in the report, says Walter Willett, a nutrition epidemiologist at the Harvard School of Public Health. Concerns have also been raised about the recommendation on  trans -fats. The scientific report said that these should not exceed 1% of daily energy intake, but the guidelines say only that  trans -fat intake should be kept \u201cas low as possible\u201d. According to Camargo, this was the most significant departure from the committee's recommendations, allowing those putting together school meals, for example, to make only a token effort to reduce the fat. Nutrition researchers critical of the food industry charge that the language was softened under industry pressure to avoid costly revamping of production processes that rely on cheap vegetable oils. For its part, the food industry says it is just trying to keep the guidelines fair. Industry representatives, as well as other interest groups, were invited to provide the committee with written and oral comments during the literature-review phase and to make comments after its report was published. The National Dairy Council, for instance, presented evidence supporting its argument that dairy foods help people meet their calcium and potassium requirements. And the Grocery Manufacturers of America argued that added sugars help increase the palatability of some nutritionally valuable foods. \n               Reaping benefits \n             But industry has other avenues of influence open to it. One is through USDA, which, by the nature of its mission, is more attuned to farmers' interests than to public-health needs. \u201cIt's the wrong agency to do this, and a blatant conflict of interest,\u201d says Marion Nestle, a prominent critic of the food industry working at New York University. A second and more opaque route is through lobbying \u2014 an integral part of the US political system \u2014 where industry and others try to influence agency officials by, for example, providing them with relevant documents and making personal contacts. Thompson openly discussed industry's influence at the launch of the guidelines. \u201cThe food industry has spent a great deal of time and money appearing in and observing all of the negotiations and all of the testimonies that went into compiling the guidelines,\u201d he said. \u201cThey come in and meet with me on a regular basis.\u201d Although industry may have won key concessions, anyone who follows the guidelines strictly will probably end up in better health. The reason some nutrition experts are still not happy is that they anticipate little time or money will be put into spreading or enforcing the advice.  \u201cWhat is lacking is will on the part of the government and Congress to convert the guidelines into new health and agriculture policies and programmes,\u201d says Jacobson. He asserts that doing so would step on major interests such as restaurants, as well as the corn, sugar, processed-food and salt industries. What is needed, he says, are hard-hitting, mass-media campaigns to help shift consumer demand to healthier products. Some also advocate legislation to subsidize healthy foods, regulate advertising aimed at children, and to require calorie information to be displayed on restaurant menus. So far there is little sign that strong implementation is coming. Instead, the US administration has emphasized that diet is a matter of personal choice. \u201cIt's up to the individual to make the right decisions,\u201d said Thompson in January. But Ricardo Uauy, an expert on health and nutrition at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, argues that it is nearly impossible to choose carbohydrates or fats \u201cwisely\u201d, as the guidelines recommend, when many children's cereals contain as much as 40% sugar, for instance, and processed foods account for 80% of the  trans -fats that people eat. Nor is it easy for people to choose foods with little salt \u2014 as the guidelines advise to lower blood pressure \u2014 when 80% of their salt intake comes from processed foods. \n               Hard to swallow \n             Indeed, the US diet will have to change radically to meet the new advice. At present, many Americans eat a diet that resembles the food pyramid turned upside down, with too much salt and added sugars and fats, and not enough grains, fruit and vegetables. Without substantial changes in the practices of the food industry the guidelines will have little impact, predicts Uauy.  Others say that the food industry is already going through a period of evolution spurred in part by consumer demand. The public discussion of obesity and related health problems has led to increased awareness among consumers and greater scrutiny of the industry by nutrition advocates and the media. Many fast-food chains have updated their image with healthier fare such as salads and yoghurts. Last year, McDonald's phased out its \u2018supersize\u2019 meal options. And PepsiCo has removed  trans -fats from some of its snacks and has introduced a greater range of bottled waters and fruit juices as alternatives to sugary drinks. At the same time, food companies are not about to abandon their calorie-laden products as long as demand for them exists. \u201cIf people want French fries and a double cheeseburger we're gonna give them that,\u201d says Bob Goldin, executive vice-president of Technomic, a food-industry consulting and research firm based in Chicago. But industry experts say that the shift towards healthier foods is more than cosmetic. Health and whole foods are one of the biggest growth areas in an otherwise saturated market, and companies are scrambling for a share of it. They predict that consumer demand for healthier food will grow, partly as a result of the dietary guidelines. \u201cIt will be a driving factor in the industry going forward, because that is what the consumer will ultimately want,\u201d Goldin says. Certainly Americans are hungry for food advice, if $2 billion in diet book sales last year is any indication. But whether it will take more than a few books and a gentle nudge from their federal health department to get them to eat better and slim down is still up in the air. \n               http://www.healthierus.gov/dietaryguidelines \n             \n                     http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/428252a \n                   \n                     http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/news050110-15 \n                   \n                     http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/news041025-11 \n                   \n                     www.nature.com/news/infocus/food.html \n                   \n                     US Dietary Guidelines \n                   \n                     Oldways Preservation and Exchange Trust: \n                   \n                     Center for Science in the Public Interest: \n                   \n                     National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey: \n                   \n                     Dietary Reference Intakes: \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

There are hundreds of guides out there \u2014 often providing conflicting instructions. Deciding what advice to take means wrestling with a number of tough questions. \n               How is science converted to dietary advice? \n              To make the jump from scientific data to specific recommendations for a healthy diet \u2014 that everyone should now eat nine servings of fruit and vegetables a day, for instance \u2014 the scientists on the US Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee turned to computer modelling. They mixed and matched foods from the traditional groups \u2014 fruits, vegetables, grains, meat and beans, dairy foods, fats and sweets \u2014 to come up with combinations that met nutritional requirements put forward by the Institute of Medicine's Dietary Reference Intakes. This gave them a series of food patterns for a range of daily calorie intake levels from 1,000 to 3,200, in increments of 200. These model diets were designed to boost nutrients that are often too low in US diets, such as vitamin E, calcium, magnesium, potassium, fibre and vitamin A. In a twist, the nutritional value of each food group was calculated to reflect what Americans actually eat, rather than as a simple average of all the foods in the group. For example, broccoli accounts for more than half of the greens Americans eat, and spinach about a fifth, according to the 1999\u20132002 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. So the value of the greens group as a whole was calculated as having 0.53 of the nutritional values of broccoli and 0.20 of those of spinach. The remainder was taken as the combined average of other greens. Committee members say that this approach allowed them to make recommendations with practical value to Americans, who are not likely to radically shift the proportions of foods they eat within the food groups.  But the result did not entirely satisfy nutrition professionals. Dena Bravata, a physician and obesity researcher at Stanford University in California, says that although the guidelines are valuable she would have preferred them to be \u201cbased more on the scientific evidence rather than this hybrid approach\u201d. The average US diet is hardly ideal, she says, and knowing what food combinations are optimal would allow patients and clinicians to create individualized diets based on the best available evidence. The approach has its disadvantages, the committee admits. Many people in the United States don't get enough vitamin E, for example, so one might have expected the guidelines to recommend eating more nuts and oils, which are rich in this vitamin. But Americans eat very few real nuts (peanuts, although popular, are actually legumes) and use oils that are low in vitamin E, so nuts and oils ended up with low vitamin E scores in the computation. This meant acrobatic accounting to boost other food groups with average levels of vitamin E. \n               Declan Butler \n             \n               Which countries or cultures have the best diets? \n             Several groups are in the running. Many people consider the traditional Mediterranean diet to be one of the healthiest. But times are changing. With the globalization of the food market, processed foods are creeping into traditional diets at the same time that physical activity is declining in many parts of the world. More and more, the people with the best diets are those who make a concerted effort. In collaboration with the Harvard School of Public Health, Oldways, a Boston-based non-profit organization that promotes healthy eating, has assembled several traditional diets into food-guide pyramids, following the shape of the official eating guide set out by the US Department of Agriculture. These take traditional dietary patterns into account, as well as data from clinical and epidemiological research. The Oldways Mediterranean pyramid is based on the diet of Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain around 1960, a time when people in those countries lived longer than their northern European neighbours and were less likely to develop heart disease. Their daily fare included wholegrain bread, pasta, rice, fruit, beans, vegetables, cheese, yoghurt and that quintessential Mediterranean ingredient, olive oil. They also ate fish, poultry, eggs and sweets weekly. But red meat, with its artery-clogging saturated fat, was consumed less often. Today, these eating habits are gradually being abandoned, and at the same time the Mediterranean advantage in life expectancy has decreased 1  and obesity is on the rise 2 . But the diet itself remains popular among those who try to eat right. As a result, diet-conscious people in places that lack strong nutritional traditions may be candidates for the best eaters today. \u201cMiddle-aged, educated women in California eat particularly healthy diets,\u201d says Martijn Katan, nutrition scientist at the Wageningen Centre for Food Sciences in the Netherlands. If effort is essential, certainly few countries have tried harder to eat right than Finland. In the early 1970s, Finnish men had the highest rate of heart disease in the world. Their diet consisted of large amounts of whole milk, cheese and salt, with very little in the way of fruit and vegetables. A national programme of education and changes to the food supply over three decades has vastly improved the national diet. Today, the mortality from coronary heart disease in working-age men has been reduced to a quarter of what it was in the 1970s (ref.  3 ). \n               Achim Schneider \n             \n               There must be a natural diet for humans \u2014 what did we evolve to eat? \n             The good news is that evolution teaches us that humans can eat just about any mix of the basic food groups. During evolution, we have colonized almost every ecosystem on Earth, and adapted to what was available; from Arctic populations eating almost exclusively animal protein, to villagers in the peaks of the Andes living largely on grains and cereals. We evolved as \u201cflexible eaters\u201d, says William Leonard, an anthropologist at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois, and an expert on diet in evolution. Taken from this evolutionary vantage point, arguments in diet books over whether a low-fat, high-carbohydrate diet is better than a high-protein, low-carb diet make no sense, he says. Alice Lichtenstein, a cardiovascular researcher at Tufts University School of Medicine in Boston who sat on the scientific committee that produced the 2000 US dietary guidelines, agrees. \u201cA variety of diets are possible from an evolutionary point of view,\u201d she says. The bad news is that evolution has also left us with a genetic legacy: our brains and genes are hardwired to seek out as much energy as possible for the least physical effort. This served humans well during millennia when starvation was a constant threat to our survival, but is not adapted to the modern world where high-calorie foods are a phone order or short drive away.  Evidence for this can be found in the Arctic, for instance. Indigenous people who maintain a traditional lifestyle eat a great deal of meat, yet they have low blood lipid levels, which is a risk factor in heart disease, and enjoy good cardiovascular health. The explanation, Leonard proposes, is that their rate of metabolism is raised as a result of vigorous physical activity and in response to their frozen environment. But their relatives who have adopted a more sedentary way of life, and a Western diet that has more processed foods and less meat, have significantly increased blood lipid levels and higher rates of obesity and cardiovascular disease 4 . Such findings have implications for the hunt for \u2018fat genes\u2019. Although some genes may be linked to the risk of getting fat, obesity is less the result of individual genetic propensities than of the shift in environmental conditions, says Ricardo Uauy, an expert on public health and nutrition at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. \u201cThe past 50 years is too short to modify our evolutionary trajectory.\u201d \n               Declan Butler \n             \n               Do we have enough of the right kind of food for everyone on the planet? \n             Certainly if one considers the world's chronically undernourished, who now number some 850 million people 5 , the answer is no. But the surprise is that many of those who are better off or who live in countries with abundant food supplies still fail to get the nutrients they need, and may even be overweight in spite of this. The problem of chronic hunger occurs almost entirely in poor countries. The condition is particularly lethal to children, of whom more than 3.7 million died in 2002 from the health consequences of being underweight. Another estimated 850,000 died because their diet \u2014 although sufficiently rich in calories \u2014 did not contain enough vital components such as iron, vitamin A and zinc 5 . That lack of proper nutrients is also a phenomenon in wealthy countries, where food insecurity, if not starvation, is surprisingly common. In the United States, for example, 12.6 million households (about 11%) fall short of basic food needs at some point during the year. In about a quarter of those cases, people fail to get government food aid or find private charities to make up the difference, and so go hungry 6 . Ironically, poverty and obesity often go hand in hand in developed countries 7 . \u201cObesity is a disease of the poor in rich countries, whereas in poor countries obesity is a disease of the rich,\u201d says Katan. A key factor is that junk food tends to offer the most calories for the least money. \u201cThis is the single most important factor influencing food choice,\u201d says Marion Nestle, professor of nutrition, food studies and public health at New York University. In US supermarkets, for instance, a 270-calorie doughnut costs about 75\u00a2, the same as 125-calorie apple. The ready availability of processed and fast foods in many corners of the globe is now making them the natural choice, particularly for the poor and uneducated. Apart from being cheap, they have a natural appeal, Nestle says. \u201cEating highly refined food rich in sugar and fat is a kind of joy, which poor people do not frequently have,\u201d she says. Although it is true that wholesome foods are also available throughout the industrialized world, evidence suggests that even slight inconvenience is enough to put people off buying them. A representative study involving participants in the US food-stamp programme shows that people tend to buy more fruit the closer they live to a supermarket 8 . \n               Achim Schneider \n             Reprints and Permissions"},

But despite the diversity of design to be found in pictorial food guides from around the world, the core advice remains the same: eat your peas and porridge, limit your bacon and eggs. In Canada's rainbow, for instance, breads and cereals occupy the outermost \u2014 and therefore longest \u2014 curve of the arc. This band is coloured golden yellow to represent grain. Vegetables and fruit are next in green, followed by dairy in blue and meat in the diminutive, innermost red band. Of course, in real rainbows, even Canadian ones, red comes before yellow. Putting the colours in that order comes a bit closer to what real Canadians eat. According to data from the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, Canadians, like other North Americans, get more than twice as many calories from meat and fish as from fruit and vegetables. That ratio is fairly common in parts of the world where meat is readily available. The Chinese, avid consumers of pork, have a similar proportion in their diets. This is despite the advice of the Food Guide Pagoda, which has grain in its foundation level, and fruit and veg just above it. Nearly every official food guide emphasizes grains and cereals as the foundation of a healthy diet, and that's one recommendation the world as a whole has no trouble living up to. In the United States and Europe, grains and cereals make up about a quarter of the average diet. In Asia, where rice is a staple, they are anywhere from 50% to 60% of daily calories. Diets in most other regions fall somewhere in the middle. Although the basic recommendations are the same, each pyramid, rainbow or circle tends to reflect the nation's unique food culture. The Mexican food circle has an entire wedge devoted to beans. The Chinese pagoda's food depictions include a bowl of rice and a head of bok choy, and the German food circle features photographs of hearty whole-grain breads. But no food guide seems to take adequate account of the irrepressible human sweet tooth. Sweets are listed along with fats as only for occasional consumption in most guides. And several make no mention of sweets at all, including those from China, Sweden, Germany and Portugal (see J. Painter, J.-H. Rah and Y.-K. Lee  J. Am. Diet. Assoc.   102,  483\u2013489; 2002). Even so, North Africans get 9% of their calories from sugar, Europeans 11%, and Americans a cloying 18%. Reprints and Permissions"},

This crusade has been phenomenally successful, but has placed Akunyili's life in danger. Peter Aldhous caught up with her on a recent trip to the United States. \n               How did you come to your job of regulating Nigeria's drug supply? \n               I got sick, and was given \u00a312,000 (US$23,000) by my employers for surgery in London. When I got there, it was diagnosed as irritable bowel syndrome, and I didn't need the surgery. So I returned the money. People said: \u201cWhat type of woman is this? This is rare.\u201d Later, Nigeria's President Olusegun Obasanjo heard about this, and asked me about NAFDAC, the National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control. I said: \u201cThere is no system that cannot be corrected, if there is someone who is determined.\u201d After that, he gave me the job of director-general. \n               Did you have any personal experience with counterfeit drugs? \n             In Nigeria, there is hardly any family that does not have a history of somebody dying of fake drugs. My youngest sister died of diabetes in 1988. I'm a pharmacologist. I know it was fake insulin. \n               How bad were things when you took on your post? \n             I did not know the enormity of the problem until I came on board in April 2001. There was a total failure of the regulatory process. Fake and substandard drugs flooded Nigeria. Multinational drug companies divested and left. Our local drug manufacturers were closing up shop. How could they compete with somebody who is compressing chalk to make tablets, or adding olive oil into capsules and calling it multivitamins? People who had money went abroad for treatment. But the poor people were at the mercy of these criminals. \n               What did you do to tackle these problems? \n             We started with public enlightenment. Every two weeks, we publish the differences between fake and genuine drugs in Nigerian newspapers. We also use the radio. Most of the fake drugs in Nigeria come from India and China. In these countries, we established independent analysts to test drugs and give certification papers. Then we beefed up surveillance at all ports of entry into Nigeria. Now, if an aircraft arrives and we find fake drugs, it is grounded. We have also devised systematic surveillance of markets and shops. We closed Aba market, in the southeast, for six months in 2003 for selling large quantities of unregistered, fake and substandard drugs. It's a serious thing to close a market. They apologized on radio and TV. Now they are fighting among themselves to keep it clean \u2014 if anybody makes NAFDAC close this market again, that person would be killed. \n               How many lives have been saved through your work? \n             Many deaths are not reported in Nigeria, and our people, culturally, are not into autopsy. But it must be millions. In 2004, we found that the incidence of unregistered drugs had fallen by 80% over two years. \n               How have the criminals responded? \n             They fought back! They put fetish objects in my offices. They put blood on feathers. I guess they were doing that to intimidate me. Then they started phone calls. They called my husband and warned: \u201cYour family can easily be wiped out.\u201d My son, who was in high school in Benin, was clever enough to tell the students that I was not his mother. But that really pained me. In August 2002, they went to our lab in Lagos and totally vandalized everything. I don't know what they used \u2014 maybe iron bars. The policeman on duty, they cut him to pieces with machetes. In March 2004, they set our headquarters ablaze and, a few days later, they burnt down our labs in Kaduna.  One of the big barons arranged to assassinate me in my hometown in December 2003, as we were driving through. At first, I thought the sound was some Christmas fireworks, until our back windscreen shattered. A bullet went through my scarf, grazed my scalp, and went out through the front windscreen. I was crying, and the policeman in front of my car was on a walkie-talkie, telling my driver to keep going. A bus driver who was trying to block the shooters had his bus riddled with bullets. The man died on the spot. \n               Are you tempted to resign? \n             If I leave, it means that these criminals have triumphed. This, coupled with the trust that the president has in me, makes me feel that I have to struggle to the end. I'll be five years in the job in April 2006. By the grace of God, if I'm still alive, I will not go for renewal. \n               Will someone continue your work? \n             I really pray, and I'm also training some people.

But now they face a new genetic bottleneck in the wake of Hurricane Ivan. Sharon Levy investigates.  When Mary Glenn returned to Grenada this January, she was stunned to see her study site, once a rich forest with a tall canopy of centuries-old trees, reduced to splinters. Glenn, a primate researcher and anthropologist, has spent more than a decade in the West Indies studying the mona monkey ( Cercopithecus mona ) in Grenada's highlands. But she was at her home in California when the full force of Hurricane Ivan hit the island on 7 September last year, flattening the forest and leaving a maze of stumps and twisted logs. Even though she'd seen the disaster on the news, the reality of the destruction was shocking. The forest wasn't the only casualty. The hurricane tore through the island's towns, ripping off roofs and sucking glass clean out of windows. Many houses were reduced to their foundations, leaving the locals to camp out among the wreckage of their former homes. Although the islanders' situation has touched Glenn deeply, the plight of the monkeys is also close to her heart. The storm killed much of the forest that the monas depend on for food, and even those trees left standing were stripped bare of their leaves and fruit. Hungry monkeys have been driven into the open to loiter at the edges of towns, raiding kitchens in a desperate search for food. It's likely that the majority of the island's 6,000 or so monkeys died during the storm, says Glenn, and more could perish in its aftermath. As the islanders set about rebuilding their homes, can the monkey population also find the strength to recover? It's possible: the monas have a long history of survival. Grenada's monkeys are descended from a tiny population \u2014 perhaps a single pregnant female \u2014 brought from the West African island of S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 sometime in the eighteenth century by sailors on the slave trade route. As a result, today's mona population is highly inbred and displays practically no genetic diversity. When Glenn recruited a geneticist to analyse the monkeys' maternally inherited mitochondrial DNA, she kept checking and rechecking her work, fearing that she had accidentally rerun a sample from the same individual. \u201cThey are as alike as identical twins,\u201d says Glenn. Yet before the hurricane struck, the monas were in rude health \u2014 not necessarily what one might expect from a highly inbred population. Given that, Glenn is optimistic about their chances in the face of yet another genetic bottleneck. \u201cThe monas will bounce back,\u201d she says. \n               Single life \n             Periods of genetic isolation have played an important role in the evolutionary history of most cercopithecine monkeys, commonly known as guenons. At least 21 species and more than 60 subspecies of guenon have been identified in Africa, ranging from Sierra Leone in the west to the headwaters of the Nile in the east. The monkeys come in a wild array of brilliant face and body patterns, which evolved when ancestral populations were isolated in patches of forest during droughts long ago. Guenons attract the interest of evolutionary biologists in part thanks to the monkeys' ability to mate and produce viable offspring with other species of the genus. Cross-species guenon pairs with wildly different physical traits and even different numbers of chromosomes have been known to produce healthy young. Glenn, now a professor at Humboldt State University in Arcata, California, first came to Grenada as a graduate student in 1992 to study the guenons. The thriving population of genetically isolated monkeys seemed to be the perfect natural laboratory, particularly as many of the monas were relatively fearless and easy to observe. Before Ivan struck, Grenada was a mona paradise; the monkeys had few competitors for food, and their only predators were a small number of hunters who culled perhaps a few tens of animals each year.  Glenn spent the next three years roaming the forest of the Grand Etang Reserve, developing close relationships with the island's monkeys and people. At that time, almost nothing was known about the natural history of monas, so Glenn and her co-workers were able to document some previously unknown behaviour 1 , 2 . She noted, for example, that the monkeys have a unique copulation call \u2014 a distinctive, multisyllabic cry. Her work also revealed interesting social structures. Primatologists who had studied guenons in the past had found that they tended to live in clans made up of a dominant male, several females and their young. Adult males that lacked the clout to control a harem were thought to live solitary lives. But the most obvious groups of monas in the Grand Etang Reserve are all-male gangs that hang around the reserve's visitor centre, scamming tourists for donations of fruit. \u201cMonas are the only guenons that have documented, stable, very social, all-male groups,\u201d says Glenn. \u201cThey groom each other, sit in contact, engage in homosexual sex, even share food.\u201d \n               Monkey puzzle \n             But perhaps the biggest surprise for Glenn about Grenada's mona population was the fact that the island monkeys seemed to be healthier than their mainland counterparts. \u201cI expected to find problems and quirks in the population,\u201d she says; this often happens in inbred populations, as rare recessive genes pair up and are expressed. But she found none. \u201cI think it was just chance that a very healthy female came to Grenada, that she didn't have a lot of deleterious genes, and that the island had no environmental factors that happened to set off the genetic weaknesses of her descendants,\u201d says Glenn. The damaging effects of inbreeding are well documented in captive animals. There is a correlation between a decline in genetic diversity and an increase in malformed or stillborn offspring, and some studies suggest that the efficiency of the immune system also declines 3 . Statistically, inbreeding makes a population more vulnerable to a freak storm or new illness. But some species have done quite well with a minimal genetic repertoire. The Mauritius kestrel ( Falco punctatus ), for example, was decimated by the impact of pesticides and dwindled to a single breeding pair in 1974. Yet today there are at least 200 healthy pairs living in the wild. And, as scientists as early as Charles Darwin noted, tiny founding populations on islands can do amazingly well in the absence of disease and other challenges. Despite such examples, conservation biologists still often say that once a population declines below a certain level there is no point trying to rescue it, as it will be doomed by the effects of inbreeding. \u201cI heard repeatedly from other biologists when I was working on the California condor project that it was a total and monumental waste of time and money,\u201d says Keith Bensen, Glenn's husband and a wildlife biologist at Redwood National and State Parks in California. \u201cWell, it's not.\u201d California condors ( Gymnogyps californianus ) were decimated by hunting and habitat loss, but a captive breeding programme begun with a handful of survivors helped reintroduce them to the wild. \u201cSometimes the population will survive and thrive,\u201d Bensen says. But Glenn cautions that these success stories don't mean that all small populations will fare equally well. Many of mainland Africa's guenons have been driven into small \u2018islands\u2019 of habitat by heavy logging, but unlike Grenada's monas, these monkeys are also targeted by heavy hunting and are exposed to competition and disease from other primates. \u201cWe're not advocating the idea that it's OK to isolate monkey populations in west Africa,\u201d says Glenn. \u201cYou can't take them down to one or two animals and assume they can recover.\u201d Although a lack of genetic diversity doesn't always spell doom, these extra pressures can tip some species into extinction. \n               Climbing back \n             Back on Grenada, the monas that lived through the initial chaos of Hurricane Ivan are continuing their struggle for survival. The quest for food has forced them near to houses and roads, and several have been run over by cars. But people have reported seeing monkey mothers with their young \u2014 a promising sign of recovery. And a few palms are beginning to grow leaves and form new fruit. Officials on the island have also imposed a temporary ban on monkey hunting. Glenn, whose most recent trip to the island was focused on bringing material and financial aid to families and community organizations, hopes to return to Grenada soon to study the monas' responses to life after the disaster. The hurricane's long-term effects will make this a difficult task. Four months after the storm, the Grand Etang Reserve looks green once again. But instead of a 45-metre-tall canopy of old-growth forest, there is a landscape of stumps and shattered tree trunks, draped in vines. The rains have come to Grenada, and with most of the trees dead, the rugged terrain is collapsing. A growing number of landslides now darken the streams that are the island's source of drinking water, and dangerous terrain makes it nearly impossible to move through the forest. Park workers plan to begin replanting trees in the reserve to stop this decline. It will take years for the land and the monkeys to recover. And it will take several generations of monas \u2014 some 20 years or more \u2014 before Glenn can truly assess the effect this latest genetic bottleneck has had on the population. Like everyone else on the island, Glenn and the monas now need to start over. \n                     http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/422035a \n                   \n                     Wisconsin Regional Primate Research Center \n                   \n                     National Primate Research Centers \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Rex Dalton joins them.  In a limestone cave on Java, sheltered from the monsoon rain that patters on the jungle leaves outside, a neatly dug shaft drops into the floor. Descending a bamboo ladder, workers disappear into the shadows to reinforce the pit's wooden supports. The archaeologists are anxious to begin extracting earth and, they hope, bones of hominins \u2014 species from the same family as modern humans. But first they have to pull out a huge rock that blocks their progress some five metres down \u2014 probably part of the ceiling that collapsed maybe 50,000 years ago. Thomas Sutikna surveys the situation with his colleagues from the Indonesian Centre for Archaeology. Gazing into the shaft, team co-leader Michael Morwood of the University of New England, Australia, dreams of the treasures that may lie beneath. \u201cI think we have some very old material under this,\u201d he says. Last year, this same group of Indonesian and Australian archaeologists electrified the world with their report of the discovery of a miniature human species,  Homo floresiensis , which lived on the nearby island of Flores at least as recently as 18,000 years ago 1 . This new hominin, whose near-complete specimen was called LB1 and nicknamed \u2018hobbit\u2019 by some of the finders, represents a totally unexpected branch of the human evolutionary tree. The team is now hoping to unearth a similarly startling new find \u2014 the ancestors of  H. floresiensis . But a tense political backdrop may make the fieldwork difficult. At least one prominent Indonesian scientist publicly disputes the team's original description of the find; against prevailing opinion he says that the specimens do not represent a new species. And the discovery team claims that after he took the bones for study, they were returned in a damaged state that may hinder further analysis. All this is enough to make the team seek a place of solace. So it is perhaps fitting that the researchers are currently digging in a cave called Song Gupuh (pronounced song-ga-poo) \u2014 \u2018flee cave\u2019 in English. Here, in a cave where generations of people have sought refuge, the team is trying to put controversy aside to concentrate on the next chapter of its research. The goal is to identify a transitional species \u2014 the hominins who later evolved into the hobbit's clan. This should help anthropologists understand from whence  H. floresiensis  came, and perhaps how it acquired such a baffling mix of features: a metre-tall stature, ape-like arms and a small brain, but sufficient intelligence, seemingly, to make and use stone tools. The cave is promising: it is very habitable, with water nearby and a good view of incoming predators. And it holds a deep accumulation of sediments, which may extend back some 100,000 years. In some ways Song Gupuh is similar to Liang Bua, or \u2018cool cave\u2019 \u2014 the shelter where  H. floresiensis  was found nearly six metres under the floor. Both caves were partially excavated by an earlier generation of Indonesian researchers, before Morwood and his colleagues brought their teams to dig more extensively. \n               Crossing the line \n             But Song Gupuh is also markedly different. Java lies on the western side of a 350-metre-deep undersea canyon, which played a crucial role in humanity's trek out of Asia. During glacial periods, tens or hundreds of thousands of years ago, ice covered much of the upper globe; the ocean level was so low that early humans could walk to Indonesian islands such as Java on the exposed shelf (see map). But Flores, along with other eastern islands, was isolated by deep water. Early humans could only reach these islands using some form of watercraft. This isolation may help to explain why the features of  H. floresiensis  are so distinct. The species is thought to have grown small because of a lack of resources on the island. Fossils in the Liang Bua cave show that other animals were subjected to similar pressures: alongside the hominins, the remains of pygmy elephants were found. However, the watery trench \u2014 named the Wallace Line after Alfred Russel Wallace, a contemporary of Charles Darwin who first noted the marked differences between animals living either side of it \u2014 also poses a problem. No one knows how hominins in early periods crossed the open water. During a ferry ride across the choppy waters of the Wallace Line to Lombok, Morwood marvels at the feat. \u201cDo you think you could make it across here in a raft?\u201d he asks. It was this conundrum that first brought Morwood and his colleagues to the area. In 1996, Morwood's team reported stone tools at a site on Flores called Mata Menge. The site was dated to 900,000 years ago 2 , which is long before the period when anthropologists thought that sophisticated hominins lived there. Morwood established a collaboration with researchers from the Indonesian Centre in Jakarta, including Sutikna. By looking for fossils on both sides of the Wallace Line, Morwood and his colleagues hoped to learn who made it across the water, when they got across, and possibly even how. One good candidate was  Homo erectus , who is thought to have survived on Java until as recently as 25,000\u201350,000 years ago 3 . By 2001, Morwood and his Indonesian colleagues were returning to caves that had been explored in previous decades by Radien Soejono, the senior archaeologist at the Indonesian Centre. Now 78, Soejono has ceded fieldwork to younger Indonesian colleagues. But he remains a national political and scientific force, and he was made co-chief investigator of the team with Morwood.  During the summer dig season in 2003, the researchers hit the big time at Liang Bua when they uncovered the LB1 specimen. Their original question about who made the 900,000-year-old tools paled in comparison. Everyone on the team was ecstatic \u2014 but their work set in motion rivalries in Indonesia that continue today. Within days of the Liang Bua specimen's extraction, Soejono sought to have the bones transferred to the laboratory of his long-time colleague Teuku Jacob, a palaeoanthropologist at Gajah Mada University in the old Javanese capital of Yogyakarta. Initially trained as a physician, Jacob went on to get degrees in anthropology in the United States and Holland. By the 1970s, his lab was the prime Indonesian location for anthropological studies. Soejono and Jacob both lived through the Japanese occupation of the Second World War. Soejono is famous for surviving an attempt to tear down a Japanese flag in front of gun-toting soldiers. Later, when a student army helped to drive out the Dutch colonial regime in 1949, Jacob was the students' voice on the lone radio station. Both he and Soejono are national icons, with access to the presidential palace. But Jacob is also an extremely proud individual, sensitive to hints of colonialism. Over the years, Indonesia has drawn international researchers to examine its geological and anthropological riches. Some of these visiting researchers have caused difficulties, at times taking too much credit for their discoveries. Jacob finds such behaviour insulting and has reacted negatively. Such dynamics have prompted some leading anthropologists to steer completely clear of Indonesia. Somewhat scientifically isolated, the 75-year-old Jacob has continued to adhere to the theory that hominin species from multiple regions around the globe evolved into a single line that produced modern  H. sapiens . In this theory, Neanderthals were direct ancestors of modern humans, but most studies have shown that they were not related to  H. sapiens . The \u2018multi-regional\u2019 theory has virtually no support among the world's leading anthropologists. Instead, the prevailing view is that modern humans first evolved less than 200,000 years ago in eastern Africa, and spread across Europe, Asia and the available land bridges, becoming the dominant species. Reports of a human relative that existed 7 million years ago in Chad 4 , and a 160,000-year-old subspecies of  H. sapiens  in Ethiopia 5  have strengthened this \u2018out of Africa\u2019 hypothesis. The finding of  H. floresiensis  fails to support the multi-regional theory because there is no evidence that it contributed to the  H. sapiens  line. But Jacob and his allies remain unconvinced. Their beliefs may even have affected Morwood's fieldwork. Following the discovery of LB1, the Indonesian Centre archaeologists excitedly sought more bones to ensure that the specimen wasn't just an individual with unusual characteristics. But last August, Soejono tried to pull the young Indonesian researchers out of Liang Bua cave. He claimed he wanted the team to help prepare for a scientific conference, but team members were not convinced by this explanation, and found the interference unhelpful. In the end, Morwood's arguments to keep the researchers digging were successful, and the bones of a total of eight separate  H. floresiensis  individuals were unearthed. Buried at the same site was an unusual set of flaked stone tools 6 . \n               Hand overs \n             In November, just after the publication of  H. floresiensis ' description, Soejono independently signed agreements to hand the specimens over to Jacob, who wanted to examine them himself. \u201cWe thought we would never see them again,\u201d says Morwood. Peter Brown, the lead author on the paper announcing the discovery, \u201cworked furiously to take measurements and pictures before they were taken away\u201d, adds Morwood. Jacob held on to the specimens for two months longer than was originally agreed, saying he needed more time. After repeated requests, all but two leg bones were returned on 23 February 2005 (see   Nature 434 5; 2005 ). Soejono says he was confused by the situation, caught between the desires of his scientific peer and those of the younger scientists. \u201cMy students were angry,\u201d Soejono laments.  Jacob also shared access to published and unpublished material with other researchers, including Alan Thorne, a long-time professional antagonist of Brown and a semi-retired palaeoanthropologist from the Australian National University in Canberra. After their analysis, Jacob and Thorne publicly declared that  H. floresiensis  was not a new species. They believe the specimens are of a tribe of pygmies, one of which has the congenital disorder microcephaly \u2014 a disease that causes a smaller skull and brain. They hold to this position even after such a disorder was largely ruled out by imagery of the skull 7  published last month by US researchers who collaborated with the discovery team.  Putting such criticism behind them, the team this month turned its attention to the condition of some of the most important bones. The researchers believe that efforts to make casts at Jacob's lab, along with the trauma of transport, led to significant damage. Parts of the skull were pulled off, they say, and a jaw was broken between the front two teeth, splintering an area crucial for future analysis. \u201cThere was no reason to make casts of such fragile bones,\u201d says Brown, noting that computerized X-ray images are just as useful. There was even an attempt to force pieces back together with glue, he says, and the pelvis of LB1 was crushed. \u201cThis callous treatment of hominin material of world importance is just sickening,\u201d says Morwood. Jacob declined a telephone interview with  Nature , although he has denied damaging the fossils to others. \n               Remains of the day \n              While the damage is assessed and further work is done on the bones, Morwood and his team are trying hard to look forwards to future discoveries. So far, they are no closer to answering their original questions about who crossed the Wallace Line and when. Their excavations have shown that  H. floresiensis  was on Flores as early as 90,000 years ago 6 , and researchers have shown that other hominins were around at the same time. While  H. floresiensis  thrived,  H. sapiens  was living on nearby Borneo and  H. erectus  could be found in Java. But a clearer picture of the relationship between these different species is still elusive. Analysing DNA from the bones can help to determine a species' lineage. But first one has to find non-degraded genetic material, which the discovery team has not yet been able to do. A team at the Max Plank Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany, is also looking for DNA, in a piece of rib supplied to them by Jacob. The experiments are currently under way. In the meantime, Morwood and his team will spend the coming season digging in locations dictated by the monsoons. In February they began at Song Gupuh, which will stay dry no matter how hard it rains; they will move on as the monsoon recedes. If Morwood's team finds more bones of  H. floresiensis  at Liang Bua, they will strengthen the published case. Multiple skulls with the distinctive small size will quieten even their most outspoken critics. But how many would they need to find? When asked face-to-face, Jacob hesitates for a moment, before saying: \u201cTwo or three? No. But if there were more, I might reconsider.\u201d He's on safe ground \u2014 finding such a trove of ancient skulls is basically unheard of.  Even finding good caves in which to look is proving tricky. After taking the ferry to Lombok, Morwood and fellow Australian Douglas Hobbs set off to follow a tip from an archaeologist friend. They found the cave he had spotted while on a surf trip. Saumg Batu, as it is called, is ideal for human habitation: spacious, dry and accessible. Inside, there is a rock used by some ancient folk for grinding seeds, and nearby rests a spear point. But the cave isn't suitable for a major dig. \u201cThe sediment doesn't look deep enough,\u201d proclaims Morwood.  In the months ahead, the team knows there may be more serious obstacles to its work than bad luck. The researchers must tread softly when challenging the greybeards of Indonesian science; no one wants to stir political animosity that might block exploration permits. So far, the Australian team members have the backing of Tony Djubiantono, director of the Indonesian Centre for Archaeology, which issues permits. And the young Indonesian researchers are enthusiastic about their partnership with the Australians, grateful for the funds, training, patience and goodwill brought to the project. But these young Indonesians, eager to lead the team to the forefront internationally, must contend with their scientific elders. \u201cIt is not the Indonesian way\u201d for the young to lead, Soejono has told them. Those researchers who know the potential for Indonesian anthropology hope that the way is changing. \n                     http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/4311029a \n                   \n                     http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/434005a \n                   \n                     Flores Man special \n                   \n                     Michael Morwood \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Erika Check reports.  This January, Harvard University president Larry Summers incited a near riot by suggesting that men might be better than women at science. The resulting pandemonium has revealed few genuine insights into male and female mental abilities \u2014 although it has shown that old prejudices linger on campus, and beyond. In contrast, biology presents a challenge to those who still believe women are better off at home than in the hallowed halls of universities. As geneticists search for the roots of humanity's unique mental abilities, they are beginning to pay close attention to the \u2018feminine\u2019 X chromosome. Women have two copies of this chromosome, whereas men have only one. And the complete sequence of the X chromosome, published in  Nature  this week 1  (see also News and Views,  page 279 ), confirms that an unusually large number of its genes code for proteins important to brain function. Why this should be the case is sparking debate among evolutionary biologists. And some are even suggesting that the X chromosome will tell us why we are different from our closest relatives \u2014 why we can write poetry and design nuclear weapons, but chimpanzees can't. In a sense, they argue, the feminine chromosome could hold the secrets of humanity. \u201cWe used to think that the X was boring,\u201d says Jenny Graves, an evolutionary geneticist at the Australian National University in Canberra. \u201cNow we're seeing just how wrong we were.\u201d Today's understanding of the X chromosome helps to explain a puzzling observation from the late nineteenth century, when doctors combing through data from the 1890 US Census noticed that more boys than girls were mentally disabled 2 . We now know that this reflects a preponderance of genes for brain function on the X chromosome. A woman uses only one of her two X chromosomes in each cell, so if one of her X chromosomes has a defective gene, only some of her cells will suffer. But men have only one X, so any defective brain genes from that chromosome are invariably expressed. \n               All in the mind \n             Many different types of mental retardation have since been linked to defects in genes on the X chromosome \u2014 far more than can be explained by their chance distribution throughout the genome. According to one analysis, there are 221 known human genetic defects that can cause mental impairment, some 10% of which reside on the X chromosome, even though it carries less than 4% of known human genes 3 . Detailed studies have also shown that the specific genes linked to mental disabilities play crucial roles in normal brain function 4 . For instance, more than a decade ago, an international team reported the discovery of the gene that causes fragile X syndrome 5 , a disorder that leads to a range of problems including mental disability. Scientists now know that the defective gene, called  FMR1 , normally makes a protein that is involved in shuttling the genetic messages that enable nerve cells to send signals through the brain 6 . Another gene, known as  MECP2 , leads to a whole range of mental disorders when mutated; its protein seems to be involved in the silencing of other genes required for normal learning, memory and the growth of brain cells 4 .  It's still a giant step from understanding defects in single genes to proving that the X chromosome allows us to write novels and solve calculus equations. But there is some indirect evidence that genes on the X chromosomes are involved in higher cognitive functions. One hint comes from a study of 4,000 sets of British identical twins. Each female twin inherits two X chromosomes, one from her mother and one from her father, but each individual twin randomly inactivates one of her two X chromosomes. So identical twin sisters can express different X-chromosome genes. In contrast, male identical twins inherit only one X chromosome, from their mothers, and so must activate the same X-linked genes. In the British study, researchers led by Ian Craig of King's College London found that in some traits linked to intelligence, such as verbal skills and good social behaviour, male twins were more alike than female twins 7 . But why should the X chromosome have emerged as a hotspot for genes influencing our cognitive abilities? Evolutionary geneticists believe that the two mammalian sex chromosomes, X and Y, were once identical. As mammals began to diverge from their reptilian ancestors, some 300 million years ago, the proto-X and proto-Y chromosomes took on the role of determining an individual's sex. Both initially started accumulating genes from elsewhere in the genome, but over time the two chromosomes began to grow apart; the Y started to shrink and lost many of its genes. \n               Solid foundation \n              Eventually, the sex chromosomes diverged to the point where they were no longer able to exchange genetic material during the cell divisions that give rise to sperm and eggs, as do the members of every other pair of chromosomes. This has left the X chromosome as one of the most stable in the mammalian genome \u2014 which paradoxically may have exposed its genes to more intense pressure to evolve. The X chromosome gets a chance to shine, or to fail miserably, each time it passes through the male line. Because a male carries only one copy, any new mutations are revealed in all their glory. And because successful males have the potential to sire very large numbers of children with multiple partners, mutations on the X chromosome that are advantageous to both sexes can spread rapidly through a population. In our own species, where intelligence and social skills are thought to be central to success, genes on the X chromosome seem to have evolved rapidly to provide us with the necessary brain power. \u201cIf higher cognitive abilities were a critical step in our own evolution, it makes sense that you might find those functions on the X chromosome,\u201d says Hunt Willard, a human geneticist and director of the Institute for Genome Sciences and Policy at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina. Provocatively, researchers led by Horst Hameister at the University of Ulm in Germany speculate that this process was driven by sexual selection 3 . Early in human evolution, they suggest, females developed a preference for intelligent males. According to their theory, the genes for super-intelligence and for the preference of intelligent males were closely linked, and so were inherited together. And because superior intelligence also aided survival, the process wasn't kept in check by natural selection \u2014 unlike other sexually selected characteristics such as the peacock's tail, which makes its bearers more vulnerable to predators. Many of the genes on the X chromosome associated with human brain function seem to have distant relatives with different functions in other vertebrates, such as chickens and fish 8 . So in boosting our cognitive abilities, the X chromosome seems to have co-opted a diverse range of existing genes, rather than evolving a new set of genetic sequences for the purpose. \u201cThese old genes are getting new use,\u201d says Hameister. In some instances, geneticists have pinpointed genes on the X chromosome that still seem to be in the process of adopting new roles in the brain. For instance, a gene called  JARID1C  seems to be evolving from a similar gene called  JARID1D , which is found on the Y chromosome. If men inherit a damaged version of the  JARID1C  gene on their single X chromosome, they develop mental disabilities. The fact that the healthy Y chromosome version cannot compensate for its defective cousin hints that  JARID1C  is becoming more crucial to the brain as it evolves 9 . \n               Personality profiles \n              Geneticists are now gearing up to go after other X-linked genes that may help explain what makes us human. In London, Craig's team plans to identify twins who score high or low on certain \u2018people skills\u2019, such as sharing their toys and volunteering help to others. The researchers will then use gene chips to scan the twins' DNA, looking for particular genetic variations that correlate with these traits. Once they find a region of DNA that seems to link to a particular trait, the group will look at the detailed sequence of individual chromosomes to try to pin down the exact gene involved. The X chromosome data, with its wealth of information about human brain genes, is likely to feature prominently in this endeavour. Other researchers plan to continue the quest for genes involved in X-linked brain disorders. Every two years, for instance, scientists meet as part of a European consortium that catalogues genes involved in such conditions. Researchers believe that the information so far gleaned about human brain function from these studies barely scratches the surface. If we want to understand the cognitive \u2018X factor\u2019 that separates us from the rest of the animal kingdom, then it seems that the X chromosome is the place to start looking. In the meantime, Summers and his acolytes can chew on this thought: even if there's any truth in the idea that men are more suited to a career in science than women, they just might owe this mental predisposition to the \u2018girly\u2019 chromosome. \n                     http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/news010726-4 \n                   \n                     http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/427390a \n                   \n                     http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/news040126-8 \n                   \n                     Nature genome gateway \n                   \n                     The Sanger Institute: Human X Chromosome Project Overview \n                   \n                     X-linked Mental Retardation Genes update website \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Ten years on and its chilly revelations are attracting a growing number of physicists. Karen Fox joins the party.  Birthday parties don't get much cooler than this \u2014 a mountain-top get-together for researchers fascinated by ultracold matter. Last month, to mark the tenth anniversary of the creation of the first Bose\u2013Einstein condensate, physicists met in Banff, Canada, to discuss ultracold atoms in the morning and ski in the afternoon. The air outside was cold and crisp, but inside the atmosphere was invitingly warm. The scene verged on the cosy. A Nobel prizewinner could be found sitting next to a gaggle of graduate students, and speakers were interrupted by good-natured questions. Indeed, Kathy Levin, a theorist from the University of Chicago, began her talk by saying: \u201cThere is a wonderful  esprit de corps  and camaraderie here \u2014 which one doesn't see in all fields, and which I think is a secret of its success.\u201d Levin recently escaped from the notoriously combative field of high-temperature superconductivity, another branch of condensed-matter physics. But her transition is not unique. In the past two years, with research into high-temperature superconductors stalled, more and more condensed-matter physicists have begun studying cold atoms. One is Fei Zhou of the University of British Columbia, who chaired a session in Banff and says he has never looked back since making the switch 18 months ago. Until then, Zhou says that every year he'd find fewer colleagues at the condensed-matter symposia he attended. By contrast, the field of ultracold atoms has swelled to some 100 labs and counting. There is excitement, funding and, most importantly, the chance to do some fascinating new science. The concept behind Bose\u2013Einstein condensation is much older than this youthful exuberance would suggest. In 1924, Albert Einstein and Satyendra Nath Bose used quantum mechanics to describe what would happen to a cloud of gas atoms if they were made so cold they essentially stopped moving. Squeeze them and they would merge into a single entity, a giant superatom. Locked together, moving as one, this condensate of atoms would become a new phase of matter \u2014 different from solid, liquid or gas. This idea remained no more than a thought experiment until 1938, when helium-4 was cooled to below 2.2 K and became a new kind of fluid that flows without friction \u2014 a \u2018superfluid\u2019. But supercooled helium is a liquid rather than a gas, and so is not considered a \u2018true\u2019 Bose\u2013Einstein condensate (BEC). Back then, creating the much colder temperatures necessary to make a gaseous condensate seemed impossible. Then, in 1995, two groups did it almost simultaneously. Eric Cornell of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and Carl Wieman of the University of Colorado in Boulder cooled 2,000 rubidium atoms into one entity; and Wolfgang Ketterle, a physicist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, made a condensate from half-a-million sodium atoms. These feats were recognized with a physics Nobel prize in 2001, but no one had foreseen just how much they would inspire a new generation of physicists. \u201cThe past ten years have just been an explosion,\u201d says Ketterle, who was unable to make it to Banff. \u201cThere have been so many surprises. When we discovered the BEC we had a short list of what we thought would be important. What has been done by far exceeds our expectations \u2014 in even my boldest dreams I could not think of so many interesting studies.\u201d  Ketterle's surprise is understandable. Early research focused on making BECs \u2014 always a painstaking exercise \u2014 from yet more, and different, atoms. Creation was an end in itself. But over the past five years, BEC physics has grown, not just in size but in ambition. Today, although some researchers continue to characterize BECs, others attempt to apply BEC physics to other fields, and yet others are exploring the relatively new area of condensates made from a class of fundamental particle known as fermions. An early question was whether BECs, like helium, are superfluids. In theory, once a superfluid starts swirling it should continue forever. Cornell and Wieman 1  first created such everlasting vortices in 1999, and today most people accept that BECs are superfluids. At Harvard University, physicist Lene Hau 2  recently formed both vortices and \u2018straight density waves\u2019, which are akin to a sound wave, in the same BEC. She watched them collide and blossom into something like a spinning umbrella in the process of turning inside-out. Such exquisite experiments demonstrate the control researchers now have over BECs. They have learned how to fine-tune the attraction between atoms in a BEC to do anything from spacing them in ordered lattices to forcing an entire BEC into something like a mini supernova. \u201cI'm just amazed,\u201d says Ketterle, \u201cthat an experiment I thought was bloody difficult when I did it ten years ago is now being done regularly, with sophistication and much more experimental control.\u201d And although theorists have had ten years to catch up, experiments are still driving the field. The moment a new theory comes out, there is someone in the wings ready to test it. \u201cThe experimentalists are wonderful,\u201d says Gordon Baym of the University of Illinois in Urbana\u2013Champaign. \u201cNot only do they do great experiments, but they do them once a week.\u201d It is this speed that helps make the field such a welcoming place. There is a sense that there is room for everyone.  Some of the fastest-moving research in cold atoms involves fermions. At a fundamental level, all matter comes in two varieties: fermions, such as protons, and bosons, such as photons. Creating condensates out of fermions instead of bosons was a highlight of the past two years. A star of fermion physics, Deborah Jin, a physicist with NIST in Boulder, discussed her latest work at the Banff meeting. As she describes it, one of the main differences between fermionic and bosonic matter is that two bosons can exist in the same place, like two crossing beams of light, whereas fermions cannot. This difference should rule out a fermion condensate. But fermions can also behave strangely at low temperatures. When certain solids are cooled sufficiently, their conducting electrons \u2014 which are fermions \u2014 can pair up to create a boson, a phenomenon at the heart of our understanding of superconductivity. According to the 1957 Bardeen\u2013Cooper\u2013Schrieffer (BCS) theory, when two electrons merge to form a \u2018Cooper pair\u2019, this new boson can then effortlessly speed through the superconductor without resistance. Early last year, Jin's lab reported a breakthrough \u2014 they had created bosons out of fermions and then turned them into a condensate 3 . From the start there were hopes that studying fermion condensates would give insight into BCS theory. This theory explains superconductivity only at very cold temperatures \u2014 high-temperature systems discovered in the 1980s spawned numerous theories and rancorous debate, but no firm explanations. It is perhaps this, more than anything, that has attracted so many condensed-matter physicists to the BEC field. As Randy Hulet, a physicist at Rice University in Houston, Texas, says: \u201cWe can use BECs to model condensed-matter systems so cleanly, in ways you just can't do in real condensed-matter systems.\u201d Jin now hopes to \u2018see\u2019 a Cooper pair in a BEC \u2014 something researchers can only do indirectly in a superconductor. So far, the enigmatic dance partners remain hidden, but she can see correlations in the fermions' positions that hint at Cooper pairs. Although this work isn't conclusive, it offers hope that studying the links between BEC and BCS behaviour will deliver new insight. \u201cBCS theory is just very robust within condensed matter,\u201d says Levin. \u201cIt is the theory of all theories \u2014 if it turns out to be part of an even bigger theory, which I believe it is, then that's very exciting for us.\u201d Hulet, a veteran of cold-atom research, is also interested in how BECs can influence other fields. He was one of the first to create a BEC soliton, essentially a wave that never dissipates. These intense waves might one day be used to make inertial sensors for detecting changes in gravity or acceleration. Today's inertial sensing relies on optical instruments and Hulet believes that cold atoms could increase their accuracy. But he admits, \u201cSo far the solitons we can produce are too small.\u201d The greater reliability of atomic systems compared with optical ones has even got the military interested. Major Jay Lowell at the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), which funds cold-atom research, says he would like to see inertial navigation systems based on BECs within five to ten years. DARPA's plans involve atom interferometer technology, pioneered by Ketterle's lab among others. An atom interferometer requires two coherent atom waves (essentially two atom lasers), which can then be made to overlap and produce an interference pattern. DARPA is also tracking the potential of BECs in quantum computing \u2014 although Lowell's hopes for that are more in the 10\u201350 year range. Ignacio Cirac of the Max Planck Institute of Quantum Optics in Garching, Germany, gave a fascinating talk in Banff on how one might get BECs to behave as qubits \u2014 the basic building block of a quantum computer. For the moment, however, the idea remains firmly in the realms of theory. Predicting which directions will bear more fruit \u2014 fermions, solitons or something unknown \u2014 is not easy, but a field that even insiders consider esoteric continues to generate excitement. Young physicists who were at graduate school when the first BECs were made are now claiming the field as their own, and many older scientists are switching to what they hope are greener pastures. Ten years on, there's no slowing down. \u201cI thank my lucky stars,\u201d says Hulet, \u201cthat I stumbled on to this intellectual gold mine.\u201d \n                     2005: Year of physics special \n                   \n                     Jin Group \n                   \n                     Wolfgang Ketterle at MIT \n                   \n                     2005 Banff Cold Atom Meeting \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Alison Abbott joined a group of convicted murderers to learn about gravity. There is, it must be said, a certain irony in talking to the incarcerated about the stars and the infinity of space. And a particular poignancy in telling them about black holes \u2014 from which nothing can escape. Yet 50 or so prisoners, many of them lifers, at the maximum-security Muret Prison near Toulouse, France, listened with rapt attention to astrophysicist Didier Barret's 90-minute lecture on Einstein's theories of matter, space and time. If Barret, who works at the Laboratory of Space Astrophysics (CESR) in Toulouse, was aware of these sensitivities, he did not show it. He marched slickly but relentlessly through the theory, to observations of the birth and collapse of stars, and on to his own front-line research on the celestial explosions known as \u03b3-ray bursts. The prisoners didn't flinch \u2014 although occasionally one would walk out, this also being the day for family visits. This was the last in a series of lectures at Muret \u2014 France's \u2018four-star prison\u2019, where inmates have their own rooms, and the warders encourage educational events. Barret, who organized the talks, believes in taking public outreach one step beyond the conventional. \u201cThere are some groups of people who physically can't come to a public lecture at the local science centre or wherever \u2014 so we take our public lectures to them,\u201d he says. To pursue this philosophy Barret established an association called  Les \u00c9toiles Brillent pour Tous  (\u2018The stars shine for everyone\u2019) in May last year \u2014 with the Muret lectures as one of its first ventures. The experience at Muret turned out to be less alarming than the lecturers had anticipated. Barret is a burly amateur soccer player, but confesses to being a little nervous when he first made his way through the seven security gates that divide each ring of the prison complex to reach the highest-security core. Here is located a round concrete church, where the lectures were to take place a few weeks later. Muret is a prison for serious sexual crimes and murder. It is not an easy place for intellectual curiosity to take root. On his first visit, Barret remembers finding the stage of the church a mess of broken furniture, cigarette ends and other rubbish. \u201cI told the prisoners who were showing me around that it would not be possible to give a serious lecture in such surroundings,\u201d he says. They promised that they would clear it up in time for the first lecture \u2014 on astronomical dimensions \u2014 in June. And they kept their word. The stage was immaculate, and there was even a bottle of water, with a glass, for the speaker, Peter von Ballmoos, one of Barret's CESR colleagues. \n               Star pupils \n             Von Ballmoos had been warned by warders that prisoners often shout or jeer at guest speakers. \u201cI had thought I would feel frightened and vulnerable on stage,\u201d he recalls. But instead he found them courteous and well-behaved, apparently won round by the seriousness of the subject. The other four speakers in the series had similar experiences. Even the two female lecturers found themselves at ease despite the presence, within arm's reach, of an audience convicted of heinous crimes. Discussions after the lectures, they said, were much like those after any \u2018normal\u2019 public lecture, although they tended to drift towards philosophical aspects of cosmology, such as the unimaginable scale of the Universe. Perhaps cosmology helps the prisoners gain a fresh perspective on their incarceration, muses von Ballmoos. \u201cOn such an immense scale the prisoners have essentially the same level of freedom as a non-prisoner,\u201d he says. And whatever the topic of the lecture, the prisoners were always keen to discuss extreme events, such as the Big Bang and black holes \u2014 violent cosmological phenomena in which matter gets crushed to infinite density under the pull of infinite gravity, and the laws of physics break down. There were occasionally aggressive interjections that would not be expected in other public forums \u2014 for example, when one prisoner was irritated by a question from another and stormed out, yelling offensively; or when a technical problem with the microphone precipitated ill-tempered (and nerve-racking) heckling. But the regular attendees tended to be well-behaved and deeply engaged. Talking after Barret's lecture, one prisoner, a former trade-union employee who had already served seven years, explained how physics became an immediate passion when he heard about CERN, the European particle-physics laboratory in Geneva, through his job. The prison lectures are magnificent, he says, and help him continue his self-education. A bit of a Renaissance man, he spends some of his prison time writing poetry, and the cosmos provides him with a rich source of metaphors. Not all of the prisoners share this romantic outlook, but the lectures have been deemed such a success that the prison authorities are keen for a second series this year. And another prison in the area, the Maison d'Arr\u00eade Seysses, has persuaded Barret to arrange a lecture series for it as well. Les \u00c9toiles Brillent pour Tous  is there for the innocent as well as the guilty.

Quirin Schiermeier tags along for the ride. The journey southwest from Berlin to Golm, a small village near Potsdam, is a 90-minute train trip to the end of the world. Or that is how it seemed on a misty December morning. Outside Potsdam the only view from the window is farmland stretching to the horizon, until an ultra-modern glass building looms out of the fog. This think-tank in the middle of nowhere is the Max Planck Institute for Gravitational Physics, often called the Albert Einstein Institute. As might be expected, it is home to theorists who are struggling with physics' deepest questions. How did the Universe begin? What will be its fate? And what happens to time, space and matter at these extremes? The forlorn landscape outside rather suits Martin Bojowald, a 31-year-old German theorist, who admits he spends most of his time staring into space. Except when writing papers or e-mails, he hardly uses a computer \u2014 and he does most of his deep thinking at home, where he feels less self-conscious about his apparent lack of activity. Bojowald is a disciple of loop quantum gravity, a theory of gravity at the smallest of scales, which physicists can use to look inside black holes or back to the first few moments of the Universe. Loop quantum gravity is a way to reconcile general relativity \u2014 Einstein's theory of how gravity shapes the cosmos \u2014 with our quantum picture of the atomic world. Gravity, alone among the four fundamental forces of nature, seems not to respect the rules of quantum physics. Loop quantum gravity tries to address this directly, by rewriting Einstein's equations within a quantum framework. A popular alternative route to \u2018quantum gravity\u2019 is provided by string theory, which has its roots in particle physics, and postulates that everything in the Universe is made of unobservable vibrating strings. Any decent theory that claims to unite general relativity with quantum theory should be able to fix some of the cosmological puzzles unsolved by general relativity. One enduring mystery is figuring out what happened during the Big Bang \u2014 the cosmic event that about 15 billion years ago gave birth to a hot, dense fireball and eventually, stars, galaxies and humans. Although Einstein's equations can describe much of the Universe's history, they break down the closer we get to this moment of creation. \n               Off with a bang \n             Conventional wisdom says that the Big Bang was the start of everything, including time, so questions about the Big Bang itself, or what came before, don't make sense. Or so we're told. But the breakdown in the laws of physics \u2014 the singularity problem \u2014 limits what we know about the starting conditions of the Universe. So it leads to arbitrary assumptions, such as an early period of rapid expansion (inflation), to get the Universe to where it is now. It is in part thanks to Bojowald that a cosmology based on loop quantum gravity has become a respected, albeit controversial, notion. \u201cMartin has opened the door to the possibility of calculating the predictions of loop theory for cosmology, and determining whether they can be tested against observations,\u201d says Roy Maartens, a cosmologist at the University of Portsmouth, UK. In the loop quantum universe everything is quantized, or discrete, including time. Space can be chopped up into discrete \u2018cubes\u2019, just 10 \u221299  cm 3 . One cube would equal the smallest unit of space, but it is not \u2018empty\u2019 space; each cube incorporates space, time and matter in the form of intersecting \u2018loops\u2019. \u201cThis has few consequences for our understanding of the real world,\u201d says Bojowald. These loops operate on scales far outside our experience. \u201cBut the discreteness of loop theory makes it much easier mathematically and conceptually to come to terms with the early Universe,\u201d he says. \n               In the loop \n             Although the loop language is complex, the maths behind the theory is elegant. Bojowald has created a framework in which physical laws do not break down at the Big Bang singularity (M. Bojowald  Phys. Rev. Lett.   86,  5227\u20135230; 2001). His results suggest that at extremely small scales, quantum gravitation can be repulsive, which prevents the collapse of space-time into a singularity. This effect, which would contradict general relativity, might be a consequence of the quantization of Einstein's equations, Bojowald says. Freed from the singularity, Bojowald can now look back to a time \u2018before\u2019 the Big Bang. He finds an inverted universe on the other side \u2014 a mirror-image of ours \u2014 expanding outwards as time runs backwards. Bojowald's model also provides tantalizing insight into how inflation occurs (M. Bojowald  Phys. Rev. Lett.   89,  261301; 2002). A gravitational repulsion not only prevents the collapse of a contracting universe, he believes, but also pulls apart an expanding one. Maartens cautions that this idea has some way to go before it is fully convincing. But that long road doesn't intimidate Bojowald, who is a long-distance runner both in real life and in science. \u201cIn the beginning, there was a lot of criticism,\u201d Bojowald says. \u201cBut things have changed, and meanwhile many cosmologists have got very interested in loop equations.\u201d Bojowald hopes that data from the European Space Agency's 2007 Planck mission will provide indirect backing for his ideas. This satellite will test theories of the early Universe by looking at the radiation left over from the Big Bang. After 2011, data from NASA's Laser Interferometer Space Antenna could reveal a quantum gravity effect from the early Universe in its observations of ripples in space-time. In the meantime, says Sean Carroll, a theoretical cosmologist at the University of Chicago, Illinois, string theory remains the more popular theory, given that it has solved many problems related to quantum gravity. \u201cBut,\u201d he adds, \u201cany alternative concept is welcome and needs to be taken seriously.\u201d \n                     Quantum gravity: The quantum of area? \n                   \n                     Cosmology: Beyond the inflationary border \n                   \n                     Quantum theory's last challenge \n                   \n                     www.aei.mpg.de \n                   \n                     dialog on quantum gravity, by Carlo \n                   \n                     www.edge.org/3rd_culture/smolin03/smolin03_index.html \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Geoff Brumfiel meets Senthil Todadri, a man who wants to change our view of how electrons behave.  Right from the start, it was clear that Senthil Todadri was no ordinary graduate student, says Subir Sachdev, a professor of physics and Senthil's adviser at Yale University. On his first day, Senthil made several observations that forced Sachdev to rethink his work. \u201cHe himself didn't understand the depth to which he understood things,\u201d Sachdev says. That first day's work was enough to win Senthil co-authorship on the group's next paper. Senthil (who grew up with no last name, but adopted his father's name, Todadri, when he came to the United States) is the son of a banker in the Indian city of Chennai. \u201cI was going to work in a bank just like my father, but got more and more sucked into maths and science,\u201d he says. \u201cMy family considered it a bit bizarre when I decided to take up physics.\u201d After completing his undergraduate degree at the Indian Institute of Technology in Kanpur, he began his graduate studies at Yale in 1992. Since his first day on the job, Senthil, now 34, has continued to make waves in condensed-matter physics, a field whose theoretical underpinnings are in upheaval. Since the early 1980s, experimentalists have uncovered dozens of materials that defy the present theory of how electrons behave in solids \u2014 often referred to as the Fermi liquid model. Senthil is helping to build a new theoretical framework that could explain these exotic materials, the most alluring of which are superconductors (they have no electrical resistance) at temperatures that exceed those predicted by current models. \n               Deep divisions \n             One of the more unconventional ideas Senthil has pursued is that an electron added to a material can \u2018split\u2019 under the right circumstances, so that a fraction of its charge goes one way, and a bit of its \u2018spin\u2019 the other. \u201cIt's a pretty dramatic thing if you think about it because an electron is supposed to be a fundamental particle,\u201d Senthil says. The electron loses its identity in the collective behaviour of other electrons in the solid, he explains. As the electron's fundamental characteristics of charge and spin are shared among the other electrons, it essentially splits into fractional particles of spin and charge. The idea of electron splitting has been around since the 1980s, but in the context of high-temperature superconductors it has been taken seriously only in the past five years or so \u2014 thanks in part to work by Senthil and his colleague Matthew Fisher of the University of California, Santa Barbara. In 2001, Senthil and Fisher proposed a novel way that their ideas could be tested against the behaviour of certain high-temperature superconductors 1 . Not long after, an experimental group at Stanford set out to search for the fractional charges 2 . Unfortunately, the team failed to find the exotic behaviour predicted by Senthil and Fisher, says Piers Coleman, a theoretical physicist at Rutgers University in New Jersey. \u201cIt was a nice idea that didn't work out, but that's okay,\u201d says Coleman. \u201cGood science has interesting proposals that can be tested. I think everyone regarded the work they did as extremely interesting and very stimulating.\u201d Sachdev, who has been a co-author on Senthil's work, agrees. \u201cSince his paper appeared a few years ago, we've found that those ideas have turned out to be remarkably powerful.\u201d Although the version of the theory proposed by Senthil and Fisher was proved wrong for high-temperature superconductors, they continue to explore ways in which the collective properties of a solid's electrons can shape its behaviour. Most recently, Senthil and his collaborators have made impressive progress in describing quantum phase transitions \u2014 sudden shifts in a material's behaviour that are caused by the quantum fluctuations of its electrons at a temperature of absolute zero 3 . Once again, this theory depends on fractional parts of electrons appearing briefly at the point where the material changes from one state to another. \n               Homeward bound \n             This January, Senthil will leave his position at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and return to India, where he will lead a theoretical group at the Indian Institute of Science in Bangalore. The reasons for the move are personal and professional, he says. It will allow him, his wife and his young daughter to be closer to the rest of their family.  \u201cI don't know what it is really going to be like,\u201d he says. But the quality of Indian physics has been steadily improving over the past few decades, he adds. One outstanding question is whether Senthil will be able to recruit the high-quality graduate students that form the backbone of any good theory group. \u201cI'm hoping it will be possible to get good students and postdocs in India, but I don't have firsthand experience,\u201d he says. Despite some setbacks and uncertainties, Senthil remains confident that within a decade an entirely new set of theories will be developed that can explain even the most bizarre of materials. \u201cWe're just starting to glimpse an entirely new world inside solids,\u201d he says. \u201cIt's a great time for condensed-matter physics because a lot of the stuff we teach in textbooks needs to be revisited.\u201d \n                     A limit on spin-charge separation in high-Tc superconductors from the absence of a vortex-memory effect \n                   \n                     Senthil's website at MIT \n                   \n                     Summary of Senthil's work \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Geoff Brumfiel finds out how. Ask most theorists when they think their calculations will be tested experimentally and you'll be told \u201cdecades\u201d or sometimes, more honestly, \u201cnever\u201d. But ask Nima Arkani-Hamed, a physicist at Harvard University, and he will give you a far closer date: 2008. That is when the first results from the Large Hadron Collider, the world's most powerful particle accelerator, are expected to be released by CERN, the European particle-physics laboratory near Geneva, Switzerland. And if Arkani-Hamed's predictions are correct, then that is when an experiment will detect the first evidence to support string theory \u2014 a vision of the cosmos that has never been verified experimentally. \u201cThe field is going to turn on what happens at the collider,\u201d he says. Pacing his sparse Harvard office, the 32-year-old physicist drinks no less than six cups of espresso during our hour-and-a-half interview, as he tries to explain why he thinks string theory can now be tested. String theory emerged in the 1980s as a way to answer questions that still baffle modern physics, such as why is gravity so much weaker than other fundamental forces? By imagining that everything is composed entirely of strings ten billion billion times smaller than atomic nuclei, theoretical physicists were able to create a model of the Universe that unified all fundamental forces into one, and described most of the particles we see today. Unfortunately, these strings are far too small to be detected by even the most powerful particle accelerators. And so, critics say, they are more philosophy than physics. Arkani-Hamed's ideas have very little to do with strings themselves. Instead, he is hoping to detect the extra dimensions predicted by the theory, which, like the strings, are thought to be vanishingly small. But in 1998, Arkani-Hamed and his colleagues published calculations showing that some of these extra dimensions might be as large as a millimetre (N. Arkani-Hamed, S. Dimopoulos and G. Dvali  Phys. Lett. B   429,  263\u2013272; 1998). Such large dimensions, they argued, have escaped detection because everything we know \u2014 except for gravity \u2014 is confined to the three dimensions of space and one of time. But gravity, they think, might be able to seep into these extra dimensions. This would explain why it seems so weak to us. And, as a result, unexpected variations in gravity could allow researchers to detect the hidden dimensions. \n               Leaking away \n             \u201cIt was a watershed event in the field,\u201d recalls Joe Lykken, a theoretical physicist at Fermilab near Chicago in Illinois. Suddenly, a theory that most thought could never be tested was within experimental reach. Some groups rushed to look for deviations in gravity at small scales. So far, they have nothing to report, but the hope created by Arkani-Hamed's work is enough to win him wide praise. \u201cThe word \u2018genius\u2019 is overused, but I think it is easily applicable in the case of Nima,\u201d says Savas Dimopoulos, a Stanford theorist and one of Arkani-Hamed's collaborators. The son of two Iranian physicists, Arkani-Hamed was born in Houston, Texas, and grew up in Boston. After the Iranian revolution of 1979, his family returned to their homeland, but as religious fundamentalists took over the government, his father was forced to go underground and the family eventually had to flee across the border to Turkey. By 1982, Nima was living in Toronto, Canada. Recalling his early life, Arkani-Hamed says that his time in Iran was largely a positive experience. \u201cThe strange thing is that I have mostly wonderful memories,\u201d he says. If anything, he adds, it taught him to worry less about what others thought of him. \u201cGiven that so many aspects of my life have been unusual, I've never had a problem with feeling different or being different or doing different things.\u201d As a child, Arkani-Hamed loved physics, but he initially disliked almost everything about string theory. \u201cString theory just seemed like abstruse junk to me,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat I really liked was physics that explained things about the world around me.\u201d That changed when he began studying quantum field theory at the University of Toronto. At first, this complex theory \u2014 which underlies high-energy physics and much of string theory \u2014 seemed too arcane, but as he studied it more carefully, he found a level of order and explanation far beyond anything he had learned before. \u201cClearly, there was something very deep going on,\u201d he says. It captivated him, and by the time he finished graduate school in 1997, he knew he wanted to try to make string theory experimentally verifiable. He found an ally and mentor in Dimopoulos, who has devoted his career to seeking testable versions of string theory. \u201cWe believe that the only way to make progress is to take an idea, and push its consequences to find observations,\u201d Dimopoulos says. These days, in late-night phone calls and frequent e-mails, the two are thinking about what might emerge at the Large Hadron Collider. Their current calculations show that some of the energy created by particle collisions in the machine could escape into extra dimensions, carried off by leaking gravity, if those dimensions are large enough. The result would be an apparent violation of the conservation of energy \u2014 a dramatic sign that string theorists are on the right track. Then again, they might not be. \u201cYou can spend ten years of your life and every idea you come up with can be wrong, and that's gratifying in its own way,\u201d Arkani-Hamed says. But, he adds, as he reaches his caffeine-fuelled conclusion: \u201cIf this thing turned out to be true, it could be the biggest discovery in science in, say, 300 years.\u201d \n                     Upper limits to submillimetre-range forces from extra space-time dimensions \n                   \n                     Gravity: The weight of expectation \n                   \n                     Brane new world \n                   \n                     Fundamental physics: Newton rules (for now) \n                   \n                     Arkani-Hamed's page at Harvard \n                   \n                     String theory \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Are nightclub lights and designer chemicals the answer? Federica Castellani finds out. Every year some 300,000 people visit the world-famous Lascaux cave in southern France to see its prehistoric paintings. But those who are not forewarned are liable to be disappointed: the cave they enter is only a replica, created 200 metres away from the original. The real cave was closed to the public in 1963, after it was found that a combination of carbon dioxide from visitors' breath and microbes on the rock surface were devouring the artwork. Lascaux is not alone. One after another, the doors to subterranean cultural treasures across Europe have been shut. Such drastic measures have long seemed to be the only way to preserve these sites, as cleaning the walls with disinfectants can seriously damage the delicate paintings. But Lascaux and places like it could eventually be reopened as a result of a European research programme aimed at understanding the ecology of the paint-eating microbes. As it turns out, it is much more effective to be subtle. Where harsh chemicals have failed, rays of blue or green light are succeeding. Lascaux closed when patches of algae and moss began to spread across the walls, the result of local climate changes caused by the intense flow of visitors and strong illumination. Even back then, the cave attracted more than 1,000 people per day, all curious to see the \u2018Sistine Chapel of its time\u2019 with its 17,000-year-old paintings. Once sealed, the cave's climate and its art returned to their original state. Today the air and paintings are monitored by computer-controlled sensors. \n               Under attack \n             Over the years, archaeologists and microbiologists have discovered a huge variety of microbes attacking subterranean monuments. Despite the nutrient-poor conditions, colonies of algae, mosses, bacteria and fungi all find ways to survive. Conservators have tried using fungicides, bactericides and quicklime to control them, but with limited success. \u201cTo throw chemicals crudely at the problem is not ideal because they can cause their own damage,\u201d says Patrizia Albertano, a biologist at the University of Rome \u2018Tor Vergata\u2019 and coordinator of the European research programme. But gentler microbicides that target specific types of organism can also be ineffective because they just shift the balance to other species within the colony. Unlike the simple layer of mould that sometimes grows in a bathroom, the colonies that invade newly opened subterranean sites develop into complex communities of interdependent species. The only way to tackle these effectively without harsh treatments is to research the exact constituents. \u201cWe need to understand the biology of the biodiversity as a whole and work out how best to control growth and damage,\u201d says Albertano. \u201cThis isn't easy as the range of microbes is so great.\u201d Albertano's team, made up of ten groups from six European countries, has focused on the cause of most of the damage: biofilms, complex mats of interacting microorganisms. The scientists selected three study sites where the ambient conditions are typical of many famous archaeological remains in southern Europe. Two are in Rome \u2014 the catacombs of Domitilla and San Callisto with their third-century frescoes, which are among the earliest known Christian paintings. The other is the Cave of Bats in Zuheros, southern Spain, which contains remarkable geological formations and Palaeolithic rock paintings. \n               Eaten away \n             In the Roman catacombs, the researchers were faced with extensive patches of green on the frescoes. They found that the dominant organisms in these biofilms were cyanobacteria. Through their ability to photosynthesize, the cyanobacteria were supporting the growth of a great variety of bacteria and fungi, thus accelerating the spread of the biofilm. The acids produced by the other members of the colony were causing \u2018biocorrosion\u2019, a normal phenomenon along rocky coastlines. \u201cBut in this case,\u201d says Albertano, \u201cit was destroying the frescoes.\u201d Considered to be the ancestors of plants, cyanobacteria depend on sunlight. Yet they can get by in places with poor light, and are found in very dimly lit caves. When their underground dwellings are flooded with artificial light, the bacteria begin to grow wildly. The same is true of algae \u2014 which the team found in the Cave of Bats \u2014 and mosses. Such photosynthetic species are the anchors for the entire biofilm, and the by-products of their metabolism feed all manner of microbes in the colony. Light, the team realized, might be the biofilms' Achilles' heel. To find out, the researchers used a spectroradiometer, which identifies the wavelengths of light that a surface absorbs and reflects. The cyanobacteria in the catacombs absorbed light from the full visible spectrum except for a narrow band in the blue region. In theory, if the catacombs were lit with only that blue light, the microbes should stop growing. Albertano's team tested the idea in a chamber of San Callisto called the Cubiculum of the Ocean. Bulbs emitting the correct wavelength were hard to find, but the group eventually got some from a company that supplies lights to nightclubs. Under the blue light, the biofilm's growth rate has decreased noticeably (P. Albertano  et al . in  Molecular Biology and Cultural Heritage  151\u2013162; Balkema, Lisse, 2003). But Albertano says she is reserving judgement on the long-term effectiveness of the technique until sometime this year. The same approach was taken at the Cave of Bats, where a species of green algae is the anchor for the biofilm. Like all green plants, their colour is a reflection \u2014 literally \u2014 of the wavelengths of light they cannot use. So the cave is now bathed in pure green light. \u201cWe certainly see that green algae and also mosses grow more slowly under green light and eventually die,\u201d says Mariona Hern\u00e1ndez-Marin\u00e9, a pharmacologist at the University of Barcelona and a member of the team. Do visitors mind having to squint through monochromatic light? Apparently not, according to a questionnaire given out by the team at San Callisto. Most tourists said that they preferred the coloured light to the alternative of reducing the number of visitors. \n               Community service \n             But monochromatic light won't work at all sites. In some caves, biofilms trap nutrients carried down from the surface by seeping groundwater. And in caves that have both cyanobacterial and moss-fed biofilms, neither blue nor green light is a total solution. In such places, it may be possible to target chemical agents essential to biofilm growth. One possibility is a group of compounds called siderophores, which are used by bacteria to absorb iron, a nutrient they need to produce essential enzymes. The researchers reason that the judicious application of siderophores produced in the lab could soak up iron before the bacteria can make use of it, and so inhibit their growth. Such an approach is being tested by VTT Biotechnology near Helsinki, Finland, as a way to reduce salmonella infections in chicken houses. Another option is to interfere with communication between bacterial cells. Bacteria can grow and divide individually without doing too much damage to the rocks. They only form destructive biofilms when their population density reaches a certain threshold. The cells detect the surrounding population by sensing the concentration of secreted molecules called AHLs, or  N -acylhomoserine lactones. A chemical method that blocks or destroys AHLs could prevent a biofilm from forming at all. Such chemical methods are still under development and have yet to be tried in the caves. But if they work, they could be combined with pure light to allow archaeological sites currently sealed off for protection to reopen to the public. \u201cThese biocleaning procedures may develop into a valuable alternative to bactericides and fungicides, and would be less dangerous for the health of researchers and visitors,\u201d Albertano says. Will visitors get a second chance to see the original Lascaux cave? The San Callisto catacombs have remained open to the public, and the Cubiculum remains illuminated by pure blue light.

{"file_id": "433102a", "url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/433102a", "year": 2005, "authors": [{"name": "Peter Aldhous"}], "parsed_as_year": "2006_or_before", "body": "Having suffered heavily from avian influenza in 2004, Vietnam might now be brewing the next human flu pandemic. Yet, as Peter Aldhous discovers, local researchers don't have the resources to investigate the risk properly.  Each year around the end of January, the swarm of motor scooters on the streets of Ho Chi Minh City thins out as offices and shops shut down. Tet, the lunar New Year festival, is a time for rest and family gatherings. But things were far from restful this time last year, as disease stalked the city. At the Hospital for Tropical Diseases and the nearby Pasteur Institute, Tet celebrations were forgotten as virologists raced to analyse nose and throat swabs taken from patients with respiratory problems, looking for the deadly H5N1 avian influenza virus. \u201cI worked ten hours a day, seven days a week,\u201d recalls Tran Tan Thanh, a virologist at the hospital. Now there are fears of a repeat performance for this year's Tet. Two Vietnamese boys have died of avian flu since 30 December and, as  Nature  went to press, a 16-year-old girl remained critically ill. H5N1 avian flu swept through Asian poultry flocks in 2004. And the latest human cases bring the death toll to at least 22 people in Vietnam and a further 12 in Thailand. If the virus evolves to become easily transmissible from person to person, H5N1 has the potential to trigger a pandemic that could claim millions of lives worldwide. This is why public-health experts worry that more isn't being done to understand the outbreak, and to monitor for the virus. Vietnam is a particular concern. Not only has the virus hit this country especially hard, but the population still lives day-to-day in close quarters with chickens and ducks. The good news is that Vietnam has just enough scientific infrastructure from which to build a proper monitoring effort. But experts on the ground complain that the international community hasn't prioritized such efforts \u2014 leaving them frustrated by a lack of funding, and alarmed by what might happen next. \u201cThere has been a large amount of activity, but it could do with more energy, more money and more communication,\u201d says Peter Horby, who is responsible for communicable disease surveillance at the office of the World Health Organization (WHO) in the Vietnamese capital, Hanoi. \n               Initial outbreak \n             Before the first human cases emerged last year, H5N1 flu had been working its way through Asian poultry flocks for several months, triggering widespread culls of chickens throughout the region. Researchers knew that transmission of the virus to humans was a possibility. And on 8 January 2004, virologist Le Thi Quynh Mai and her team at the National Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology (NIHE) in Hanoi confirmed these fears, showing that a Vietnamese patient was suffering from H5N1. More cases were soon identified. And in the initial stages, those at the sharp end knew that there was no time for delay, nor any room for error. \u201cThis really was crisis diagnostics,\u201d says Menno de Jong, who had moved from Amsterdam only months before to help establish the virology lab at Ho Chi Minh City's Hospital for Tropical Diseases. In the weeks following Mai's identification of the initial human case, her lab and the two main diagnostic labs in Ho Chi Minh City worked closely with a team of 28 international experts sent in by the WHO and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \u2014 who brought with them badly needed reagents, and considerable expertise. A paper describing the first ten Vietnamese patients with H5N1 influenza was soon on its way to  The New England Journal of Medicine , and appeared online on 25 February 1 . All in all, Vietnam's response to the health emergency has won cautious praise. \u201cThey are doing a good job, given the circumstances and the amount of funds,\u201d says Horby. From the start, Vietnamese officials seemed determined to avoid the mistakes made in China a year previously, when secrecy hampered the international response to the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS. Phan Van Tu, who heads the Ho Chi Minh City Pasteur Institute's microbiology and immunology department, makes a point of showing me an official data sheet recording all human cases of H5N1 flu in each of the 20 provinces in southern Vietnam. \u201cWe don't hide anything,\u201d he says. But the initial momentum has not been maintained. Today, the crisis teams that helped with the initial diagnosis and epidemiology have long since departed. Yet the need for surveillance of H5N1 and other flu viruses has scarcely diminished \u2014 all of the ingredients to brew a pandemic strain of influenza are still in place, and people continue to get infected. In addition to the latest crop of cases, four deaths were confirmed between August and September 2004. \n               Living with danger \n              Vietnam's economy may be growing rapidly, but the vast majority of its people are still small-scale farmers who share their living space with chickens and ducks. \u201cThe hinterland of Vietnam is, for all practical purposes, one huge free-roaming farm,\u201d says Anton Rychener, who heads the Hanoi office of the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). This, experts agree, provides the ideal breeding ground for deadly strains of flu, which are likely to emerge when viruses pass between different species of livestock and people, and exchange genetic material in the process. Similar conditions prevail in southern China, although no human cases of H5N1 flu were reported there in 2004. That may be a true reflection of the Chinese situation, but few experts believe that H5N1 has claimed no human victims in Cambodia and Laos, given the distribution of the disease in poultry \u2014 it's just that these two impoverished countries have negligible disease surveillance. Thailand, meanwhile, has reported human deaths. But some experts question privately whether Thailand's desire to protect lucrative poultry exports has prevented it from acknowledging the true extent of infection in its flocks. So Vietnam may present the best opportunity to get a handle on the risks posed by H5N1 influenza, and to answer some nagging questions. Comparison of the current crisis with previous experiences of the virus, for example, reveals some mysteries. When H5N1 first made the jump from poultry to people in 1997 in Hong Kong \u2014 an outbreak that was thankfully contained by culling stocks \u2014 the human cases spanned a wide age range 2 . Most of these cases were linked to exposure to chickens at live poultry markets. But in Vietnam and Thailand, the human cases have all been in children or young adults. And there is no clear link between the human cases and occupational exposure to poultry. None of the 15,000 or so Vietnamese workers who culled millions of chickens at the height of the outbreak became sick, even though most of them did not wear protective clothing. One theory is that Vietnamese adults, particularly those who work closely with poultry, have some immunity to H5N1, perhaps through earlier exposure to a related avian flu virus. But Vietnamese children would have no such earlier exposure, and could come into contact with the virus by playing with poultry in their backyards. The first case to show up in Ho Chi Minh City, for instance, was an eight-year-old girl who had kept a pet duck that became sick and died 1 . To confirm or refute such theories, researchers will have to look at a large number of human blood samples to see who has antibodies against H5N1. Detailed epidemiological data will also be needed to work out how these people were exposed to the virus. At the same time, researchers want to examine poultry, other livestock and migratory birds \u2014 the last of which may play a role in spreading H5N1 (ref.  3 ) \u2014 to see whether they carry antibodies against the virus. Domestic ducks are a particular concern, as they can become infected and excrete large quantities of the virus in their faeces without becoming obviously sick 4 . This silent reservoir of infection probably explains why H5N1 began showing up in Vietnamese chickens again in late June, after being declared eradicated at the end of March. Monitoring the genetic evolution of H5N1 will also be key to assessing the danger that it poses. Despite one report of a Thai woman being infected by her daughter, there is so far no clear evidence that H5N1 is passing from person to person. But the big fear is that it will slowly adapt to infecting mammals, or exchange genes with a human flu virus to create a lethal and easily transmissible strain. If that occurs, we would soon have a global health emergency on our hands. It is already clear that the viruses that caused the current outbreak are subtly different, genetically, from those that hit Hong Kong in 1997 (ref.  3 ). And there are ominous suggestions that H5N1 is evolving to infect a wider range of species. Robert Webster, a leading influenza virologist at St Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee, in unpublished work has found that H5N1 can infect pigs. Viruses isolated from a Vietnamese patient have already been shown to cause disease in domestic cats 5 , which are usually resistant to influenza A, the subtype to which H5N1 belongs. And in October, there was an outbreak of H5N1 flu in tigers at a zoo in eastern Thailand. \n               Increasing threat \n             Findings from Chinese veterinary scientists, working with Webster, have caused further alarm. They sampled H5N1 viruses from ducks in southern China between 1999 and 2002, and transmitted them to mice. Judging from these experiments, H5N1 has become progressively more pathogenic to mammals 4 . And in further unpublished work, Webster infected ducks with H5N1 samples collected in Vietnam in 2003 and 2004; those given the 2004 isolates excreted the virus for a longer period. Yet despite these troubling results and the yawning gaps in our knowledge of the dangers posed by H5N1, it is proving tough to find funding for surveillance in Vietnam. Such work falls between the cracks, says Horby: it isn't covered by the initial crisis response to a disease outbreak, and conventional channels of scientific grant funding are too sluggish. So Horby has, until now, had to scramble around for small amounts of aid money to launch studies to survey people for H5N1 antibodies. Unfortunately, this doesn't provide much scope for building up the scientific infrastructure required if such studies are to be conducted routinely in Vietnam.  Vietnamese officials are reluctant to criticize the international response to the H5N1 outbreak. But foreign scientists working in Vietnam are less polite. \u201cWhen there's a problem, everyone flies in, creates a certain amount of havoc, flies out, and leaves nothing behind to change the situation,\u201d complains Jeremy Farrar, who heads the Oxford University Clinical Research Unit at the Hospital for Tropical Diseases in Ho Chi Minh City.  Kenjiro Inui, a virologist seconded to the National Institute of Veterinary Research in Hanoi by the Japan International Cooperation Agency, echoes Farrar's view. After the initial outbreak, he says, the institute was deluged with requests from foreign scientists who wanted to come and collect samples for their projects. But it was unclear how this would benefit the Vietnamese partners. And offers to help Vietnamese scientists build their monitoring infrastructure were thin on the ground. \u201cEveryone is welcome,\u201d says Inui, \u201cbut you can't come here just to get samples...\u201d Inui's colleague Nguyen Tien Dung glances at him wryly and finishes his sentence for him: \u201c...and then run away.\u201d But Dung is pleased with his ongoing collaborations with Webster and another leading authority on flu viruses, Malik Peiris of the University of Hong Kong, to investigate the evolution of H5N1 in Vietnamese livestock. Researchers from the Hanoi veterinary institute have also visited Hong Kong for training. \n               Emergency team \n             De Jong and Thanh's diagnostic lab further illustrates what's possible through a genuine collaboration. It is part of Farrar's unit in Ho Chi Minh City, which is financed jointly by the Vietnamese government and the Wellcome Trust, Britain's largest medical research charity. If the virology lab hadn't been in place, says Tran Tinh Hien, deputy director of the Hospital for Tropical Diseases, the situation last January would have been chaotic. \u201cPatients were in panic,\u201d Hien recalls. \u201cAs soon as people got respiratory symptoms, they came to us.\u201d The viral lab's rapid diagnostic work allowed doctors quickly to determine the combination of symptoms likely to represent a case of H5N1 flu \u2014 including severe lesions on chest X-rays, a high fever, and a reduced count of white blood cells 1 . So most patients could be reassured that they weren't infected with the killer virus, and were sent home. \u201cIt was very important that we had this diagnostic capacity,\u201d says Hien. But hospitals in the less-developed central regions of the country can't call on state-of-the-art diagnostic labs. This is a source of concern for Mai, who fears that human H5N1 cases may have been missed. Her lab at the NIHE was sent some samples from suspected cases in central Vietnam last year. But by the time the samples had reached Hanoi, they had degraded and couldn't be analysed. Even if surveillance for human cases is improved, that still leaves the mammoth task of looking for the virus in poultry and other livestock. Here, there is a huge amount of work to be done, if Vietnam's capacity is to be brought up to the desired standard. At present, some local veterinary offices lack even basics such as reliable phone and fax connections. \u201cWe must strengthen the capacity of staff, and improve working conditions, equipment and infrastructure at the lower levels,\u201d says Hoang Van Nam, chief of epidemiology in the agriculture ministry's Department of Animal Health. The FAO has recognized the problem, and with the World Bank has put together a two-year Avian Influenza Emergency Recovery Project for Vietnam, which includes US$2.8 million for lab diagnostics, surveillance in the field, and other research into avian flu. But Rychener argues that much larger sums are needed, given that H5N1 is now believed to be endemic in southeast Asia. \u201cThe international community is not reacting properly,\u201d he says. \u201cIt underestimates the gravity of the situation.\u201d Just imagine, Rychener adds, the huge sums of money that would be mobilized if a similar situation were to emerge in Europe or North America. \u201cBut here, we are talking about chicken feed.\u201d \n                     Fear of human pandemic grows as bird flu sweeps through Asia \n                   \n                     Bird Flu In Focus \n                   \n                     WHO avian flu \n                   \n                     FAO avian flu \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},
{"file_id": "433188a", "url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/433188a", "year": 2005, "authors": [{"name": "Alison Abbott"}], "parsed_as_year": "2006_or_before", "body": "Exercise is good for you, or so we always thought. But, as Alison Abbott learns, your genes don't always cooperate.  When Claude Bouchard set out to see whether genes play a role in physical fitness, he assumed, like most people, that exercise training makes everyone fitter. Although he expected genes to modulate some individual responses to diet and exercise, he also anticipated that regular workouts would improve fitness indicators such as lung efficiency and blood cholesterol for everybody. Some 20 years later, it has become clear from the work of Bouchard and others that this is not the case. Looking at certain measures of fitness, some people actually fare worse after exercise, whereas others show little or no improvement.  But this isn't vindication for couch potatoes. Everyone's health improves in some way or other from exercise, but just how it improves is largely dependent on genes. Now, the growing field of fitness genetics is attempting to tease those genetic components apart, and the studies are generating fresh insights into the benefits of exercise as well as unexpected pay-offs for medicine. Bouchard's attempts to track fitness genes began in the mid-1980s at Laval University in Quebec, Canada. He and his colleagues focused on the maximum amount of oxygen absorbed by the body from a lungful of air \u2014 a standard measure of aerobic fitness, usually abbreviated as  \\(V_{{\\rm O}_2 \\max } \\) . They found that most people can get more oxygen out of each breath after training but that a minority were no better off, regardless of how efficient their lungs were at the start. Because the variation was much less extreme within pairs of identical twins, Bouchard concluded that the effect was largely dictated by genes 1 . That initial study was fairly small, so Bouchard extended the work in 1992 by helping to set up a multicentre research effort called the HERITAGE Family Study, which is still running today. Now based \u2014 together with Bouchard \u2014 at the Pennington Biomedical Research Center in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, the study's main data set comes from some 740 sedentary adults who were subjected to an intense exercise regime in the lab. The researchers monitored changes in the participants' blood pressure, heart rate, blood chemistry and  \\(V_{{\\rm O}_2 \\max } \\)  over 20 weeks. \n               Survival of the fittest \n              The study's main aim was to determine how exercise reduces risk factors for cardiovascular disease and diabetes, but Bouchard and researchers at the four other collaborating institutions also took blood samples for genetic analysis. \u201cWe were trying to find as many genes as possible that influence fitness and performance,\u201d Bouchard says. The resulting reams of data and frozen blood samples are still being analysed, but the results so far confirm Bouchard's earlier studies. The average increase in  \\(V_{{\\rm O}_2 \\max } \\)  after the training programme was 19%. But 5% of the subjects had virtually no change, and another 5% had improved by more than twice the average amount. Similarly, most people had lower exercising heart rates and blood pressure after the training programme \u2014 an indication of improved fitness \u2014 but the extent of the reduction was extremely variable. In a few people there was even a small rise in these numbers 2 . Much of this variability seems to be attributable to genes. The researchers found more variation between than within families, suggesting at least a portion of a person's ability to benefit from exercise is inherited. \u201cWe concluded that just about half of the difference in trainability was heritable,\u201d says Tuomo Rankinen, the study's project manager. It is unclear to what extent fitness parameters such as  \\(V_{{\\rm O}_2 \\max } \\)  are indicative of long-term health prospects, but even presumed health indicators such as cholesterol, a factor in heart disease, did not follow the expected pattern of more exercise is better. Conventional wisdom has it that regular exercise reduces the risk of heart disease by raising blood levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, a complex that helps prevent cholesterol from forming fatty deposits on blood-vessel walls. This is considered one of the key benefits of taking up sports such as running. But the HERITAGE data show that training does not inevitably increase levels of HDL cholesterol. In fact, in about one-third of exercisers, the level of the complex fell. Does this all mean that exercise could actually be bad for those of us with the \u2018wrong genes\u2019? Not at all, insists Rankinen. \u201cWe found not a single \u2018universal non-responder\u2019,\u201d he says. In other words, everyone improved on some score. Even those who could not raise their  \\(V_{{\\rm O}_2 \\max } \\)  through exercise were still getting some other health benefit such as higher HDL cholesterol levels or lower blood pressure. And overall, the HERITAGE data show that the risk of cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes falls in those who exercise regularly, Rankinen says. One way to begin to untangle these apparently contradictory effects is to go after the genes involved. This could ultimately reveal a great deal about how exercise produces health benefits, and may lead to treatments for diseases of metabolism and physiology. To this end, scientists at the HERITAGE study are scanning the genomes of participants for gene variants that occur more frequently in association with different fitness responses. Although some metabolism genes have been identified that may play a role, the most strongly linked gene so far is  Titin . This produces protein fibres that contribute to the elasticity of heart muscle cells. It may be that some forms of the gene allow the heart to pump larger volumes of blood than others 3 . \n               Physical attractions \n              Other teams are also on the hunt for fitness genes. Paul Williams, a health researcher at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in Berkeley, California, for instance, suspects that a gene related to the synthesis of HDL cholesterol might be involved. Ten years ago, he found that people who have an easier time taking up running after leading sedentary lives also started out with higher levels of HDL cholesterol in their blood \u2014 and increased those levels more quickly \u2014 than those who find running difficult 4 . It turns out that an enzyme that boosts HDL cholesterol is found in \u2018slow-twitch\u2019 muscle fibre, the type that takes longer to fatigue and so makes distance running easier. Williams is now beginning a large-scale genetic study to see whether differences in that enzyme are associated with differences in lifestyle choice. Meanwhile, Gaston Beunen, a sports scientist at the Catholic University of Leuven in Belgium, is looking at the half-dozen or so key genes that contribute to the synthesis of myostatin, a protein that blocks new muscle growth. His study of some 300 young sibling males, published in May last year, hints that three of these genes may help to determine a person's physical strength 5 . In the end, the number of fitness-linked genes is expected to be large. So far, more than 100 appear in the literature, most of which have been identified in the past four years 6 , although in many cases more work is needed to confirm the link. And some of these now seem likely to prove their worth in the clinic. One gene drawing a lot of attention encodes an enzyme called ACE, or angiotensin-converting enzyme. ACE activates the hormone angiotensin, which helps to maintain blood pressure and promotes the growth of the heart in response to exercise. One common gene variant, known as  ACE D , makes more ACE than the other common version,  ACE I . And athletes who have inherited  ACE D  from both parents experience about three times more heart growth in response to exercise than those who have inherited two  ACE I  genes 7 . They also seem to perform better in sports that rely on sheer strength and power, such as weight-lifting or sprinting. The  I  variant, in contrast, is more common among \u00e9lite athletes in endurance sports such as long-distance running and swimming, which require more efficient metabolic use of energy and oxygen 8 , 9 .  As the lower levels of ACE associated with  ACE I  improve endurance, Hugh Montgomery, a cardiovascular geneticist at University College London, wondered whether  ACE I  might also be advantageous to those suffering serious illness. He found that children with potentially deadly meningitis were more likely to require intensive care or to die if they had two copies of the  ACE D  gene rather than two copies of  ACE I 10 . His team also found that premature babies with  ACE I  fare better 11 . \u201cOur work on athletes is feeding back into the clinic,\u201d says Montgomery. \u201cHow efficiently we use oxygen is decisive when we are desperately sick.\u201d It may eventually be possible to help such patients with drugs that slow down ACE activity. Already, in unpublished work, ACE inhibitors have been shown to reduce muscle wasting in mice. And London-based drug company Ark Therapeutics is currently running final-stage clinical trials on the use of the ACE inhibitor imidapril to treat severe muscle wasting in cancer patients. Fitness genetics may be feeding ideas into the clinic, but could genetic destiny become a new excuse for couch potatoes? \u201cIf they think their performance is limited by their genes, people tend to give up,\u201d says Montgomery. \u201cPeople are afraid of trying and failing \u2014 it's part of the human condition.\u201d Nevertheless, his advice to those who long to be fitter is to do serious exercise come what may. For everyone, it seems, there is at least some benefit. \n                     http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/430603a \n                   \n                     The HERITAGE Family Study \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

As his plans for expansion step up a gear, Summers tells Helen Pearson why it is time for Cambridge to face up to the need for change. Two faces of Harvard University sit on opposite banks of the Charles River, and only one of them looks pretty. The attractive side is what you might expect from the oldest and most venerable seat of learning in the United States: weathered brick fa\u00e7ades, hushed rooms housing precious intellects, and rows of bicycles to ferry students to the some of the world's most hallowed lecture halls. The other face of Harvard is one with which few outsiders are familiar, and is, for now, a comparative wasteland. A motley collection of industrial plots, rail yards, disused warehouses and a second-hand car lot make up this side of the university, in the distinctly unprecious Boston suburb of Allston. It takes considerable imagination to envisage the wilderness of this second site being transformed into an academic hub as vibrant as its historic neighbour. But soon after Larry Summers became Harvard's president in 2001, that was the plan he put forward. Summers, a brilliant economist, gained national prominence as treasury secretary and economic adviser to President Bill Clinton. Under Summers' plan, Harvard intends to spend billions of dollars turning Allston into a campus whose size will eventually exceed that of the university's traditional base in Cambridge. \n               All change \n             The Allston plan is just part of Summers' mission to overhaul the university. He also wants to move science centre-stage in an institution that, although diverse, has traditionally enjoyed particular pre-eminence in the humanities. He plans to revamp undergraduate education \u2014 and, contentiously, he wants the central administration to exert more direct influence over the university's traditionally autonomous faculties. Summers' direct style and sweeping agenda have, unsurprisingly, managed to irk some Harvard academics. Although their criticism has mostly been internal and low-key, you don't have to wander the corridors there very long to find it. The critics object to the substance of Summers' plans, the way in which he has introduced them, and sometimes even to the man himself. \u201cSome members of faculty dislike him intensely,\u201d says one critic, particle physicist Gary Feldman. Summers understands these criticisms but contends that his plans' benefits will far outweigh any costs. The university, he says, is obliged to embrace the kinds of changes he has introduced if it is to retain its position as one of the world's pre-eminent academic institutions. \u201cIt worries me much more if a project has no enthusiastic champions than it does if it has a certain number of energetic detractors,\u201d he says. With a history, assets and a reputation as rich as Harvard's, there is plenty to lose if Summers is wrong. Founded in 1636, the university is the oldest higher-education institution in the United States. It is probably the wealthiest university in the world, boasting an endowment of more than $22 billion. On the academic front, Harvard also flaunts impressive credentials: it shares the number one spot with Princeton in the widely quoted  US News & World Report  rankings of US colleges for 2005, and at the last available count, boasted 156 members of the prestigious National Academy of Sciences \u2014 more than any other institution. Harvard's traditional position at the apex of the US university system also ensures that others tend to follow its lead on questions such as how undergraduate courses should be structured. Summers' management challenge at Harvard is magnified by the university's strongly decentralized structure. Its roughly 2,400-strong professorial staff is split into a loose federation of nine faculties. Most of these, including the Faculty of Arts and Sciences and Harvard Law School, tend to be clustered around historic Harvard Yard in Cambridge. A second campus, in the larger, neighbouring city of Boston, houses Harvard Medical School and the School of Public Health, and the third campus in Allston is already home to Harvard Business School. \n               The bottom line \n             A quaint Harvard expression \u2014 \u201cevery tub on its own bottom\u201d \u2014 is sometimes used to describe the large degree of autonomy that each faculty enjoys. The faculties maintain considerable control over their own affairs and budgets. Traditionally, the president's main activities have been raising funds externally, while offering gentle guidance to the powerful faculty deans. Summers' predecessor, Neil Rudenstine, is said by many staff to have fitted that mould. Summers stepped into the position in July 2001, when a colossal fund-raising drive by Rudenstine, as well as healthy growth of the endowment, had put the university in a particularly strong financial position. It was already poised to expand physically, after several years spent buying up wide swathes of land in Allston, but the university lacked concrete plans for how this should be done. The Harvard Corporation, the executive board that appointed Summers, clearly anticipated that his background would help him to make an impact at the university. After building his reputation as an economist at both Harvard and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Summers was appointed chief economist for the World Bank in 1991. Under Clinton, who was elected in 1992 largely on a pledge to fix the US economy, Summers came to the US Department of the Treasury, where he became secretary \u2014 and the president's chief economic adviser \u2014 in 1999. Summers shook things up at Harvard almost from the day he took over as president. In his inaugural address, he laid out plans to reform the university's undergraduate education, its decentralized structure and scientific research. By the end of 2001, he was engaged in a public row with Harvard's best-known African-American academic, the philosopher Cornel West, who subsequently resigned and moved to Princeton University in New Jersey. Encounters such as that one soon earned Summers a reputation among the staff as being opinionated, overly dismissive of their concerns, and even domineering. As one professor puts it, Summers is used to thinking of himself as the brightest person in the room. But in meetings at Harvard, he's likely to be dealing with people who have the same view of themselves. \n               Shaping history \n             In an interview last month at the New York Harvard Club, a hushed Manhattan building clad in the university's hallmark shade of crimson, Summers sketched out the key elements of his vision for the university. A major goal, he says, is for Harvard to invest more heavily in science, particularly in interdisciplinary research. \u201cI believe that when the history of this period is written 250 years from now, what happens in the life sciences and technology during the next quarter-century is likely to be a large part of it,\u201d he says. Without such an approach, he argues, Harvard risks losing its leadership position. \u201cOne of the ways in which some of the British universities have lost positions of pre-eminence is by inadequate investment in science,\u201d he notes. As part of this commitment, one of Summers' first steps in 2001 was to hire the then director of the National Institute of Mental Health, Steven Hyman, to be provost \u2014 in effect, his top administrator. The two have already overseen several new science initiatives, such as the establishment of the Harvard Stem Cell Institute \u2014 an effort to bring together researchers studying embryonic and adult stem cells \u2014 and a department of systems biology, which seeks to understand entire biological systems by analysing large data sets. Summers' ambitions for science are also evident in a vast, multibillion-dollar fund-raising drive just beginning at the university. Those involved say the details are undecided and that, at this stage, they are approaching key donors to build up the capital before making a public announcement. But they say that the campaign, which is likely to be seeking at least $4 billion, will probably be the largest the university has ever undertaken \u2014 and will be distinguished from those in the past by the large proportion of money devoted to science projects. To identify the scientific projects that Harvard should invest in, a 15-member task force, established in 2003 and led by Hyman, asked staff for their proposals. The group whittled down the 70 submitted to an initial shortlist of 13. These include a project to understand the origins of the life in the Universe involving biologists, chemists and astrophysicists, and one to tackle global health, which would bring together experts in areas such as infectious disease, mental health, diagnostics, policy, economics, law and bioethics. A second goal is to reform undergraduate education. Summers thinks that all undergraduates need to gain a more extensive grounding in modern scientific subjects such as genomics, so that they emerge as well versed in science as they are in the humanities. He also wants to see them all spend some time studying abroad. Both priorities are reflected in an undergraduate curriculum review currently under way at the university. A third intention of Summers, which he doesn't spell out quite so explicitly, is to transform the collection of traditionally autonomous faculties into a single, more coherent university. He has done this partly by introducing more scrutiny of each school's budget and tenure appointments. Summers argues that this kind of supervision can save the university money, ensure that academic standards are consistent across the institution, and help the university to address academic questions that fall beyond the scope of any individual faculty. \n               Foundation stones \n             All of these ambitions will, Summers believes, be furthered by the successful transformation of Allston into a vast, new academic centre. \u201cThe very substantial physical resources we have available in Allston will allow us to define the Harvard of the twenty-first century,\u201d he says. In a letter to the Harvard community on 21 October 2003, Summers outlined his ideas for renovating the 200 fragmented acres at Allston. He expects new science and technology facilities to form the heart of the new campus, alongside a new home for the School of Public Health and the Graduate School of Education, new student housing and an array of shops, museums and other attractions to ensure that students and staff alike flock to the site. The plans for Allston aren't yet complete. But the occupants of the first scientific labs there, probably including the new institute for stem-cell research, are expected to be announced in the first half of this year. Many academics, particularly those whose favourite projects are likely to benefit directly, are enthused by Summers' plans, and have embraced the opportunity to consider cross-cutting fields. \u201cNo past president has given us the freedom to think in those terms before,\u201d says chemist Greg Verdine, who has been involved in an initiative that combines chemistry and biology to, for example, try to adjust the action of biological molecules. But Allston, which embodies much of Summers' broader schemes for the university, has also become a focal point for criticism \u2014 particularly among scientists at Harvard. Problems flared up in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences in October 2003, when staff members were alerted to the release of Summers' letter in an e-mail that they received only a few hours before they were due to discuss it in a faculty meeting. In this meeting and subsequent ones, many staff members expressed doubts about the plan. \u201cTo say there is faculty concern and lack of enthusiasm is a massive understatement,\u201d says one staff member. \n               Critical point \n             Critics raise three main concerns. First, they say that Summers and the administration failed to discuss adequately the best course for the university's development, and that such consultations that did take place were purely cosmetic. \u201cAs far as I can tell, Larry and a bunch of other high-level officials met, and then Larry just decided what he wanted to say,\u201d says astrophysics professor Alyssa Goodman. Second, critics question whether an aggressive physical expansion is either desirable or necessary. They argue that the university could fulfil many of its needs for interdisciplinary work by careful expansion and collaboration within Cambridge, and point out that small departments can be intimate and advantageous for collaboration. \u201cBeing big doesn't necessarily mean being good,\u201d says Feldman. Third, they are uneasy about the isolation of the new campus. Its location, perhaps a 20\u201330-minute commute from the Cambridge campus, could divide rather than unite the scientific community, they say, interfering with the interdisciplinary collaborations it is supposed to nurture. They also worry that it could isolate science from the university's heart at Harvard Yard. \u201cI think creating a science ghetto is a bad idea,\u201d says Goodman. Summers and Hyman are unmoved by the criticisms. They claim that initial dissension over the Allston plans has dissipated as members of staff have had the chance to participate in the planning process, and get fired up about the opportunities there. \u201cIf you'd listened to the discussion that took place at a recent faculty meeting, it had a relatively different tone from that at the meeting a year ago,\u201d Summers observes. The two men also brush off the suggestion that expansion at Harvard is unnecessary. Growth and change, they say, is the only way to ensure that the university is able to fully engage in emerging areas of research 50 years from now. \u201cThe danger to Harvard is that people run the risk of becoming too comfortable and complacent because it is so successful,\u201d says Hyman. And they urge the critics to engage in the renovation process, instead of opposing it. \u201cI've asked people to focus their energy on what they want to do and how I can help them do it \u2014 and not to focus as much energy on what they think other people should not be allowed to do,\u201d Summers says. Whether academics choose to follow or fight Summers' advice, they do seem to be learning to live with his approach. Some say that they find his decisiveness refreshing \u2014 and preferable to the agonizingly slow and consultative process that sometimes dogged decision-making in the past. \u201cEvery time you make a big, bold decision you're going to piss people off \u2014 but presidents have to do that,\u201d says professor of psychology Marc Hauser. Nevertheless, in a place that thrives on academic debate, Summers' combative approach will continue to send ripples of dissent through the quads and corridors. And Summers has yet to impress everyone that his way of working is suited to the venerable institution. \u201cYou don't run Harvard the way you run the Department of the Treasury,\u201d says history of science professor Everett Mendelsohn. \n                     Harvard heralds fresh take on systems biology \n                   \n                     Postgenomics: Harvard's melting pot \n                   \n                     Harvard University \n                   \n                     Allston Initiative \n                   \n                     The Harvard Guide \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Reaching scientific greatness at such a young age was exceptional then and may be even harder today. But when looking at physics in the twenty-first century, there's still much to discover by asking a young physicist: what's your theory? In the following pages,  Nature  offers a glimpse into the lives of four young theorists (all under 35) who are making waves in their chosen fields. In Einstein's youth, the focus of theoretical physics was in Europe: Niels Bohr was in Copenhagen, Max Planck was in Berlin. Today it is harder to find the centre of the theoretical universe \u2014 collaborative research is increasingly international, and most theorists, who need little more than a laptop, can work anywhere. But it seems that many young theorists opt to spend their formative years in the United States. Although US enrolment of foreign graduate students has fallen in recent years, they still make up about half of the total in physics, and of these some 40% are theorists. Not all of these students will stay in the United States \u2014 many, including three featured here, will head for good positions back home.  All of our interviewees share a willingness to push big ideas forwards while also asking how \u2014 and how soon \u2014 they can be tested. Einstein had to wait just a few years for predictions from his 1915 general theory of relativity to be confirmed by observations of a solar eclipse. But many theorists finish their careers without seeing any experimental check on their ideas. Our young theorists not only know that they must think big, but also that they must pit their wildest theories against reality. Over the next few years, many theorists will be directing their attention to the world's largest particle accelerator, currently being built near Geneva in Switzerland, for experimental confirmation of their ideas. Here, physicists hope to find some support for exotic notions such as extra dimensions (see \u2018In search of hidden dimensions\u2019,  page 10 ). Elsewhere, missions such as the Planck satellite will provide data on the early Universe that may help to shore up theories about the moment of creation (see \u2018The long-distance thinker\u2019,  page 12 ). The hoped-for construction of the first quantum computer would test fundamental ideas about the quantum world (see \u2018A theorist of errors\u2019,  page 9 ), whereas the creation of exotic materials is continually pushing our knowledge of electron behaviour (see \u2018Can electrons do the splits?\u2019,  page 11 ). As we look back at the past 100 years and celebrate the World Year of Physics in 2005, there are still plenty of twentieth-century puzzles that theorists would like to complete, but there is also the tantalizing possibility that something totally unknown is just around the corner. It will be young theorists such as those featured here who will tackle these challenges. Reprints and Permissions"},

Sitting in Ahungalla, 30 kilometres north of hard-hit Galle on the southwest tip of Sri Lanka when last month's tsunami rolled in, he got a fresh perspective on earthquakes and their impact. Fortunately, Chapman, who works at Schlumberger Cambridge Research in Britain, was able to surmize the danger and initiate efforts to clear the beaches. He tells David Cyranoski about the experience. \n               Where were you when the tsunami first hit? \n             It was 9:30 a.m. and we \u2014my wife Lillian and I \u2014 were just finishing breakfast in the ground-floor restaurant of our hotel, which overlooks the beach and the swimming pool. The earthquake had occurred at 7:00, but we didn't feel it. The sea rose a few metres, although we didn't notice until a fairly small wave rolled gently through the swimming pool and lobby of the hotel. Everyone just stopped what they were doing and watched in amazement. It only left a couple of inches of water in the lobby but there was sand and debris in the swimming pool. When we asked the hotel staff if this had ever happened before, they said \u201cnever\u201d. People talked of a particularly high tide, but that just didn't seem right to me. \n               What were your initial thoughts? \n             I had read about tsunamis when I was a student, especially from the big earthquake that occurred in Alaska in 1964. But I had never experienced one. I said to my wife that there must have been an earthquake in the Indian Ocean. When she asked if there was more to come, I said possibly but that it was probably from a small earthquake on a nearby plate boundary, and that this first wave was all that was going to happen. Nevertheless she went off and spoke to the hotel manager and warned him that there had been an earthquake and there might be more to come. She's Canadian, and she's always found English understatement difficult to understand. \n               When did you know that things would get worse? \n             At 9:50 the sea was far below its normal level. That was about when I said to my wife that this was going to be something big. She is more outgoing than me, so she rushed back to the hotel manager and told him to get people off the beach. The sea level was continuing to go down. By 10:05 it was several metres below normal. \n               What kind of response did you get? \n             The hotel manager was extremely good. As soon as my wife said what might happen, he got his staff out to the beach with megaphones and told people to come in. By the time the sea level started to rise again, we were all near the hotel; not necessarily on higher floors, but within running distance of the stairs. There was no panic until about 10:10, at which point the water was coming in very quickly. The striking thing was not the wave but the speed and sheer volume of water. It was amazing. The water took 35 minutes to retreat, but only 7 minutes to come back in. Fortunately no one from our hotel was lost. \n               How high was the wave in the end? \n             I didn't see it because I was running for my life. It's difficult to estimate heights, but the total rise was 5 to 10 metres above sea level. \n               Your PhD thesis was on the diffraction of seismic waves and you're familiar with laws describing the dispersion of water waves \u2014 were these things rattling around in your head? \n             Not at those moments, no. I was, later, trying to figure out the pattern to the waves. After the big one, there were further waves at 11:10 and 11:50. These were just as big as the first wave that hit the swimming pool, so people began to panic again \u2014 but none was as big as the second wave. When I returned to England, I started re-reading about tsunami theory, but at the time I wasn't thinking about these things. I had gone on holiday to forget about them. \n               Some say that your efforts saved hundreds of lives. Is that really the case? \n             Well, hundreds is certainly an exaggeration, but maybe a few. It wasn't me alone \u2014 it was also my wife and then the staff who responded so quickly. I have also read newspaper articles about a young girl who had studied tsunamis in school and told her parents what was going on; they also immediately went to a higher floor. It goes to show how useful education can be. \n                     http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/433350a \n                   \n                     http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/news050103-6 \n                   \n                     http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/news050110-10 \n                   \n                     http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/425649a \n                   \n                     Tsunami in focus \n                   \n                     Tsunami special \n                   \n                     Chris Chapman \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

But she pursued other interests before finally settling on quantum computation. Haim Watzman reports. To enter Dorit Aharonov's office is to experience a sudden transition between order and disorder. The corridors of the computer-science building at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem are stark, white and neat. Aharonov's office is a jumble of red-and-orange patterned cushions, article reprints and wicker furniture. It's an appropriate setting for a theorist who has proved that when disorder reaches a certain level, the physics of the quantum realm switches into the classical domain of the world we see every day. Aharonov devotes herself to the theory behind quantum computers. As-yet unbuilt, these machines would harness the power of quantum mechanics to perform tasks that defeat conventional computers \u2014 such as factoring large numbers. Aharonov, now 34, has already made important contributions to this goal by showing that a quantum computer could perform reliably and accurately despite a \u2018noisy\u2019 environment. Physics runs strong in Aharonov's family. Her uncle, Yakir Aharonov, is a physicist at Tel Aviv University, and her father is a mathematician who taught her the beauty of numbers when she was little. She later chose physics and mathematics for her undergraduate studies, but the quantum world did not initially capture her imagination. She wanted instead to use physics to study the brain. \n               A chance encounter \n             \u201cI wanted to solve the problem of consciousness,\u201d she recalls. But she began to think that the problem was still beyond the reach of today's science. \u201cThen, one day, at a wedding, a friend asked me for advice about what direction to take in the study of the brain. I advised him to check out what people in computer science were doing,\u201d she says. Realizing she should take her own advice, Aharonov went to the Hebrew University's computer-science building to find someone to talk to. She was directed to Michael Ben-Or and, as she knocked on his door, she says that she had a strong feeling something important was going to happen. It did. Ben-Or told her about quantum computation. \u201cIt fascinated me. It was mathematics, physics and philosophy all in one package,\u201d she says. Back then, in 1994, the problem facing theorists such as Ben-Or was how to prevent a quantum computer from crashing. All computers make errors when they operate, but quantum computers are more susceptible to failure. This is because the quantum states on which calculations depend are very delicate: complex phenomena, such as the spin states of atomic nuclei, can store quantum information but this data can easily be lost if the particles interact with their surroundings. A computer can never be perfectly isolated from its environment, so there will always be \u2018noise\u2019 in the system and, inevitably, errors will arise. Moreover, correcting such errors is almost as difficult as doing the calculation in the first place. So will it ever be possible to do a reliable quantum calculation? \u201cThat was the problem I posed to Dorit,\u201d says Ben-Or, who became Aharonov's dissertation supervisor and later her collaborator. Working with Ben-Or, Aharonov proved that at a constant but low level of system noise, a quantum computer can still produce accurate results 1 .  \u201cI consider her to be one of the most outstanding young people in this field,\u201d says Peter Zoller, a theoretical physicist at the University of Innsbruck, Austria. Zoller wants to build a quantum computer, and he says that Aharonov has been instrumental in laying the theoretical foundations on which a real machine could be constructed. As well as her work on error tolerance, he cites an important proof 2  Aharonov developed with Oded Regev and others while working at the University of California, Berkeley. The proof showed that two existing models for quantum computing are actually equivalent and, as a result, made writing quantum algorithms easier. While at Berkeley, Aharonov extended her work on computers to address a fundamental puzzle presented by quantum mechanics \u2014 why its laws are evident in the world of elementary particles, but not in everyday life. At what point does the world switch from looking quantum to looking classical? Is it simply a matter of scale? Aharonov showed that for many noisy quantum systems, there is a level of noise above which a transition to classical behaviour is inevitable. Such transitions are much sharper than expected from other theories that predict a gradual shift away from quantum behaviour 3 . Ben-Or says that what sets Aharonov apart is her boldness. As a graduate student she was not shy about contacting leading figures in the field to discuss their work, he recalls. Zeph Landau, a mathematician at the City College of New York who collaborated with Aharonov on the model equivalence paper, says that she is focused but not single-minded, finding time to discuss other pursuits.  Aharonov says that balancing life and work is essential to her research. Like many theorists, she says that she has her best ideas when not thinking about work at all. Her daily yoga session is particularly rewarding, she says: \u201cIt disperses the fog. My intuition becomes sharper. When there is less struggle, ideas become clear.\u201d Eastern ideas about the interconnectedness of everything also influence her work. For instance, Aharonov is not fixated on the actual construction of a quantum computer. \u201cThe most interesting thing that might come out of an attempt to build one is the discovery that we can't do it,\u201d she says. By failing, she adds, we might discover some entirely new physics. \n                     Quantum computing gets a step closer \n                   \n                     Aharonov's homepage: \n                   \n                     Zoller's homepage \n                   \n                     Centre for Quantum Computation at Oxford \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

As this treasure trove begins to yield its secrets, Rex Dalton finds local scientists hoping to unravel the mysteries of the earliest settlers of America. Deep in the jungle of Mexico's Yucat\u00e1n peninsula, away from the flocks of tourists at the Mayan pyramids and temples, a water-filled cavern is giving local scientists a glimpse much further back in time. Within this vine-draped sinkhole, a long passageway leads to a near-complete skeleton. Found by archaeological divers a few years ago, early evidence indicates that the remains are at least 11,600 years old \u2014 dating back to many millennia before Latin America's great tribal empires. If this age is confirmed, it will be the oldest directly dated skeleton found in the Americas. \u201cWhen I was diving and first saw it, I couldn't believe it,\u201d says Arturo Gonz\u00e1lez Gonz\u00e1lez, general director of the Museum of the Desert in Saltillo, Mexico. \u201cI felt sure the bones were very old.\u201d The cave skeleton may provide researchers with an insight into the origins of native American peoples, but it also symbolizes a new era in Mexican palaeoanthropology. For more than a century, the jungle-shrouded edifices of the Maya, Aztec or Olmec peoples have been the primary focus of anthropological research in Mexico. Probing these temples and tombs, some of which date back more than 3,000 years, is a scientific cottage industry and regularly sees foreign scientists troop to the various sites like tourists. But in recent years, a growing group of Mexican scientists has begun to focus on a much earlier period \u2014 when the land now called Mexico was the crossroads for the first inhabitants of the Americas as they traversed the continents. These scientists are only now scrutinizing Mexico's vast and largely unstudied collection of skeletons, which could be anything from 100 years to tens of thousands of years old. And they are exploring new sites, some of them underwater, from Yucat\u00e1n to the tip of the Baja California peninsula. The growth in local knowledge, expertise and resources is helping to solve some mysteries \u2014 and to uncover new ones \u2014 about who populated the Americas, and when. \n               Out of Asia \n             The prevailing theory is that most modern native American groups are descended from several waves of people who migrated from northern Asia between 14,000 and 10,000 years ago, crossing into America over a land bridge at the Bering Strait. Although the details of these migrations are not fully understood, it is known that a group called the Clovis people had made it to the southwestern United States by 11,500 years ago, travelling south as the ice that had gripped the north American continent slowly receded at the end of an ice age. But this cannot be the whole story. Archaeological remains indicate that there were people living in Monte Verde, Chile, at least 12,500 years ago \u2014 thousands of years before anyone could have travelled down through the middle of an ice-bound continent. Some of those who came over the Bering Strait may have travelled down the coast to reach the south more rapidly, and researchers continue to look for evidence of this coastal migration 1 . Another wave of people may have arrived at California directly from southern Asia and the Pacific islands by boat, and worked their way south from there. Some remains have hinted that modern groups of native Americans may have descended from these people as well as from the northern Asian immigrants 2 , 3 . But finding the evidence to support these theories isn't easy. In South America, archaeologists have mainly found signs of habitation, such as ancient campfires, rather than skeletons, making it impossible to work out where these early people came from. And in North America, most if not all of the skeletons studied seem to come from northern Asia \u2014 as would be expected, as Pacific Rim immigrants are not likely to have wandered north into chillier climes from their landing sites. Sandwiched between the two continents, Mexico may hold the much-needed evidence to clarify the origins of America's first inhabitants. \n               Body of evidence \n             Since the nineteenth century, Mexico has been collecting and storing skeletons of possible interest at the National Museum of Anthropology in Mexico City. This collection has quietly grown in the basement to some 25,000 specimens. Among the skeletons are dozens of specimens that could open new chapters about the peopling of the Americas. But these bones have so far languished in cardboard boxes, waiting for the day that local scientists have the training, access to technology and money to conduct proper research on them. To a great extent, that time has now arrived. Mexico's steady scientific development over recent years has given birth to a generation of researchers ready, willing and able to tackle those collections. But in many cases, they are still sorely lacking funds. Richer nations have government agencies to fund such research projects. And for more than a century, wealthy US or European philanthropists have paid for digs at home and abroad. Researchers in a developing nation such as Mexico don't have many governmental or philanthropic options; they must scramble for every peso. Some local researchers have looked for funding from media outlets, be it  National Geographic  or the Discovery Channel. Others \u2014 including Gonz\u00e1lez \u2014 have had to resort to promoting off-road vehicles to win funds for their work. In exchange for cash, Gonz\u00e1lez puts pictures of Dodge trucks in his slide presentations at conferences. They may have their money worries, but there is one thing Gonz\u00e1lez and his colleagues don't have to cope with. Unlike the United States, Mexico sees very little conflict between researchers and indigenous peoples when it comes to research on human remains. Native American tribes have delayed or halted US genetic studies of early skeletons \u2014 including the famous Kennewick man, a 9,000-year-old human skeleton found in Washington state in the 1990s \u2014 as they say that such studies would violate their notions of respect for the dead. In Mexico, the museums and their operations are seen as encompassing all peoples, whether they are indigenous or progeny of natives and Spanish conquerors. Today's population, mainly of mixed origins, has no strong feelings about the treatment of these bones. For the moment, this relatively relaxed attitude is encouraging US researchers to head south. \n               Ancestral ties \n             These growing links are also seeing more Mexican researchers collaborate with teams outside the country, which in turn is helping to bolster the nation's skills base. Last November, Alejandro Terrazas Mata, a physical anthropologist at the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) in Mexico City, began a winter field season in Ethiopia \u2014 home to some of the most important specimens showing man's evolution from primate and journey out of Africa. There he worked with a team headed by Tim White, a palaeoanthropologist from the University of California, Berkeley. \u201cWe are hoping to transplant some of the remote-sensing and fieldwork methods we've used successfully in Africa to assist Mexican palaeoanthropologists,\u201d says White. For Terrazas, it was an opportunity to learn how to do fieldwork in the hotbed of anthropology. \u201cThis is a dream of a lifetime,\u201d he says. Silvia Gonzalez (no relation to Arturo), a geoarchaeologist trained in Mexico City and Germany and now at Liverpool John Moores University in Britain, has also found useful collaborations. Although a rising star in her field back home, she has had to scramble for funds. Fortunately, she managed to secure sufficient cash in Britain to continue her work, and now has a $60,000 grant from Britain's Natural Environment Research Council to study specimens in her homeland, with an emphasis on the interaction between ancient peoples and climate. Although the grant is modest, Gonzalez says that it has attracted collaborations with colleagues from the University of Oxford and the University of Bristol, along with countrymen from Mexico's National Institute of Anthropology and History in Mexico City and other institutions. One of the most exciting studies in Mexico's anthropology labs today involves the comparison of ancient and modern bones with those of the Peric\u00fa \u2014 a tribe that lived near the tip of Baja California from about 2,500 years ago until the late 1800s. The Peric\u00fa lived in the hot, harsh desert of Baja in apparent isolation from other humans, surviving on sea life and cacti. The tribe was only discovered by researchers in the late 1940s, and has been a subject of much interest ever since. Last year, a team of Argentine, Spanish and Mexican researchers published a study of the shape of 33 Peric\u00fa skulls found in museum collections 2 , 3 . The skulls are long and narrow \u2014 similar to skulls in south Asia and the Pacific Rim, and not much like the more rounded skulls typical in northern Asia. This implied that some modern peoples may have evolved from an early wave of Australasian migrants, whereas many had assumed that all descendants had been from the later Asian migrations. \n               Pacific links \n             This theory captured the imagination of scientists and the public alike, with press headlines proclaiming that Aboriginals from islands off southeastern Asia had founded America. Interest was further inflamed when the media ran a story saying that preliminary DNA tests showed that the Peric\u00fa were related to the Maori, a tribe from the Pacific islands. But, at a symposium in Mexico City last September, Phillip Endicott, a PhD student at the Henry Wellcome Ancient Biomolecules Centre at the University of Oxford, UK, revealed that the Peric\u00fa DNA matched modern native Americans of north Asian descent. A lone DNA sample reflecting Maori genes could not be replicated, he said, indicating it was probably a contamination from other tests he was performing on Maori samples in the same lab. Although the team's early expectations of a link between the Peric\u00fa and the Maori were dashed, the DNA results posed an even more interesting question: if they're not genetically different, why do the Peric\u00fa have skull shapes so different from those of other natives of North America? The Mexican researchers and their colleagues are now exploring a promising hypothesis: over generations, the skulls of the Peric\u00fa may have become elongated because the tribe used their teeth as tools for net or fishing-line work. Graduate students at the Autonomous University of Baja California Sur in La Paz are now examining the teeth closely for signs of wear in an attempt to help corroborate this theory. But if this idea gains support, it will throw up a fresh problem. For the Peric\u00fa it will mean that DNA tests now contradict a study based on skull shape that made it into the pages of  Nature 3 . \u201cThis could have very profound implications,\u201d says Silvia Gonzalez, as it would cast doubt on all past and future work using skull shape alone to make decisions about a skeleton's ancestry. Without supporting evidence from DNA, such decisions could well be wrong, she says. To draw any firm conclusions about possible Australasian immigrants to early America, far more bones will need to be analysed. So that is what Silvia Gonzalez's group is doing now. Team-member Alfonso Rosales L\u00f3pez and his colleagues at the National Institute of Anthropology and History Museum in La Paz have been collecting Peric\u00fa specimens from rock shelters, cave floors or coastal shell middens for more than a dozen years. The collection is so substantial that even some of the more extraordinary finds \u2014 including a skull where the back half was cleanly cut off by a blow from something like a machete \u2014 have not yet been scientifically described. The skull slice is now being studied as possible evidence of cannibalism or some kind of ritual. Although Rosales L\u00f3pez is a co-author of a book on the Peric\u00fa culture 4 , his publications have been limited because of monetary and language barriers. That is changing now, thanks to Gonzalez's funding and her help with translation. Meanwhile, researchers are hot on the trail of much older skeletons to investigate similar questions. Among the most anticipated results is evidence from DNA extracted from \u2018Pe\u00f1on woman\u2019. Found in 1959 near the airport outside Mexico City, this skull has been dated to 10,755 years ago 5 . And its DNA is the oldest sample yet extracted from a skeleton in the Americas. Endicott is now analysing DNA from Pe\u00f1on woman. He declined to discuss his results until they are published or presented at a conference. Arturo Gonz\u00e1lez is also on the lookout for more specimens from the watery caves of the Yucat\u00e1n, searching for ancient bones that may yield DNA. Many of the bones he has studied so far were found by recreational divers, who spotted them while exploring the kilometre-long networks of caverns. Amid the remains of camels and elephants that died off during an ice age some 12,000 years ago, they have found some of America's earliest inhabitants. Gonz\u00e1lez is slowly retrieving these bones for study, and sharing the results with local colleagues at conferences such as last September's symposium in Mexico City. Determining the age of skeletons after millennia under water \u201cis a mess\u201d, acknowledges Ervin Taylor, an expert in dating techniques at the University of California, Riverside. But DNA left in the watery bones of the skeleton from Yucat\u00e1n so far hints at a date at least 11,600 years old, he notes \u2014 if not older. To be sure, \u201cI need more bone\u201d, Taylor says. Arturo Gonz\u00e1lez is ready to secure those specimens. He is heading into the caves this spring to follow up new hints of specimens, bones that he hopes will provide sufficient DNA for this new chapter in genetic testing. Together, Mexican scientists are at last pulling skeletons from cardboard boxes, the dusty recesses of museums and watery graves into the light of scientific study. \n                     http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/425023a \n                   \n                     http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/422010a \n                   \n                     http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/news040906-5 \n                   \n                     National Museum of Anthropology, Mexico City \n                   \n                     Silvia Gonzalez \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},
{"file_id": "433452a", "url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/433452a", "year": 2005, "authors": [{"name": "Ehsan Masood"}], "parsed_as_year": "2006_or_before", "body": "Pakistan's traditional ways have blocked many women's careers in science. But, as Ehsan Masood discovers, women are now fighting for their rights, both in life and in research. \u201cWhen I was doing my PhD, my husband and children would come to the department if I wanted to stay after 9 p.m.,\u201d recalls Zahida Maqsood, a professor of chemistry at the University of Karachi. This wasn't just to keep her company; nor to hassle her to come home and cook. In most Pakistani families, women are simply not allowed to work late alone, or to socialize after work with male colleagues. Even today, some 25 years since Maqsood's graduation, things are much the same. \u201cIf my students want to stay late, their families come and wait for them outside on the lawn,\u201d says Shakeel Farooqi, assistant professor of genetics at Karachi. But the winds of change are beginning to stir. Secular women's liberation movements have had very little impact in Pakistan. But the country, like many predominantly Muslim states, is witnessing the birth of Islamic feminism, in which women are demanding rights that they say Islam accords to them. It is being fuelled in part by more women going to schools and universities, and also by a generation of women evangelists such as Farhat Hashmi, founder of the worldwide Al-Huda International Welfare Foundation, which teaches women about Islam. Hashmi's lectures draw crowds of up to 10,000 women. \n               Employment rights \n              The effects are being felt throughout the country \u2014 including in its labs. Chemist Shazia Anjum, for example, is using her Muslim marriage contract to ensure that her science career moves forward. When she married she insisted upon a \u2018right to work\u2019 clause that would prevent her husband or his family from stopping her getting a job. Such legally binding, bespoke clauses are allowed in Muslim marriages, and can be inserted by the bride or groom; a woman may ask to be paid for her housework, for example. But a combination of low levels of female literacy and established social conventions mean that few of Pakistan's women are aware of these rights. Even fewer would think of using them. For Anjum, it has made possible her assistant professorship in chemistry at the International Centre for Chemical Sciences at the University of Karachi. Some, including a former head of Pakistan's Medical Research Council, claim to have had even fewer problems advancing their professional lives. Tasleem Akhtar comes from the North-West Frontier province, which is governed by an alliance of Islamic parties and is better known in the West for its role in nurturing the Taliban. Yet she still made it to the top job in medical research without, as she puts it, \u201cneeding to play golf with the minister for health\u201d. She claims never to have felt the cold pressure of a glass ceiling; nor did she find opposition from within her own family. \u201cI was allowed to study in the United Kingdom, no problem,\u201d she says. \u201cInstead of being forced to marry, daughters from poor families are often encouraged to get an education and earn a living for the rest of the family. It is in lower- and upper-middle-class families where you find the pressure to marry instead.\u201d Although Anjum and Akhtar's experiences are a sign of changing times, many cultural barriers remain. Women rarely live alone in Pakistan, unless they are widowed or divorced. Most live instead in extended families, in which parents, husbands and brothers often have the final say in decisions affecting their lives. Women cannot apply for a university place, a public-sector job or even a passport without completing a section on an application form that asks them for details of their father or husband. Most are forbidden by families to travel long distances without a male escort. Few drive cars beyond the limits of a handful of large cities and none ride bicycles or motorbikes on public roads. Women cannot marry without the written consent of a male, usually their father. \n               Liberal attitude \n             This kind of life may look painfully restrictive to Western eyes, but women's rights is now a cause with top-level backing from no less than President Pervez Musharraf and the chairman of Pakistan's Higher Education Commission, Atta-ur-Rahman, who was Anjum's PhD supervisor. Some of this support comes in the form of minor initiatives, such as encouraging higher-education institutions to provide women-only transport to ferry them safely home late at night. Other actions are much more significant. Musharraf, for example, has piloted a new law that formally recognizes \u2018honour killings\u2019 as a crime in their own right \u2014 punishable by death or life imprisonment. The killings, in which families in some rural areas punish women with death if, for example, they marry without permission or have premarital sex, results in about 1,000 deaths every year. The statistics for girls in schools and universities are also improving. In 1991, women accounted for one in five of the 60,000 students in the country's public universities. By 2001, their numbers had reached a third of the student population of 118,000. Pakistan's overall efforts in science are on the increase, too. The country's military dictatorships have historically been more generous to scientists than civilian administrations have been, and the Musharraf regime is no different. Science spending has multiplied 60-fold since 1999 and a major programme is under way to upgrade laboratories and boost the numbers of PhDs (see  Nature   432 , 273\u2013274; 2004 ).  The results of these changes can be seen at the universities in Pakistan's larger cities. At the Usman Institute of Technology in Karachi, a dozen researchers \u2014 male and female, young and old \u2014 gather to discuss these developments, and how women can make their voices heard in science. Anjum attends, dressed in what has become the international uniform of Muslim feminism: a long, loose-fitting coat and  hijab , the scarf that covers hair and head. But she is silent at the beginning of the two-hour meeting. Girls from most Pakistani households are mostly not encouraged to voice opinions in public; in addition, a tradition of deference and respect for older people means that they are unlikely to disagree with the views of senior colleagues present around the table. The ice only really beings to melt when the group gets on to the question of women needing the permission of a male relative to stay late in the lab. Most of the women acknowledge that they cannot work late without the consent of their parents, husbands or in-laws. The men nod in agreement. \n               Solo projects \n             Such attitudes present a significant obstacle to researchers working in rural or remote parts of the country. These places may provide a gold-mine of unexplored opportunities for research in areas such as geology and geophysics, hydrology and biological diversity. But university research managers are wary of assigning such projects to women. For this reason, says Nayyer Alam Zaigham, a geologist at the University of Karachi, his department has produced just one female PhD in seismology in the past 50 years. \u201cIn North America or Europe, you may be able to travel alone,\u201d he says. \u201cBut in my country, women have to be accompanied. It's a social thing. I cannot send women out to remote areas on their own. I cannot always go with them. And I cannot always arrange an escort. This is a big problem.\u201d  Quddusi Kazmi, director of the Marine Reference Collection at the University of Karachi, has plenty of experience of men telling her what she can and cannot do. When she was a student contemplating a research career in marine zoology, she says, one of her professors told her: \u201cWe can't allow a lady to do marine zoology. You have to go to the field. You have to go to the sea at odd times. Will your parents allow this?\u201d Kazmi got her degree anyway, although she says that she will never be allowed to learn how to swim or dive to assist her research. Bathing in public is considered immodest for women, and publicly funded women-only swimming does not exist anywhere in Karachi, she says. While she was doing her degree, collecting specimens meant wading out to sea at low tide and rushing back to shore before the tide came in. \u201cWe would feel awkward,\u201d she recalls. \u201cPeople would stare at us as if we were animals.\u201d These days, she has to hire fieldmen to do the actual collection. The good news is that the percentage of female university lecturers has been steadily rising \u2014 from 13% in 1990 to 24% in 2002. The female student population of the two largest universities is high: 67% in Karachi and 50% at the University of the Punjab. Even at universities in the more rural provinces of Sindh and Balochistan, one third of the students are women. It will be tough to get women into an equal position in the lab, admits Rahman. From their earliest years, men and women are discouraged from mixing, he notes. Even in public places, men and women automatically line up in separate queues, and public transport tends to be segregated. But Rahman is convinced that mixed labs are better for research. Having women work alongside men, he says, leads to obvious improvements in the atmosphere of a lab or research institution. \u201cIt does a lot of good. We find that men behave better, dress better and are more punctual,\u201d he says. Rahman's director of public relations, Mamoona Amjed, who is sitting in on the interview, breaks into a laugh when she hears this and asks jokingly whether the comment applies to the minister himself. The fact that a Pakistani female civil servant (admittedly, a senior one) can tease a minister in the presence of a journalist is a small sign, perhaps, that life for tomorrow's women may be easier than for those of yesterday. \n                     http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/nj6963-210a \n                   \n                     http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/nm0204-114 \n                   \n                     http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/35068702 \n                   \n                     'One woman is enough...' \n                   \n                     www.nature.com/nature/debates/women/women_contents.html \n                   \n                     Pakistan Science Foundation \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},
{"file_id": "433350a", "url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/433350a", "year": 2005, "authors": [{"name": "Quirin Schiermeier"}], "parsed_as_year": "2006_or_before", "body": "Quirin Schiermeier travels to Sri Lanka with a team of scientists in the wake of last month's tsunami. Together with locals they search through the damage for clues of where the wave hit hardest. It was 8:45 on a tropical December morning when Mohamed Nazfer saw the tsunami coming. He remembers the time exactly because he was eating breakfast, listening to the news on the radio. When he heard screaming in the street outside his house on the beachfront of Kalmunai, a fishing village on the east coast of Sri Lanka, he walked a few steps towards the beach to see what all the fuss was about. Then he began to run, fast, from the white wall of water hurtling towards him. Although the 35-year-old fisherman survived the Indian Ocean tsunami, his home, livelihood, wife, ten relatives and some 6,000 other people here and in neighbouring communities did not. Sometimes, Nazfer tells me as we stand among the wreckage, he thinks that he would be better off dead. He lives in a refugee camp now, a short distance inland, but he comes down every day to roam the remnants of his home. He remembers hearing somewhere that the waves were triggered by an earthquake 1,500 kilometres away, but he doesn't much care about the science behind the disaster. \u201cIt was God,\u201d he says. For the scientists who have spent their lives researching the physics of tsunamis, however, there is great reason to care. Philip Liu, a fluid dynamicist and tsunami expert at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, is one such person. In the aftermath of the disaster, he could be found hastily organizing an expedition to Sri Lanka. He and his team wanted to measure the traces that the flood had left on the soil, vegetation and structures in the \u2018inundation zone\u2019. I joined the ten-strong group of coastal engineers, geologists and fluid mechanics from the United States, New Zealand and Sri Lanka as they set out to collect data to determine the height, velocity and extent of the flood at different stretches of the coast. With additional, more detailed information about the local topography and the near-shore ocean depths, they hope to improve numerical tsunami models, and to produce physical maps that local planners can use when rebuilding settlements, hotels and infrastructure. Those same maps could also be used to plan better evacuation routes, and to save lives. The 26 December tsunami was the first to strike Sri Lanka in living memory. Across the Indian Ocean, tsunamis are rare but not unknown. In June 1994, a tsunami killed some 200 coastal residents in east Java, after an earthquake occurred off the coast. Waves were reported to have been as high as 15 metres. No one knows for sure, but it has been estimated that large tsunamis may hit this part of the world once every 1,000 years. The recent tsunami was one of the world's worst natural disasters in decades. About 33,000 people, almost half of whom were children, died on Sri Lanka's east and south coasts alone. The death toll around the entire Indian Ocean region exceeds 220,000, and numbers are still rising. Although other earthquakes, such as that in Tangshan, China, in 1976, have taken hundreds of thousands of lives, no single incident has had such a devastating effect on so many countries for a long time \u2014 and certainly not with the overriding feeling that something could have been done to save many of the victims. Early warning systems against tsunamis do exist, but at present only for the Pacific region, where the waves occur much more frequently (see  page 343 ). The information about this wave took hours to reach the people who could have acted (see Timeline,  Figure 1  ). \n               Tough challenge \n             Researchers such as Liu know that their efforts should ultimately help improve the warning systems. But collecting the necessary information is no easy task. Liu's expedition on 10\u201315 January proved to be a first-rate logistical challenge. Plans and schedules had to be changed on a daily basis, as roads proved impassable, bridges were destroyed and hotels closed. But thanks to the team's improvisational skills and much support from the Sri Lankan military, who acted as hosts, it did provide a wealth of data. Once in Sri Lanka, Liu's team split in two \u2014 with journalists in tow. One group, including Liu and myself, set off on 10 January from Colombo to Trincomalee, a small town on the east coast. From there, we headed south, visiting affected coastlines down to Amparai, a former stronghold of the Tamil rebels. A second team, led by Costas Synolakis, a civil engineer and tsunami expert at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles, surveyed the better-developed south coast of the island. The destruction became increasingly severe the farther south we travelled, often with seemingly random differences in effects from one beach to another. The 50,000-strong town of Trincomalee suffered comparatively modest damage, but the small communities on the neighbouring Koddiyar Bay were hit hard. South of Batticaloa things deteriorated rapidly, until finally we came to the shocking sight of Kalmunai. Here, the clean-up had just begun, and the smell of decay still lingered in the air \u2014 when we arrived some local volunteers had just buried a human head on the beach. \u201cIt is a conflicting experience for me to go to the field amid all this devastation,\u201d admits Bruce Jaffe, a geological oceanographer with the Pacific Science Center in Santa Cruz, California. \u201cIn a way it makes you feel guilty. But then these data are really invaluable for better assessing the hazard and frequency of tsunamis.\u201d On each beach, Jaffe scanned the ground, the rooftops and even empty swimming pools for sediment deposits left behind by the wave. He also recorded signs of the erosion that the rushing water seemed to have caused hundreds of metres inland. He took sand samples from different sediment layers and packed them in hundreds of carefully labelled plastic bags for analysis back in the lab. From the thickness of the deposits and the distribution of grain size in the tsunami-generated layers, he will later use computer models to back-calculate the number of incoming waves, the flow velocities and water heights at every probed location. \n               Sifting the clues \n             \u201cPost-tsunami surveys help us define what kind of resolution we need in our simulations,\u201d says Synolakis, who has taken part in 12 such field trips since 1992. As well as Jaffe's approach of looking at grain size, others hope to use different measures to test and calibrate their models. Physicists such as Liu tend to use evidence of high-water marks to back-calculate wave heights and speeds. He and his colleagues used visual clues to determine the direction of the incoming flow on Sri Lankan beaches. Local children, who crowded round us and tried to steal the tools from our hands, helped to seek out buildings with clear water lines and posed for pictures. Despite the tragedy of last month, they were intensely curious and keen to help. Between the daily forays onto the beaches, the researchers spent hours in the car, with laptops bouncing on their knees, debating the specifics of this wave. Tsunami research is done by a small community: no more than 200 scientists worldwide specialize in the field, says Liu. And many of them are now scouring the beaches of Sri Lanka, Indonesia and the other countries hit by the wave. Late into the night, members of our team animatedly discussed what the wave looked like at birth, and how it propagated across the Indian Ocean. The mechanism by which tsunamis form is relatively simple (see Graphic,  Figure 2  ). And the equations that describe their rough characteristics, such as speed and wave height, in deep water are similarly straightforward. But there are complexities that are far more difficult to deal with. December's tsunami was caused when an underwater fault line ruptured across hundreds of kilometres \u2014 and no one is sure what a wave formed in this way actually looks like. \n               Rapid rise \n             Most of the experts agree that a tsunami is initially shaped like an \u2018N\u2019, with a large crest and trough (see \u2018During the quake\u2019,  Fig. 2  ), before evolving into more complicated shapes. If the trough of the wave travels ahead, as it seems to have done towards Indonesia, the ocean recedes from the shore line before the wave crest arrives. This phenomenon led many eyewitnesses of the tsunami to wander down to the beach out of curiosity \u2014 leaving them little or no time to escape the full force of the incoming wave. After birth, a tsunami propagates in deep water with stunning speed but with a low wave height. In this case, the wave moved at about 800 kilometres per hour. Models put the maximum wave height to the east of Sri Lanka at more than a metre (see Map,  Figure 3  ), whereas satellites measured up to 80 centimetres. Aboard a ship, such waves would be hardly perceptible. The small size also means it is extremely difficult to detect tsunamis from the air or with buoys that measure variations in water pressure. Filtering out the loud \u2018noise\u2019 from normal wind-generated waves on top of a long tsunami hump requires sophisticated equations. It took hours to process and analyse the data gathered by satellite for the December wave. Such systems are not designed for, nor suitable for, warnings \u2014 by the time the results were ready the tsunami had already struck. Once tsunami waves reach shallow water, they transform dramatically. Because the speed of a tsunami is a function of the water depth, it slows as it nears the shore. But because its energy remains almost constant, the height of the wave grows tremendously in shallow water. On our trip, we saw one 5-metre-high building that had been completely submerged. Reefs, bays and undersea features such as canyons all play a role in modifying the wave, buffering or focusing its energy, or changing its direction. Reflected waves interact with each other. And the steeper the sub-sea slope, the more quickly the wave grows and the more energy it retains when it hits land. This aspect of a tsunami's journey is incredibly difficult to model. \u201cThings start to get really complex once the waves hit the shore and continue to flow on land,\u201d says Liu. Topography, land material, friction and numerous small-scale features from trees to houses come into play \u2014 creating a modelling nightmare. Attempts to describe the breaking, turbulence and debris pick-up of a tsunami on land are still very crude and need a lot of development, says Patrick Lynett, a coastal modeller at Texas A&M University in College Station, who has modelled the 1998 Papua New Guinea tsunami 1 . \u201cComparison with the real thing is of paramount importance,\u201d he says. A tsunami's final surge onto land rarely resembles the towering waves often drawn by artists. The waves rarely \u2018break\u2019 the way that surfing waves do. Rather the water simply rushes inland, often preceded by a \u2018bore\u2019 \u2014 a mass of extremely turbulent white water. What such a bore looks like exactly was also a matter for midnight debates on this trip \u2014 not one of the tsunami researchers has actually seen an incoming tsunami. Instead, fluid dynamicists study the propagation and transformation of waves under simplified laboratory conditions, using large water tanks equipped with wave-making mechanisms and advanced optical-measurement technology. \n               A rush and a push \n             The resulting mathematical equations are then marshalled to create computer-generated tsunamis, using software such as the Tunami-N2. This standard model was designed in the early 1990s by Nobuo Shuto, a modelling expert at Tohoku University's Disaster Control Research Center in Sendai, Japan, to calculate wave physics up to a shoreline. With a similar model \u2014 the Cornell Multigrid Coupled Tsunami model \u2014 Liu has simulated the propagation and wave evolution of the Indian Ocean tsunami. But these models have limitations. They are based on an idealized ocean floor, and on untested assumptions made about the seismic generation of tsunamis in the source region. Such lab waves are not made by anything approaching a rupturing fault. And there are issues about how water behaves on different scales that cannot be resolved in a lab model. Real-life tsunamis consistently catch these models out. A wave that hit the Indonesian island of Flores in 1992, for example, defied standard models. To explain its behaviour, Liu had to create a more detailed simulation 2 , which showed that the tsunami could bend around corners and penetrate into sheltered coastal areas without losing its energy. The accuracy of models has improved considerably during the past decade, says Synolakis. \u201cAt the time of the 1992 Nicaragua tsunami, models underestimated the observed flooding by a factor of ten,\u201d he says. \u201cSince then, the difference between models and measurements has diminished to around a factor of two.\u201d Preliminary data suggest that this time the models may have done even better. Vasily Titov, a former student of Synolakis, now at the Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory in Seattle, Washington, used a model 3  that simulates how a tsunami wave penetrates inland. The results seem to agree with measurements made so far to within 30%. To close that gap further, the researchers will continue to collect data. They are also pressing for more accurate maps of the sea floor around Sri Lanka. At a concluding meeting on 15 January in Colombo, Sri Lankan navy officials said that they would provide high-resolution maps of the sea floor immediately, and help to collect any missing information. Eventually, says Synolakis, it might be possible to produce inundation maps of threatened coastlines in Sri Lanka, showing how far water is likely to intrude inland under various threats. Such maps currently exist only for some coastal areas in Japan and the United States. The results are unlikely to persuade fishermen to move inland, he concedes, but they will help town planners to rebuild destroyed schools, hospitals and tourist infrastructure at secure locations. \n               Structurally unsound \n             The information can't come soon enough: at many places reconstruction has already begun, but is often substandard. Many builders are using bad, crumbling concrete and little steel to reinforce the structures \u2014 much like most of the buildings that were destroyed by the wave. \u201cSome hastily rebuilt constructions look like they may collapse without a tsunami,\u201d says Synolakis. The geological work being done by Jaffe's team will also help planners to assess the risk of future events. By digging deeper into coastlines or marshes, where sediments have been preserved for thousands of years, Jaffe hopes to show how often large tsunamis have occurred in this region \u2014 a method that has previously worked for Papua New Guinea and the west coast of the United States 4 . A mythological account in the  Mahavansa , Sri Lanka's national Buddhist chronicle, suggests that a tsunami may have hit the island around 150  BC . This book reports that \u201cthe sea flooded the land, as a punishment by God\u201d, says Starin Fernando, a geologist at Sri Lanka's Geological Survey and Mines Bureau in Colombo. Using Jaffe's methods, Fernando is hoping to find geological evidence for this religious tale. Such work may reaffirm that tsunamis in this area are extremely rare. But the lessons learned about modelling by Liu and his team will have far wider implications. They now have reams of valuable data that will improve models of how tsunamis behave near shore and on land. And next time, they hope, all this information will help to curtail the extent of any disaster. \n               For more on the tsunami visit: \n             \n               http://www.nature.com/news/specials/tsunami \n             \n                     http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/news050103-6 \n                   \n                     http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/news050110-10 \n                   \n                     http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/425649a \n                   \n                     Tsunami in focus \n                   \n                     Tsunami special \n                   \n                     Pacific Marine Environment Laboratory \n                   \n                     Pacific Tsunami Warning Center \n                   \n                     USGS: life of a tsunami \n                   Reprints and Permissions"}
