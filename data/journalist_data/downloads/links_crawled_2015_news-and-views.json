It was when they put together their lists of successive kings or priests that these ancient peoples acquired their first impressions of the tremendous stretch of time behind them. The ancient Greeks had very defective lists and thought that only a comparatively short period separated them from the age when the gods had walked and sported about on the Earth. But some of them learned about the huge lists of Egyptian priests and came to realize that there had been thousands of years of human history before their day.

Heeney"}], "parsed_as_year": "2006_or_before", "body": "West Africa's Ebola epidemic continues to reveal surprises. Although the animal species that originally passed the virus to people remains a mystery, a virus reservoir and persistent disease have been identified in some human survivors. Animals are reservoirs for many pathogens that occasionally jump species and infect humans. In December 2013 in the forests of Guinea, a two-year-old boy became infected with the Zaire strain of Ebola virus from an unidentified animal source 1 . This event triggered the largest and longest human epidemic of Ebola viral infection in recorded history. Across several countries in West Africa, over 28,000 people were infected and more than 11,000 died. This fatality rate of less than 50% was lower than in most previous outbreaks, and it left more than 16,000 survivors 2 . Studies of these survivors are changing our understanding of Ebola virus infection and raising concern for the long-term well-being of these individuals and their communities. Writing in the  New England Journal of Medicine , Deen  et al . 3  reveal that Ebola virus RNA can persist in the semen of men for months after their recovery from the disease, and Mate  et al . 4  demonstrate that such persistence can be the source of new infections through sexual transmission. Deen and colleagues obtained semen samples from 93 Sierra Leonian men who had survived Ebola virus disease (EVD) at various intervals after the onset of their disease. Although the authors find that the proportion of men whose semen contained Ebola virus RNA waned with time, the viral genomes persisted for as long as 7\u20139 months after recovery. Mate and colleagues provide convincing evidence that a female patient in Liberia, who subsequently died, had contracted Ebola virus through unprotected vaginal intercourse with her male partner, who had survived EVD. These observations support similar findings in previous epidemics of filoviruses, the virus family to which Ebola belongs. There have been reports 5 , 6  of the persistence of Marburg virus in the anterior chamber of the eye and semen of human survivors, and of the persistence of Ebola virus in the semen of men who survived the 1995 outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo 7 . This has obvious implications for sexual partners. The fact that Ebola virus is found at high levels in placental tissues also suggests that transmission could occur from pregnant women who survive EVD to their babies, although pregnant women who become infected usually abort the fetus before term 8 . Mother-to-child transmission by breastfeeding in survivors of Marburg virus has been reported 9 , and the potential for transmission through breast milk has also been suggested for Ebola 10 . Although the relative risk of virus transmission from survivors is low compared with transmission from patients with acute EVD, a single case of new infection is sufficient to trigger an epidemic ( Fig. 1 ). Thus, there is a strong need for rigorous assessment of the tissue reservoirs of Ebola in human survivors and the associated public-health risks. Follow-up health care should be combined with compassionate education of survivors and their communities by qualified and knowledgeable personnel, including advice on condom use. Another lesson to emerge from this epidemic is that some survivors experience symptoms after their recovery from the main disease episode, suggesting that viral persistence in certain compartments of the body is more serious in some survivors than previously recognized. Reported symptoms include blurred vision, pain behind the eyes, hearing deficits, painful swallowing, joint pain, fever, memory loss and difficulty in sleeping 11 , 12 . The rehospitalization of a British nurse who developed neurological complications more than 9 months after surviving acute EVD 13  is a chilling indication that the virus can persist in the central nervous system and be triggered to reactivate or to escape immune surveillance, or both. Fortunately, diagnosis and successful clinical intervention were possible for the nurse in Britain, but this situation is unlikely in most communities in West Africa. The existence of a reservoir state in human Ebola survivors is now beyond debate. But we do not know how long viable virus can persist in these tissue reservoirs, nor whether the virus replicates there at low levels or is dormant and then triggered to replicate. Better definition and understanding of the reservoirs and the underlying mechanisms of post-EVD symptoms are needed to inform clinical management and treatment. For example, studies of survivors may identify features of their immune responses (such as neutralizing-antibody determinants) that correlate with either full viral clearance or the persistence of viral reservoirs. Such correlates may enable survivors to be classified into 'carrier' or 'cleared' subtypes. Potential factors that could predispose survivors to viral re-emergence also need to be taken into account, including genetics, compromised immunity owing to poor health, concurrent infections such as HIV, or use of immunosuppressive drugs. However, Ebola, like other RNA viruses, may be prone to mutational changes, and virus escape from the host's immune response may eventually occur even without predisposing factors. It is also not clear how, or whether, post-EVD immunity is affected by the stage of treatment or type of therapy given, such as monoclonal antibodies or the antibodies in convalescent plasma. As well as helping to classify survivors, enhanced understanding of viral persistence will help to guide therapeutic choices \u2014 treatment with small antiviral molecules, for example, may facilitate full clearance of the virus. Although we are learning much about Ebola from this epidemic, we have yet to identify the events that caused the virus to jump to the Guinean boy almost two years ago. The consumption of bushmeat has been associated with previous epidemics, and some bushmeat species, such as great apes and forest antelopes, are susceptible to high levels of Ebola-virus replication and die from the infection. They are thus best considered as amplifying hosts, rather than the initial reservoir species ( Fig. 1 ). Prime suspects for the reservoir include several species of bat, although a bat source has not been confirmed for this latest epidemic 14 . Indeed, the animal reservoirs of Ebola may be cloaked by sequestration of the virus in much the same way as its persistence in human survivors, waiting for physiological triggers for transmission to unexposed animals of the same species or to amplifying hosts. Understanding the triggers of Ebola emergence, the persistence of the virus in humans and the infection dynamics in its animal reservoirs is vital not only for the long-term care of survivors of this epidemic, but also for preventing the next one.\n Footnote  1 Correspondence to\n                 Jonathan L.

Among the many practical problems concerned with such a project, apart from tunnelling and mechanical excavation in the high Alps, are the necessity to dredge the harbour at Trieste so that it can eventually accommodate oil tankers of 160,000 dead weight tons; setting storage tanks there on piles because available land is a rocky hill site; construction of several thousand feet of piers in the Adriatic ...

But on  page 559  of this issue, Lovelock  et al . (C. E. Lovelock  et al .

Walker"}], "parsed_as_year": "2006_or_before", "body": "People who died of the neurodegenerative condition Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease after treatment with cadaver-derived human growth hormone also developed some of the pathological traits of Alzheimer's disease.  See Letter  p.247 In the 1960s and '70s, researchers discovered that a rare but deadly human degenerative brain disorder called Creutzfeldt\u2013Jakob disease (CJD) could be transmitted experimentally to animals and, under unusual circumstances, to other humans 1 , 2 . Since then, some have speculated that other neurodegenerative diseases might also be transmissible 1 , 3 . On  page 247  of this issue, Jaunmuktane  et al . 4  present evidence indicating that changes in the brain that are characteristic of Alzheimer's disease have been transmitted between humans. Transmission probably occurred through injections of contaminated, cadaver-derived human growth hormone (c-hGH) that was extracted from pituitary glands collected at autopsy. Before 1985, an estimated 30,000 people \u2014 mostly children with growth deficiency \u2014 received injections of c-hGH (refs  2 , 5 ). To obtain sufficient quantities of hormone for treatment, thousands of pituitary glands (a tissue found at the base of the brain) were pooled and homogenized, and c-hGH was then chemically extracted ( Fig. 1 ). After disease incubation times ranging from 5 to more than 40 years, a small percentage of these people (up to 6.3%, according to country 2 ) developed CJD. We now know that the CJD-causing contaminant in the pituitary extracts was the prion, a normally produced protein that becomes infectious and toxic by adopting an abnormal shape that similarly corrupts other prion proteins. Another disease of protein misfolding \u2014 and the most prevalent form of dementia \u2014 is Alzheimer's disease 6 . The pathological hallmarks of the disease are insoluble aggregates of amyloid-\u03b2 protein (A\u03b2) called plaques, which form between neurons; A\u03b2 build-up in the blood vessels of the brain; and the abnormal deposition of tau protein in nerve cells (known as tauopathy). Several lines of evidence indicate that the misfolding and accumulation of A\u03b2 is an early driver of Alzheimer's disease, and that this process precedes the onset of dementia by well over a decade 6 . But whether every person with extensive brain A\u03b2 deposition will ultimately develop Alzheimer's disease is a focus of current research. It is known that A\u03b2 can aggregate in the brains of animals if their brains are injected with minute amounts of misfolded A\u03b2 proteins known as seeds 7 . This indicates that A\u03b2 deposition can be induced through a prion-like mechanism of corruptive protein templating 7 . By identifying a similar phenomenon in humans, Jaunmuktane and colleagues' study provides fresh support for this seeding concept in a clinically relevant setting. The authors describe the findings of autopsies on 8 people who died of CJD at between 36 and 51 years of age, having been treated with c-hGH approximately 30 years earlier. In addition to the neurodegenerative changes typical of CJD, four of the subjects showed extensive A\u03b2 deposition in the brain and two had sparse A\u03b2 deposits. Such Alzheimer's-like changes are extremely rare at such a young age, and were not found in patients up to a decade older who died of prion diseases that were unrelated to c-hGH treatment. The authors also showed that the c-hGH-treated subjects did not have any of the known genetic risk factors for Alzheimer's disease. Moreover, they confirmed a previous report 8  that A\u03b2 deposits occur in the pituitary glands of people with Alzheimer's disease, supporting the possibility that aggregates were induced by A\u03b2 seeds in the c-hGH. Although an observational study such as this cannot prove that the A\u03b2 deposits in the patients' brains were caused by A\u03b2 seeds, studies in genetically modified mice have established that aggregated A\u03b2 can behave like prions 7 , 9 . Strikingly, when A\u03b2 seeds were introduced into the abdomens of mice, rather than directly into the brain, A\u03b2 deposition was more prominent in cerebral blood vessels than in A\u03b2 plaques 10 . This finding mirrors the vascular A\u03b2 accumulation observed by Jaunmuktane  et al ., and reinforces the supposition that the A\u03b2 seeds in the affected people travelled to the brain from elsewhere in the body. How can future experiments strengthen the case for the prion-like seeding of A\u03b2 in humans and better assess its implications? The original c-hGH extracts, if available, should be assessed for the presence of A\u03b2 seeds using biochemical and animal-transmission experiments. Although age-matched control patients who died of prion disease had a much lower incidence of A\u03b2 deposits than did the patients who died of CJD following c-hGH treatment, there remains a possibility that CJD itself can precipitate Alzheimer's-like pathology 11 . Understanding the mechanisms by which these different disease processes interact in the brain could help to explain the frequent coexistence of multiple degenerative brain diseases in the elderly 7 . A\u03b2 seeds are long-lived in the brain, and may be even more resistant to degradation than are prions 12 . Given the build-up of A\u03b2 in the pituitary glands of people with Alzheimer's disease, and the relatively high prevalence of the disease in the general population, batches of c-hGH are more likely to have been contaminated by A\u03b2 seeds than by prions, which could mean that more recipients received injections containing A\u03b2 seeds. However, it is important to stress that the subjects of this study died of CJD, not of Alzheimer's disease. Whether those with A\u03b2 lesions would eventually have manifested clinical Alzheimer's disease cannot be known with certainty. Continued surveillance of surviving c-hGH recipients will be essential to determine whether they are at unusually high risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. An earlier study 8  suggests that, as of 2008, c-hGH-treated patients in the United States are not more likely to develop Alzheimer's disease than people in the general population, although an incubation period of 30 years or more is possible. Interestingly, the subjects in the current study lacked tauopathy, an essential feature of Alzheimer's disease 6 . Whether tauopathy would have emerged over a longer incubation period is unknown. This transmission of A\u03b2 pathology occurred in the uncommon context of long-term c-hGH therapy. So far, there is no indication that Alzheimer's disease can be transmitted between people under ordinary circumstances. Furthermore, the replacement of c-hGH by genetically engineered growth hormone has eliminated the risk that growth-hormone treatment will inadvertently transmit brain disorders between humans. However, it is conceivable that the human transmission of A\u03b2 seeds can occur under other conditions, which must now be carefully defined. Jaunmuktane and colleagues' findings should stimulate new research in this direction, and, more generally, will inspire further investigation into the mechanisms that govern the formation, transmissibility and toxicity of misfolded protein seeds in neurodegenerative diseases.\n Footnote  1 Correspondence to\n                 Mathias Jucker  or  Lary C.

Kennedy"}], "parsed_as_year": "2006_or_before", "body": "An RNA-interference screen has identified the protein CD55, expressed on the surface of red blood cells, as an essential receptor for infection of the cells by the malaria parasite  Plasmodium falciparum . There are trillions of cells in the human body and around 200 distinct cell types, some of which can be hijacked as safe houses by deadly pathogens. Malaria parasites, which infect millions of humans annually, have a preference for residing in liver and blood cells. To enter these cells, the parasites make proteins that recognize other proteins on the target cell's surface. By analogy, the parasite proteins fit in a key-like fashion to their locks, the red blood cell proteins. But only a handful of these lock-and-key combinations has been discovered. Writing in  Science , Egan  et al . 1  combine two exciting technologies \u2014 RNA interference and  ex vivo  production of red blood cells \u2014 to identify other receptor proteins involved in malaria-parasite entry. In 1975, live imaging of malaria parasites entering red blood cells highlighted a dynamic process with distinct observable steps 2 . The form of the malaria parasite that enters these cells is a merozoite, characterized by an ovoid shape and an apical tip. After initial contact with the red blood cell, the merozoite reorients so that its apical tip is in close proximity to the cell surface. Parasite proteins in the apical prominence recognize red blood cell proteins, triggering irreversible commitment to entry \u2014 turning the key in the lock and opening the door. Subsequently, a tight junction forms between parasite and red blood cell membranes, propelling the parasite into the cell and beginning the blood stage of infection. Intensive efforts to develop a vaccine against this stage have focused on identifying all the lock-and-key combinations involved in parasite invasion and on ways to block parasite entry. Egan  et al . have performed the first large knockdown screen of red blood cell proteins that are bound by the most lethal human malaria parasite,  Plasmodium falciparum . The researchers targeted 42 genes that encode proteins determining blood group, on the basis that all  P. falciparum  receptors known so far belong to this protein group and that these genes are not involved in red blood cell production ( Fig. 1 ). The authors inserted a library of small hairpin RNA molecules (shRNAs) that bind to, and thus inhibit expression of, these genes into isolated haematopoietic progenitor cells (which give rise to all blood cells), and then induced these cells to proliferate and differentiate into red blood cells. Once the cells were mature enough to sustain parasite development, they were infected with  P. falciparum  expressing green fluorescent protein, thus allowing infected cells to be identified. The authors then sequenced the shRNAs in these cells and compared the levels of each shRNA between infected and non-infected cell populations. Positive targets were identified as genes whose corresponding shRNAs were under-represented in the infected population, following the logic that inhibiting these genes impairs parasite infection. Among the authors' positive hits were genes encoding the proteins basigin and complement receptor 1 (CR1), which are known to be involved in  P. falciparum  invasion 3 , 4 . More excitingly, they identified the cell-surface protein CD55 as the top-ranked candidate for a new entry portal for  P. falciparum . A key aspect of this discovery is that CD55 is an essential lock in the invasion process: Egan and colleagues show that diverse  P. falciparum  laboratory strains and field isolates could not infect red blood cells lacking CD55. The parasite uses several lock-and-key combinations to enter red blood cells, to maximize its opportunities for entry 5 , and this redundancy presents a huge hurdle to the development of vaccines to block blood-stage infection. Therefore, interactions that are essential in the invasion process provide attractive vaccine candidates. The effect of loss of CD55 on parasite invasion is similar to the loss of basigin, whose parasite protein partner PfRh5 is a leading blood-stage vaccine candidate 6 . Clearly, an outstanding question stemming from this work is the identification of the  P. falciparum  protein that binds to CD55. If CD55 is a crucial host factor for  P. falciparum  invasion, the hypothesis would be that the parasite ligand is also an essential factor and thus warrants inclusion in the vaccine-development pipeline. Egan  et al . also show that loss of CD55 on red blood cells affects the proliferation of diverse  P. falciparum  strains. The authors suggest that CD55 may be involved in the irreversible-commitment phase of parasite invasion. This hypothesis should be further explored using live and high-resolution imaging of merozoites attempting to infect CD55-deficient red blood cells. It will be interesting to determine whether the loss of CD55 affects the establishment of commitment, deformation of the red blood cell surface or signalling for tight-junction formation during the early stages of parasite invasion. Could CD55 be a therapeutic target for malaria infections? Although some healthy humans exist without CD55 on their blood cells, important caveats arise for individuals living in malarious regions. Field studies show a correlation between declining CD55 levels on red blood cells and severe malarial anaemia, potentially due to the destruction of red blood cells by the complement system 7 , an arm of the immune system that is regulated by CD55. An alternative avenue could be to explore the potential of soluble CD55 as a competitor to red blood cell CD55 for merozoite binding, and thus an inhibitor of parasite growth. An emerging theme in  P. falciparum  invasion is that the parasite exploits complement regulators as entry receptors. In humans, CR1 and CD55 protect self-tissues from complement attack. A variable currently missing from experimental work monitoring  P. falciparum  invasion is the addition of active complement-system components during parasite entry. For example, complement activation is known to modulate the behaviour of both CD55 and CR1 on membranes, resulting in changes in red blood cell deformability that may affect merozoite entry 8 , 9 . Binding of parasite ligands to these receptors may interfere with their regulatory roles (as is the case with CR1), and the consequences of this for red blood cell survival during infection need to be understood. Current research has led to a remarkable deconstruction of the distinct steps in  P. falciparum  invasion 10 , but future challenges will be to understand merozoite entry in the context of complement activation and immune attack.

Wilkinson"}], "parsed_as_year": "2006_or_before", "body": "An intricate recursive RNA splicing mechanism that removes especially long introns (non-coding sequences) from genes has been found to be evolutionarily conserved and more prevalent than previously thought.  See Letters    p.371  &  p.376 One of the biggest surprises in molecular biology was the discovery in 1977 that coding information in genes is interrupted by non-coding sequences known as introns. Much has since been learned about how introns are recognized and spliced out of precursor RNA to yield mature messenger RNA in which the remaining sequences \u2014 the exons \u2014 are stitched together. A lingering challenge has been to work out the way in which long introns are correctly recognized and spliced out, because they have a greater potential for splicing errors than do short introns. One intriguing solution to this problem arrived 17 years ago, with the discovery that a long intron in the  Ultrabithorax  gene in the fruit fly  Drosophila melanogaster  is removed in a progressive, stepwise fashion, thereby reducing the size of the chunks that need to be defined for splicing 1 . However, subsequent studies identified only a handful of fly genes that undergo this 'recursive' splicing 2 , 3 , and no examples were demonstrated in other species 4 , casting doubt on the generality of the process. Two papers in this issue report that recursive splicing is actually quite widespread in fly genes 5  and that it is also used by genes expressed in the human brain 5 , 6 . Recursive splicing depends on juxtaposed 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 splice-site sequences, called recursive splice sites, in the middle of long introns ( Fig. 1a ). Duff  et al . 5  ( page 376 ) set out to identify recursive splice sites in  D. melanogaster  using deep-sequencing methods. Their screen yielded 197 functional recursive splice sites, many of which were highly conserved across several  Drosophila  strains. The authors identified a total of 115 fly genes that undergo recursive splicing, greatly expanding the range of this mechanism. By evaluating the spliced-out intron segments (lariats), Duff  et al . obtained evidence that recursive splicing is a sequential and largely obligate process for genes that have recursive splice sites. They also found that recursive 3\u2032 splice sites are typically richer in the long tracts of pyrimidines (the nucleotide bases cytosine and uracil) required for splicing than are non-recursive 3\u2032 splice sites. This raises the possibility that their splicing depends more than that of typical introns on the polypyrimidine-tract-binding protein U2AF. Indeed, the authors found that recursive splicing is strikingly more sensitive to U2AF depletion than is canonical splicing. The physiological significance of this intriguing discovery remains to be determined. Sibley  et al . 6  ( page 371 ) addressed the long-standing question of whether recursive splicing is evolutionarily conserved. Using two complementary approaches, they identified nine genes that undergo recursive splicing in the human brain. In contrast to sites in  Drosophila , in which the majority of recursive introns are completely spliced out 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , all recursive splice sites identified in humans harboured an 'RS exon' that seems to be pivotal for removing the long intron and can be retained in some circumstances ( Fig. 1b ). The authors identified two roles for the RS exon in recursive splicing in humans. First, it facilitates recognition of the recursive splicing site, presumably through the process of exon definition. This is a complex mechanism that defines splice sites on either side of an exon through recruitment of splicing-promoting proteins 7 . Second, it provides opportunities for quality control: RS exons are almost always spliced out of normal mRNAs, but the authors found that they are usually retained when the upstream exon is generated from an aberrant promoter sequence or from a potentially faulty splicing event. RS-exon inclusion is favoured in these instances because its 5\u2032 splice site drives splicing more effectively than the 5\u2032 splice site required to remove the RS exon. RS-exon retention often leads to death of the mRNA, because RS exons typically contain in-frame premature-termination codons \u2014 sequences that cause the mRNA to be degraded by the nonsense-mediated RNA decay (NMD) pathway 8  ( Fig. 1b ). This is physiologically relevant because most RS-exon-containing mRNAs are probably 'garbage' transcripts. But a subset of these mRNAs may be functional; their formation might be induced when NMD is repressed, such as during particular stages of development and in response to stress 8 . Why do humans and  Drosophila  seem to use different mechanisms to splice out recursive exons? Species-specific splicing factors may be one explanation. Alternatively, differential RS-exon usage might result from known differences in how these two species define splice sites 7 . It could also be that the differences in these two species seem greater than is actually the case \u2014 for example, RS exons might participate in an intermediate step of  Drosophila  recursive splicing, being included in mature RNAs so infrequently that they are usually undetectable. It was previously proposed that recursive splicing might increase the fidelity of splicing 1 , 2 , 3 . Sibley  et al . examined this possibility using antisense oligonucleotide molecules to block recursive splice sites. They found that this had no obvious effect on the recursive splicing of two human genes, and only modestly inhibited recursive splicing of a zebrafish gene. These data suggest that recursive splicing is not required for the efficiency or accuracy of long-intron splicing. It is possible, however, that this experiment did not reveal a crucial role of recursive splicing because blockade of the natural recursive splice site led to the use of other recursive splice sites that are not normally used. Duff  et al . performed extensive genome-wide analyses of  Drosophila  (35 dissected tissues, 24 cell lines and 30 developmental stages) and found that recursive splicing occurs in about 6% of long introns in all tissues tested. By contrast, recursive splicing may exhibit some tissue specificity in humans. Sibley  et al . found that genes with long introns tend to be expressed in the human nervous system, and they identified recursively spliced RNAs expressed in the human brain 6 . Duff  et al . detected some selectivity for recursive splicing in the brain in a screen of 20 human tissues (including fetal brain and adult cerebellum), but this may partly reflect the difficulty of detecting recursively spliced RNAs in tissues that express such RNAs at low levels. It will be important to determine whether this specificity, if real, results from the tendency of recursively spliced genes to be expressed in the brain, or whether cells in the nervous system have factors that promote recursive splicing. Many genes that have long introns, including those that undergo recursive splicing, are linked to neurological diseases and to autism 9 , 10 , 11 . Whether these conditions are sometimes triggered by errors in the multi-step recursive RNA-splicing process will be an exciting avenue for future studies.

Romanoski & Christopher K. Glass \n               All the cells in the body contain essentially the same genome, and arise from the progeny of a single fertilized egg. How does each cell type interpret this common set of instructions to achieve its specific identity? The Roadmap Epigenomics Project has tackled this question by defining the epigenomic signatures of a broad spectrum of human tissues and cells undergoing crucial developmental transitions (for an overview 2 , see  page 317 ). Collectively, these papers and the associated data sets provide an unprecedented resource for understanding relationships between cells and tissues, and for delineating how cell-specific programs of gene expression are achieved. Only about half of the approximately 25,000 protein-coding genes that make up the mammalian genome are expressed in any given cell type. Although many of these genes are required for general functions and are ubiquitously expressed, others are active in only one or a few cell types, or exhibit different patterns of regulation from cell to cell. A remarkable achievement of the ENCODE Project was the use of epigenomic signatures to infer the existence of hundreds of thousands of enhancer-like regions in the mammalian genome that regulate gene expression at long range. From this vast palate, each cell type is regulated by a subset of perhaps 20,000\u201340,000 enhancers, which determine its particular gene-expression profile. Enhancers are activated through interactions with transcription factors, which recognize and bind to specific DNA sequences within the enhancer region. Bound transcription factors recruit co-regulators, many of which deposit or remove modifications on histones. The way in which each cell type interprets genomic information is therefore closely linked to the organization of its DNA regulatory elements. Enhancers that are active in cell-type-specific epigenomic signatures are typically highly enriched in DNA sequences to which lineage-determining and signal-dependent transcription factors bind. Therefore, the delineation of a particular cell's active enhancer repertoire provides a powerful means of predicting the transcription factors required for that cell's identity. By extension, changes in epigenomic signatures during developmental transitions reflect activation or inhibition of such factors. Four of the papers in this issue 2 , 3 , 4 , 5  exploit these relationships to identify combinations of transcription factors that might define different cell types during development. Ziller  et al . 4  ( page 355 ) modelled neuronal development  in vitro , by generating six lineages of neuronal progenitors from embryonic stem (ES) cells, which give rise to almost every cell type of the body. The authors developed computational models to predict the transcription factors that bind to core neural-differentiation enhancers, as well as those that bind enhancers of distinct neural lineages only. Tsankov  et al . 5  ( page 344 ) studied the sets of transcription factors that bind to promoters and enhancers in the first three cell lineages that differentiate from ES cells. Sequences bound by transcription factors in one of the three lineages exhibited molecular modifications that promote gene expression, such as loss of DNA methylation. By contrast, the same DNA regions exhibited repressive modifications in the other two cell types. Both Ziller  et al . and Tsankov  et al . found that regulatory elements controlling genes that are essential for cellular identity are often also epigenetically modified in parental cells, highlighting the importance of existing regulatory landscapes and stage-specific expression of transcription factors for defining the developmental potential of cells. Some major caveats should be noted. These studies are based on analysis of cell populations, and therefore miss potentially crucial aspects of cellular variability within populations. When tissues are examined, enhancer landscapes represent the composite of the cell types that make up that tissue, not a pure cell population. Studies 10 , 11  of different populations of white blood cells called macrophages suggest that the tissue environment can shape enhancer landscapes, emphasizing the value of studying purified cell populations from  in vivo  sources. Finally, although the DNA sequences found in cell-specific enhancers provides clues to the identities of the transcription factors that regulate enhancer activation, functional roles must be validated experimentally. The Roadmap Epigenomics Project has made some efforts along these lines, but the large number of hypotheses generated by the current papers means that this step is largely left for future work. \n                 Hendrik G. Stunnenberg \n               For decades, biomedical science has focused on ways of identifying the genes that contribute to a particular trait, or phenotype. Approaches such as genome-wide association studies 12  (GWAS) identify locations in the human genome at which variations in DNA sequence are linked to specific phenotypes, but if the variant is located in a region of DNA that does not encode a protein, such studies rarely provide insights into the regulatory mechanisms underlying the association. In these cases, comprehensive epigenomic analyses can provide the missing link between genomic variation and cellular phenotype. The various consortia, including the Roadmap Epigenomics Program, that are gathered under the umbrella of the International Human Epigenome Consortium ( www.ihec-epigenomes.org ) have taken up the challenge of deciphering hundreds of cell-type-specific epigenomes using human cells and tissues from healthy donors and people with disease. In this issue, the Roadmap Epigenomics Project presents a wealth of epigenomes, a resource that provides a plethora of new hypotheses to be tested in relation to human health and disease. Given that epigenomes are cell-type specific, it makes sense to analyse disease-associated variants identified by GWAS in the context of the epigenome of the disease cell type. Indeed, previous groundbreaking observations 13  revealed that non-protein-coding genetic variants that are associated with phenotypic changes are often located in tissue-specific regulatory regions. The current papers use innovative analytical approaches to deepen and extend this knowledge. Gjoneska  et al . 6  ( page 365 ) made use of a mouse model of neurodegeneration that mimics Alzheimer's disease. They found that disease-related changes in gene expression in the hippocampus of the mouse brain correlate with those in post-mortem brain samples taken from people with Alzheimer's disease, but not with those from people without the disease. Subsequent detailed analyses revealed an upregulation of genes and regulatory regions linked to immune responses seen in Alzheimer's disease. Genetic variants associated with the condition seemed to be enriched within evolutionarily conserved regulatory elements that control immune pathways, but not in neuronal pathways, providing fresh entry points for treatment. Farh  et al . 7  ( page 337 ) developed an algorithm to identify non-protein-coding genetic variants that might underlie autoimmune disease. The authors found that these variants are often located in or near enhancers or promoters. However, only a small fraction of the variants cause a change in a sequence at which transcription factors are known to bind. This suggests that there is more to an enhancer than a 'simple' collection of sites of transcription-factor binding embedded in the composition of its DNA sequence. For example, flanking sequences might have a topological role affecting chromatin packaging and, consequently, DNA accessibility. Polak  et al . 8  ( page 360 ) investigated the distribution of cancer-associated genetic mutations in a set of diverse cancers, and correlated them with cell-type-specific epigenomic features. They found that the mutation profile of each cancer could often be predicted from the epigenomic signature of the cell type from which that cancer was most likely to have originated. Remarkably, the epigenomic signatures of cancer-cell lines (which are often used to study disease) were poor predictors of this profile. The authors conclude that the density and distribution of cancer mutations are strongly linked to a cell-type-specific epigenomic signature. What comes next? The Roadmap Epigenomics Project has reached a major milestone, but the epigenomes of 127 cell types are just the beginning of the road to a comprehensive epigenome encyclopaedia. The International Human Epigenome Consortium plans to determine the epigenomes of every cell type in the human body \u2014 estimated to be several hundred to a thousand. Furthermore, each cell type must be analysed in many individuals, to assess the effect of genetic variation on personal cell-type-specific epigenomes. Finally, studies monitoring the epigenomic changes that arise as a result of ageing and of changes in environmental factors such as nutrients and metabolites will also be interesting. The epigenomics project has taught us that analysis and comparison of the genome and epigenome of healthy and diseased cells is essential for detecting and understanding the drivers of multifactorial diseases and traits. \n                 Laurence Wilson & Genevieve Almouzni \n               Chromatin is the complex of DNA, RNA and proteins that packages DNA within the cell. At the core of chromatin is an eight-subunit protein complex composed of histones. Molecular modifications to either DNA or histones can affect the structure and function of chromatin. For example, some modifications promote chromatin compaction, affecting how easily DNA can be accessed by transcription factors, whereas others act as signals that modulate gene expression. A case in point is modification of the amino-acid residue lysine 27 (K27) on histone H3 in chromatin. Addition of an acetyl group (a modification known as H3K27ac) correlates with transcription of the corresponding region of DNA, whereas trimethylation (H3K27me3) is linked to transcriptional repression. Several papers published by the Roadmap Epigenomics Project investigate histone modifications, and provide insights into the relationship between histone signatures and gene expression throughout development and adult life. For instance, three studies investigate the histone modifications associated with disease 6 , 7 , 8 . Focusing on normal development, Tsankov  et al . 4  and Ziller  et al . 5  have mapped histone modifications that occur during the differentiation of embryonic cells (specifically, H3K4me1, H3K4me3, H3K27ac and H3K37me modifications), alongside patterns of transcription-factor binding and DNA methylation. They describe chromatin remodelling events that alter the accessibility of DNA sequences to which combinations of key regulatory transcription factors bind. These events correlate with the changes in gene expression that occur as cells differentiate. In addition to the linear viewpoint of chromatin alterations presented through histone modifications, long-range chromatin interactions can also modulate gene expression \u2014 for instance, by bringing distant enhancers into contact with promoters that regulate the same gene. Dixon  et al . 9  ( page 331 ) investigated this phenomenon, charting changes in three-dimensional (3D) chromatin organization during stem-cell differentiation. Human cells contain two copies, or alleles, of each gene, which can vary in terms of DNA sequence, resulting in differences in transcriptional activity (allele-restricted transcription). The allelic complement of a cell is known as its haplotype. Strikingly, Dixon and colleagues report that different haplotypes display different histone modifications and 3D chromatin organization, correlating with its allele-restricted transcription. Leung  et al . 3  ( page 350 ) confirmed this observation, reporting haplotype-specific differences in histone modifications and chromatin architecture that correlate with allele-restricted transcription across many tissues. Notably, these differences also correlate with mutations that disrupt sites of either transcription-factor binding or long-range chromatin interactions. However, the functional relevance of these imbalances remains to be deciphered. These eight studies showcase the use of the first large-scale reference epigenome database, taking advantage of the statistical power afforded by large sample sizes to formulate hypotheses about the relationships between the epigenome and the genome in different biological processes. They strengthen the link between chromatin modifications and gene expression in development and disease, defining core regulatory circuits that act in different tissues and at different developmental stages. This provides the community with a powerful reference tool, allowing researchers to compare the epigenome in their tissue of choice with snapshots from the database. It is, however, still early days. Future work should try to address the changing relationship between the epigenome and genome over the lifespan of the cell, in different phases of the cell cycle and across cellular generations. Other factors that modulate chromatin organization also remain to be investigated \u2014 the proteins responsible for chromatin remodelling, for example, and the chaperone proteins associated with histone variants that control assembly and disassembly of chromatin 14 . Defining the mechanisms that underlie chromatin-based regulation of gene expression will require integration of the observations made by the Roadmap Epigenomics Project with other approaches that directly test for function. For instance, model organisms will remain essential for comparative epigenomics and for garnering evolutionary information. Cutting-edge techniques, such as high-resolution microscopy, will allow live imaging of chromatin architecture and a means of studying its dynamics in space and time. Above all, approaches and technologies that draw from different disciplines must be integrated in future epigenomic projects. This multidisciplinary approach is being catalysed by collaborations such as the EpiGeneSys network ( www.epigenesys.eu ), which bridges epigenetics and systems biology. Combining such efforts will be essential for understanding the functional link between the epigenome and the genome.\n Footnote  1 Correspondence to\n                 Casey E.

The process by which X-rays elicit arousal and orienting reactions in mammals has not yet been determined. However, for simplicity we assume this mechanism operates via a 'radiation receptor'. Attempts to locate this hypothetical radiation receptor have yielded conflicting results ... We used a narrow 3/16-in. X-ray beam as a signal or conditioned stimulus to warn the animal of a subsequent shock to the paws. The beam was most effective when it was directed at the olfactory region of the head ... In an attempt to clarify this issue, we conducted a study of the effectiveness of X-ray as an arousing stimulus in rats the olfactory bulbs of which had been removed ...

It is no picture of a scientist working and living in some 'ivory tower', or even of Thomson's Newton, \u201cstemming alone vast eternity's unbounded sea\u201d, but rather of a happy voyager of strange seas of thought, in company with others trained in the same or many other disciplines. \n               From  \n               Nature \n                4 September 1965 \n             \n               100 Years Ago \n             In his presidential address, read at the Association of Museums, San Francisco, Dr. O.

More especially is this to be urged in view of the danger which threatens such institutions in the immediate future in regard to the policy of national retrenchment which is now in process of formation. There is a danger that the pruning-hook may be used too ruthlessly, thereby inflicting material harm. For reformers are generally enthusiasts, and therefore are to be carefully watched, experience having shown that a sense of proportion is not usually among their attributes. Museums, as he remarks, are even now commonly regarded as a luxury, but he leaves no uncertainty as to the vitally important part which the modern museum plays, and must continue to play, in ever-increasing force, in our national life. \n               From  \n               Nature \n                2 September 1915 \n               Footnote  1 \n             Reprints and Permissions"},

In order to understand the world, every person needs to have some knowledge of atoms and molecules.\u201d This is the beginning paragraph of a fascinating work of art ... The question as to how some understanding of science, however superficial, can be brought to the man and woman in the street has exercised many organizations as well as individuals. At a practical level, of course, it is unnecessary to know anything about electric currents in order to turn a switch and bring on the light. Babies love to do it before they are one year old. But for all too many people science is still magic even when they are twenty-one ... Linus Pauling worries. He thinks, quite rightly, that young people ought to want to know why the 'lead' of a pencil comes off on to the paper, what an atom of hydrogen or uranium 'looks like' ...
