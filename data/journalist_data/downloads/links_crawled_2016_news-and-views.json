Hecla  has discovered a number of marked elevations of the ocean bed approximately on a line between St. Helena and the islands of the Bight of Biafra ... The continuous graphical traces made by the precision depth recorder during the traverses indicate that these are rugged topographical features, trending north-east and south-west ... Measured from the abyssal depths from which they rise (2,600 fathoms in the north-west to 3,100 fathoms in the south-east) these features have an elevation exceeding that of the Alps ... The seamounts are near and may form part of the submerged feature, shown on certain American bathymetric charts as \u201cThe Guinea Ridge\u201d. \n               From  \n               Nature \n                24 December 1966 \n             \n               100 Years Ago \n             Soon after the outbreak of the war, my father, Lord Roberts, asked the public to lend their glasses for the use of the Army.

The instruments sent comprise every type, and have been classified and issued according to the needs of different units. Particularly useful have been the fine prismatic glasses sent, which have been allocated to artillery and machine-gun units, according to their power; large mounted telescopes for batteries, deer-stalking telescopes for gunners and snipers, and good old-fashioned non-prismatic racing glasses for detection of the nationality of aircraft, locating snipers signalling by disc, collecting wounded, and musketry instruction. \n               From  \n               Nature \n                21 December 1916 \n               Footnote  1 \n             Reprints and Permissions"},

NASA's Dawn spacecraft, in orbit around Ceres since March 2015, subsequently found water ice on the dwarf planet, in a small, mid-latitude crater named Oxo. Now, writing in  Nature Astronomy , Platz  et al . show that polar regions of Ceres that lie in perpetual darkness trap and preserve water ice, providing valuable information about the processes that create water reservoirs on planetary bodies (T. Platz  et al .  Nature Astron.   http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41550-016-0007 ; 2016). Permanently shadowed areas on airless planetary bodies, usually found in craters at polar latitudes, have favourable conditions for retaining water ice. Without sunshine, these regions are extremely cold (a few tens of kelvin), and can therefore efficiently trap water molecules and retain them for geological timescales. This cold-trapping process is known to be active on the Moon and on Mercury. Platz and colleagues analysed images obtained by Dawn's Framing Camera to reconstruct complete maps of the shadowed areas of the northern polar region of Ceres (pictured). They find more than 600 craters in perennial shadow, 10 of which exhibit bright features. One of these features has a (partially) illuminated portion, allowing Platz  et al . to perform a spectral analysis using Dawn's imaging spectrometer. The spectra show clear signatures of water ice, providing definitive evidence for the nature of these bright deposits. The authors also constrain the timescale of water-ice production on Ceres using the fact that ice deposits evolve through two competing mechanisms: slow accumulation by cold-trapping and destruction by impact 'gardening', the overturning of planetary soil by impacts. The authors estimate that the deposits are young (not more than a few hundred thousand years old), which implies that ice delivery is continuously active. In addition, the deposits are relatively scarce (compared with, for example, those on Mercury), suggesting that Ceres is unable to retain much water or didn't have much to begin with.

It is also known that a nerve impulse releases the transmitter in quantal form, that is, in discrete multimolecular amounts of a fairly standard size... The question is raised whether other ions can replace calcium in this process and if so is the transmitter still released in quantal form?... Fig. 1 shows sample records from one experiment where calcium and strontium were applied simultaneously to different synaptic spots on the same end-plate... These experiments show that strontium can replace calcium in the process of transmitter release by a nerve impulse and that the transmitter is still released in quantal fashion. \n               From  \n               Nature \n                10 December 1966 \n             \n               100 Years Ago \n             Prof. J.

Writing in  Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , Hurst  et al . report retreat rates for cliffs on the south coast of Britain (pictured) over thousands of years, and show that this erosion has speeded up in recent centuries (M. D. Hurst  et al .  Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA   http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1613044113 ; 2016). The authors combine high-precision isotopic dating with a detailed numerical model of coastal erosion. They find that retreat rates were relatively slow (2\u20136 centimetres per year) until a few hundred years ago before subsequently accelerating (reaching 22\u201332 cm yr \u22121 ), and suggest that this is driven by a combination of environmental and anthropogenic factors. The results show that a careful analysis of long-term coastal records can uncover more-recent changes, which will help in developing predictive models.

On  page 215 , Speyerer  et al . report how images taken by the orbiter's camera have been used to quantify the current rate at which lunar craters form as a result of surface impacts by comets, asteroids and associated fragments ( E. J. Speyerer  et al .  Nature   538 , 215\u2013218; 2016 ). The authors compared pairs of images of the Moon's surface taken at different times, and discovered that 222 craters had formed in the periods between the images being taken. They therefore estimate that about 180 craters of at least 10 metres in diameter form annually across the entire Moon. This is 33% more than would have been expected from a commonly used model of impact frequency. By calculating the ratios of surface reflectance between pairs of images, Speyerer  et al . uncovered distinct zones of subtly modified reflectance around the newly formed craters. The zones extend many crater widths out from the centre and are not visible to the naked eye (pictured are the ratios for a 12-m crater; dark regions reveal a zone that splays out up to 1,800 m from the centre). The authors propose that these zones are caused by impact-induced jets of melted and vaporized material formed early in the crater-formation process. The researchers also detected thousands of subtle surface disturbances \u2014 changes in local reflectance that lack a resolvable crater rim. They interpret many of these as the scars of secondary impacts that churned up the upper few centimetres of the surface without forming a resolvable crater. Speyerer and colleagues therefore propose that the upper 2 centimetres of loose surface material on the Moon will be reworked in about 81,000 years, 100 times faster than previously predicted.

The increasing prevalence of obesity will have an even greater effect on the health-care system than previously predicted, because obesity turns out to be a major risk factor for the development of cancer 1 . Obese individuals have a substantially elevated risk for a type of pancreatic cancer known as pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, which is the fourth most-common cause of cancer-associated death 1 . An inflammatory microenvironment is a hallmark of cancer, but little is known about how alterations in the surrounding connective tissue (stroma) contribute to tumour initiation and progression in obesity. Writing in  Cancer Discovery , Incio  et al . 2  report their investigation into how fat cells in the microenvironment surrounding cancer cells contribute to tumour initiation and progression in both mice and humans. Tumour formation in the pancreas involves striking structural distortion of tissue, which is attributed to the disruption of digestive-enzyme-containing acinar cells, tissue infiltration by immune cells, a strong fibrotic response (also known as fibrosis, the formation of excess connective tissue or collagen protein around the tumour), and a higher than usual level of deposition of extracellular-matrix material. Cancer lesions in obese individuals are commonly associated with increased fat-cell (adipocyte) content compared with tumours from non-obese patients; however, the function of these fat cells in pancreatic cancer remained unclear until now. Incio and colleagues show that, in mice, adipocytes, along with immune cells and pancreatic stellate cells, signal through the IL-1\u03b2 protein and the AT1 angiotensin receptor to drive migration of immune cells called neutrophils to the tumour microenvironment. This increases the inflammatory and fibrotic response in the pancreatic-cancer microenvironment in a way that results in poor response to chemotherapy and poor prognosis. In obese mice, the tumour microenvironment was shown to contain adipocytes that are increased in both size and number, partly as a result of tumours invading the neighbouring white adipose tissues. The researchers observed an abundant fibrotic response in tumour areas that were enriched in adipocytes or located adjacent to adipose tissue. These results suggest that fibrosis is a hallmark of adipose tissue in obese subjects with pancreatic cancer, and that the accumulation of the extracellular-matrix protein collagen, a component of the fibrotic response, in the vicinity of fat cells is a prominent characteristic of obesity. Incio and colleagues also found that adipocyte infiltration into the tumour microenvironment correlates with worse prognosis and treatment outcome in patients. The authors hypothesized that, in people with pancreatic cancer, obesity-associated adipocyte accumulation increases fibrosis, promotes tumour progression and hinders the delivery and efficacy of chemotherapeutics. When they checked the percentage of perfused blood vessels in a given area of mouse tumour, they found that it was significantly reduced in obese animals. To determine whether impeded perfusion through blood vessels is responsible for inefficient delivery of chemotherapeutic agents, the authors measured the uptake of the chemotherapy drug 5-fluorouracil in mice. Obesity significantly decreased tumour uptake of the drug compared with uptake in non-obese control animals, thereby reducing the chemotherapy's efficacy ( Fig. 1 ). Chronic fibrosis is thought to have a crucial role in enhancing tumour growth and in attenuating drug delivery. However, in previous studies, inhibition of chronic fibrosis by either inhibitor compounds 3  or genetic mutations 3 , 4  resulted in increased immunosuppression, accelerated tumour growth and decreased survival, implying that tumour stroma may be restrictive to tumour growth. By contrast, Incio  et al . show that inhibition of the major pro-fibrotic pathway of AT1 signalling in mice inhibited tumour progression. The authors propose that migration into the tissue of tumour-associated neutrophils and IL-1\u03b2 production are leading drivers in the regulation of tumour growth in this context, although changes in vascular perfusion due to reduced blood pressure also play a minor part. When the authors depleted neutrophils or blocked the activity of IL-1\u03b2 using antibody treatment, the immunosuppressive microenvironment was reshaped and the progression of pancreatic cancer was reduced. When experimentally targeting AT1 signalling in mice, other processes downstream of AT1 signalling \u2014 such as the epithelial-to-mesenchymal cell transition or adipocyte differentiation \u2014 might also be affected, and it is possible that these processes are responsible for the decrease in obesity-associated tumour progression. Even though the authors correlated fibrotic response with tumour size, it is difficult to judge whether the fibrotic response or tumour growth comes first, because decreased tumour progression will eventually result in decreased immune-cell infiltration into the tumour microenvironment and decreased fibrosis. Either way, the results of this study and others 3 , 4  reinforce the need for further evaluation of the functional contribution of fibrosis in the initiation and progression of pancreatic cancer, especially in obesity. Cellular alterations induced by mechanical forces are becoming more widely recognized as having a role in various diseases 5 . Homeostasis in the balance between internal and external forces on cells (the state of physical tension known as tensional homeostasis) can regulate apoptotic cell death, cell proliferation, adhesion and migration, and its deregulation could result in increased susceptibility to cancer. In addition, physical cues from the pressure exerted by solid-tissue components of the tumour microenvironment can compress blood vessels, causing poor tumour perfusion 6 . Incio and colleagues showed that treatment with the AT1 blocker losartan can reduce mechanical stress on cells and decrease tumour growth in mice with pancreatic cancer. More research is needed to investigate the type of transcriptional switch that tensional homeostasis induces in the dense cellular milieu of the tumour microenvironment in obesity. Inhibition of the mechanical forces acting on cells in pancreatic cancer may provide further clues for future clinical treatment. Normalizing the tumour extracellular matrix by reducing matrix stiffness may be more effective and safer than trying to delete stromal components directly. The relationship between fat cells and stem-cell regulation is another key question. Mature white adipocytes \u2014 fat stores that control energy metabolism \u2014 respond to nutritional and hormonal cues through the secretion of signalling proteins. Studies point to white adipose fat having functions in tissue regeneration and stem-cell regulation, placing fat cells at the centre of multiple aspects of cancer progression 7 . Mesenchymal stem cells and stromal stem cells contribute substantially to adipocyte generation. Mechanical stress is also a trigger for the expansion of some stem-cell populations 8 . It would be interesting to determine the origin of adipocytes in the pancreas, their fate and phenotype (whether the cells form white or brown fat, as well as the type of component they secrete). Other potential topics for investigation include studying the contribution of adipocyte-derived signals that recruit and possibly polarize immune-cell differentiation; the function of adipocyte invasion during tumour formation; and the role of malfunctioning energy metabolism in obesity. Incio and colleagues' work provides a plausible cellular and molecular explanation for increased adipocyte interaction with the cells of the pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic tumour microenvironment that accelerates disease progression and hampers therapy. Is systemically targeting tumour-associated neutrophils, pancreatic stellate cells or adipocytes feasible without causing collateral damage to host functions? Such damage could be a major challenge to successful direct translation of the current findings to the clinic. Only time will tell whether targeting IL-1\u03b2 or neutrophils could offer opportunities for successful therapeutic intervention. Of course, the best preventive approach in the meantime is to eat a healthy diet and to exercise.\n Footnote  1 Correspondence to\n                 Melek Canan Arkan . \n                     Stem cells: Dietary fat promotes intestinal dysregulation \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

{"file_id": "534045a", "url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/534045a", "year": 2016, "authors": [{"name": "David Dobson"}], "parsed_as_year": "2006_or_before", "body": "Measurements of the electrical resistance and thermal conductivity of iron at extreme pressures and temperatures cast fresh light on controversial numerical simulations of the properties of Earth's outer core.  See Letters    p.95  &  99 Earth's core acts like a storage heater, with heat released during crystallization of the inner core that buffers the slow cooling of the planet as it radiates its heat to space. The most obvious expression of this heat transfer is Earth's magnetic field, which is generated by convection in the liquid outer core. But the magnitude of the transfer is controlled by thermal conduction across the boundary between the core and mantle. In 2012, first-principles numerical simulations 1 , 2  indicated that the thermal conductivity of liquid iron in the outer core is so high that this region might act as a pump that pushes heat towards the core\u2013mantle boundary faster than convection can. If, as these controversial studies suggest, the core is losing heat at such a high rate, it means that the magnetic field must work in previously unimagined ways 3 , and that the solid inner core must be less than a billion years old 4  \u2014 a mere babe in planetary terms. In this issue, Ohta  et al . 5  ( page 95 ) and Kon\u00f4pkov\u00e1  et al . 6  ( page 99 ) report studies that experimentally tested the simulations' results using complementary, but distinct, approaches and come to different conclusions. Both groups use laser-heated diamond-anvil cells to generate the extreme temperatures and pressures of the core\u2013mantle boundary, but that is where the similarity ends. Ohta  et al . measured the electrical resistance of iron wires, which is closely related to the wires' thermal conductivity ( Fig. 1a ). To convert the resistivity measurements to a measure of the thermal conductivity of liquid iron in the outer core, the authors fitted their data to a model of resistivity that assumes that resistance approaches a limit at high temperature (a phenomenon called resistivity saturation). This then allowed them to use the Wiedemann\u2013Franz relationship between resistance and thermal conduction in metals to calculate the thermal conductivity. Both of these procedures have good theoretical bases and are well established for low-pressure observations. The observed high electrical conductivities resulted in a predicted outer-core thermal conductivity of around 90 watts per metre per kelvin, which is in reasonable agreement with the 2012 simulations 1 , 2 . By contrast, Kon\u00f4pkov\u00e1  et al . directly measured thermal conduction by watching a heat pulse propagate through a solid iron sample after heating with a nanosecond laser pulse ( Fig. 1b ). The time taken for the pulse to pass from the heated side of the sample to the other side, and the amplitude difference of the pulse between the two sides, are functions of the thermal conductivity of the sample, as well as of the surrounding solid medium that transmits pressure from the diamonds to the sample and thermally insulates the sample from the diamonds. After some careful mathematical modelling of the temperature field in the diamond cell, the authors extracted the thermal conductivity of iron from time-resolved changes in the brightness and wavelength of the glow from the white-hot sample. They obtained a thermal conductivity of about 30 W m \u22121  K \u22121 , similar to early predictions of outer-core conductivity 7 . But this leaves us with a conundrum: how to reconcile the high thermal conductivity reported by Ohta and colleagues on the basis of resistance measurements with the low thermal conductivity measured by Kon\u00f4pkov\u00e1 and co-workers. Maybe there were unknown complications with the experiments? For example, the extremely short laser pulses used by Kon\u00f4pkov\u00e1  et al . might have caused the sample to partially melt for a short period, which could have gone unnoticed during the experiment. If so, then the melting phase transition would have acted as a thermal buffer (much as the crystallization of the inner core buffers Earth's temperature) and caused an apparent decrease in thermal conductivity. This might explain why the measured thermal conductivities decrease so strongly with temperature, particularly at temperatures approaching the melting temperature. Or maybe Ohta  et al . underestimated the heat loss through the electrodes in their experiments, which would mean that the average sample temperature was less than the measured value. This could have made it look as though resistivity was saturating, even if it wasn't. Alternatively, the proportionality constant between electrical resistance and thermal conduction (the Lorenz number) might become strongly temperature dependent at the extreme pressures and temperatures of the experiment \u2014 this would point to previously unobserved fundamental physics. Despite the discrepancy, these two studies are experimental feats, measuring complex physical properties of samples smaller than a pinhead at pressures greater than 1 million atmospheres, and at temperatures above 4,000 K. The fact that the results agree within a factor of three is a remarkable success, but the devil is in the detail. The discrepancy makes a big difference to estimates of when the inner core formed, and hence when Earth generated a stable magnetic field \u2014 the inner core could be as little as 700 million years old, about the same age as complex life; or as much as 3 billion years old, about three-quarters of Earth's age. More experimental and theoretical work is needed to resolve the discrepancy and hence to constrain the age of the inner core and the workings of Earth's magnetic field.\n Footnote  1 Correspondence to\n                 David Dobson . \n                     Earth science: Another energy source for the geodynamo \n                   \n                     Earth science: Core composition revealed \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Bertulani"}, {"name": "Vladimir Zelevinsky"}], "parsed_as_year": "2006_or_before", "body": "A system of four neutrons known as the tetraneutron is a hypothetical state in nuclear physics. The report of evidence for the fleeting existence of this state has implications for research into neutron stars. Atomic nuclei are composed of protons and neutrons, generically known as nucleons. These are not genuine elementary particles because they contain quarks and gluons, which interact with each other through the strong force (one of the four fundamental forces of nature). The strong interaction has subtle properties, with the most unsettling one being that quarks and gluons are never free, only confined within nucleons. Theorists continue to struggle to find exact solutions for various states of the highly complex quark\u2013gluon systems, and to explain the nucleon\u2013nucleon force that extends beyond the confinement region. One long-sought state is the four-neutron system known as the tetraneutron, which has no electric charge. Writing in  Physical Review Letters , Kisamori  et al . 1  present evidence for the existence of such a state. In the authors' experiment, strongly bound \u03b1-particles (composed of two protons and two neutrons, and therefore identical to helium-4 nuclei) in liquid helium-4 ( 4 He) are used as a target for an incident beam of helium-8 ( 8 He, the 'projectile nucleus').  8 He has two protons and six neutrons, and is produced in nuclear-fragmentation reactions in which oxygen-18 hits a beryllium target. The reaction between  8 He and  4 He is an appropriate choice for generating tetraneutrons, because the four 'extra' neutrons in  8 He are weakly bound and can be easily transformed in the interaction with  4 He. The authors observed that the  8 He projectile exchanges two units of charge with the  4 He target and becomes a beryllium-8 nucleus ( 8 Be, four protons and four neutrons), the energy of which was measured with high precision. Because of charge conservation, the two protons in the target  4 He nucleus are substituted by neutrons, momentarily generating a four-neutron system in a quasi-bound state. This lasts only a few multiples of 10 \u221222  seconds, after which it disassembles into free neutrons. This short-lived state appears as a bump in the energy spectrum of the  8 Be nucleus that emerges from the reaction. Nuclear forces are essentially identical between all nucleons, whether they are protons or neutrons. So it might seem strange that the tetraneutron is not bound but that the \u03b1-particle of two protons and two neutrons is strongly bound, despite the additional electrical repulsion between protons. The explanation is based on the Pauli exclusion principle, which forbids two identical nucleons from occupying the same quantum state. In the \u03b1-particle, all four particles can be in the same state because the two protons have opposite spins, as does the pair of neutrons, so that all four nucleons are different. But for four neutrons, only one pair can be in the lowest-energy state, forcing the second pair into a state of higher energy, thus making the tetraneutron unstable. By applying the principle of energy conservation to the studied nuclear reaction, Kisamori and colleagues infer that the tetraneutron system has an internal excitation energy of about 0.8 million electronvolts (MeV); the excitation energy is the difference between the tetraneutron mass and the mass of four free neutrons. If this quantity were less than zero, the system would be bound. For the observed tetraneutron it is positive, making it an unbound system that exists for a short time before it decays into free neutrons. The statistical error (\u00b1 0.65 MeV) and systematic error (\u00b1 1.25 MeV) in the experiment are large, but the case for the existence of the tetraneutron is compelling. The width of the bump in the  8 Be energy spectrum is about 2.6 MeV, and this energy uncertainty suggests that the state will eventually decay to another quantum state. The hunt for the tetraneutron has been going on for more than half a century, and experimentalists have announced the state's discovery before. In 2002, one collaboration claimed to have found a bound tetraneutron 2  in an experiment based on the detection of neutron clusters formed by fragmentation of beryllium-14 projectiles. But the result remains unconfirmed, and theorists quickly showed that, based on the best knowledge of the nucleon\u2013nucleon interactions and other arguments 3 , 4 , the existence of a bound tetraneutron was nearly impossible. However, theorists could not rule out the existence of a tetraneutron as a short-lived 'resonant' state on the basis of a dineutron\u2013dineutron structure 3 , 4 . The dineutron state is formed by two neutrons, and is not stable. It is known as a virtual state: if its energy were reduced by 66 keV, then the dineutron system would become bound. Decades earlier, it had been proposed 5  that dineutrons can become bound in the presence of additional nucleons; this mechanism is responsible for the properties of some bound nuclei that have a neutron excess, such as lithium-11, in which a pair of external neutrons forms a remote halo around the core of lithium-9. The tetraneutron cannot form an atomic nucleus because it is charge neutral and therefore cannot hold electrons. But there is an intimate relationship between the tetraneutron structure and theoretical studies of neutron stars ( Fig. 1 ), in which neutrons are compressed to densities more than 10 14  times that of water 6 . They are prevented from imploding by an outward pressure that is generated by the nucleon\u2013nucleon interaction and other quantum-mechanical effects. Nuclear physicists hope to develop a full understanding of how quarks and gluons inside nucleons generate nucleon\u2013nucleon forces, and how many-body objects evolve to form complex structures such as the uranium nucleus and neutron stars. This is a formidable task, with well-understood parts but also many missing links. If Kisamori and co-workers' report of the tetraneutron state is confirmed, even as a short-lived resonance, it will add another structure to the nuclear chart that will help to improve our understanding of the nuclear interaction.

The decision of the British Government that British money must now be decimal ... would bring some benefit, not disaster ... There will be those who claim that the duodecimal system is better because twelve has several integral factors, though it is at least as sensible to argue that the base of all arithmetic should be a prime number in order that people should not be encouraged to manipulate vulgar fractions ... More distantly, other feats of rationalization may now be attempted. Why not, for example, decimalize the day? ... A decimalized day should be a much more practical proposition. From midnight to midnight would be a million new seconds. One per cent of a day, or 10 4  new seconds, would be a convenient sub-unit roughly equal to a quarter of what is now an hour.

N. Milligan. He gives the results of his inquiry in the  Zoologist  for December. While usually stones, sea-weed, or shells are carried, tube-worms, hydroids, periwinkles, or tunicates, as chance may determine, are also used, apparently for the purposes of disguise and protection from enemies. That such objects are borne with a purpose, and not as a result of accident, is shown by the fact that when all foreign bodies are removed from the spines of urchins living in an aquarium, they will invariably be speedily replaced as soon as their loss is perceived, the tube-feet being used to perform this office. Young individuals were more assiduous in this regard than adults, but in all cases particular care was taken to conceal the anus, which is apparently a very vulnerable spot. \n               From  \n               Nature \n                20 January 1916 \n               Footnote  1 \n             Reprints and Permissions"},
