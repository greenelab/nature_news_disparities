The complete satellite weighs some 8,500 lb., of which only a small proportion, about 150 lb., is pay-load. The remainder of the object is the empty shell of the  Atlas  missile which performed the launching, about 80 ft. long and 10 ft. in diameter. The main purpose of the satellite is to act as a radio relay station, storing and re-transmitting, on frequencies of 132.45 and 139.905 Mc./s., messages sent to it from the ground. It also carries telemetry transmitters operating on 107.97 and 107.94 Mc./s. The satellite is the first to be successfully launched since July 1958, and is designated 1958 \u03b6.

One can only hope that it may be widely read and may do something to counteract the ridiculous views on diet which are the result of the cogitation of that dangerous class of people who, having a little knowledge, supply the remainder from their own imagination. In spite of the importance of a suitable diet for health, there is perhaps no other subject which breeds so many fads ... The key-word of Dr. Read's book is moderation; moderation in meat-eating, in tea-drinking, in the use of alcoholic drinks and the like. He is also moderate in the way he deals with the faddists, the vegetarians, the uric-acid-free dietists, the teetotalers, and the rest. Perhaps this method of dealing with them is the most effectual with the public, who, taken as a whole, are moderate, and temperate too. Nature  31 December 1908. Reprints and Permissions"},

The symposium was arranged to discuss the reactions of man to the conditions that will be encountered in space and on other planets, and of the equipment that will be required for survival in these hostile environments ... It is certain that man will travel into space within a few years. His first venture will probably be in orbit, close to the Earth, and lasting a few hours. His second venture will be to the Moon, and his third to one of the planets. Voyages beyond our own solar system are difficult to comprehend, but should not be dismissed too lightly. The reason for man travelling into space is a controversial subject. Some contend that he merely adds to the complexity of the space vehicle; others that he will earn his keep by taking decisions ... The fact remains, however, that he will go, and that he will be faced with many of the problems discussed at the symposium. From  Nature  13 December 1958. \n               100 years ago \n             From Prof. Haberlandt's laboratory at Graz there has been issued another paper on the perception of light by plants ... The author, Dr. K. Gaulhofer, has studied the epidermal cells of the leaves of certain plants that take up a fixed light position, and suggests that an explanation may be found in the presence of pits or clefts in the cell walls acting as light distributors ... The rays of light impinging on the edges of the pits are deflected, and consequently, underneath the pits, shadows are produced. Good instances of such pits occur in  Aporrhiza paniculata  and  Banisteria splendens , while  Hyperbaena laurifolia  and  Abuta concolor  show well-marked clefts. The combination of pits and curved cell wall in  Cocculus laurifolius  will repay examination. From  Nature  10 December 1908. Reprints and Permissions"},

Seeley"}], "parsed_as_year": "2006_or_before", "body": "Prime mover in behavioural physiology and sociobiology. Martin Lindauer, who died on 13 November 2008, was a leading light in the discovery of how honeybees communicate and learn, sense the world, find their way, and live in societies. His enduring influence will also be felt through his success in nurturing a generation of German neurobiologists and behaviourists during his tenure, from 1963 to 1973, as a professor of zoology at the University of Frankfurt. Lindauer was born in a tiny village in the foothills of the Bavarian Alps, the next to youngest of 15 children in a poor farming family. Here he grew up close to nature \u2014 including the bees in his father's hives \u2014 but he was also an outstanding student, and won a scholarship to a distinguished Bavarian boarding school in Landshut. In April 1939, he was drafted into Hitler's Work Service to dig trenches, but six months later was transferred to the army and assigned to an anti-tank unit. In July 1942, on the Russian front, he was badly wounded. This was to prove his salvation. He was removed from the front, but the other 156 men in his company went on to the Battle of Stalingrad. Only three returned alive. While recovering in Munich, Lindauer attended a lecture delivered by Karl von Frisch, a distinguished zoology professor at the university. Lindauer later recalled the occasion, saying that when he heard von Frisch talking about cell division, he felt he had returned to \u201ca world of humanity\u201d, where humans create rather than destroy. He resolved to study biology, ultimately starting his PhD research on honeybees, with von Frisch as his adviser, in the spring of 1945. The previous summer, von Frisch had made a revolutionary discovery, one for which he would eventually receive the Nobel prize: an insect, the worker honeybee, can inform her hive mates of the direction and distance to a rich food source by means of dance behaviour. Von Frisch wanted to press forward with this research, so he assigned Lindauer a relevant (but less exciting) topic, namely, how these communication dances are affected by food scent and taste. Lindauer had a knack for noticing some anomaly or behavioural quirk that would turn out to be important. So, while pursuing his assigned topic on how bees tune their dancing in relation to the properties of a food source (nectar sweetness, abundance and so on), he noticed that the bees' assessment of a food source's desirability, as indicated by their willingness to advertise the source, depends not only on its profitability as an energy source, but also on how badly the colony needs the food the bee is providing. On cool, cloudy days, when the delivery of nectar to the hive was slow, Lindauer's bees would dance for the slightest taste of sugar; by contrast, on hot, sunny days, when nectar was flowing heavily into the hive, his bees would dance only if he made his feeder super sweet. How could a forager, working out in the fields, keep herself informed of her colony's changing needs? Lindauer discovered the answer: the speed with which a forager is unloaded of nectar tells her whether the colony's need is high (fast unloading) or low (slow unloading). These findings proved a springboard for numerous studies of how 'queuing delays' are used to control processes in animal societies. Between 1945 and 1960, Lindauer repeatedly demonstrated his ability to detect the subtle features that enable coherence to emerge from the apparent tumult in a beehive. He discovered how individuals stay informed of their colony's labour needs. This process rarely involves bee-to-bee signalling; instead, each bee is mostly her own informant, devoting much time to reconnoitring inside the hive. He discovered how a colony regulates its water intake to avoid dehydration: when the need for water increases, any bee that enters the hive with a droplet of water receives a stormy welcome, with several hive bees eagerly taking her water from her, and she is thereby inspired to dance and activate additional water collectors. And he discovered how a honeybee swarm chooses its new home: house-hunting bees fly out, locate several candidate sites, then return to the swarm where they perform dances to advertise their findings to uncommitted house hunters. The more highly a site is valued, the more strongly it is advertised and the more supporters it gains. Eventually, the best site dominates the discussion and is occupied. While blazing trails in sociobiology in his own studies, Lindauer was also solving mysteries in behavioural physiology in collaboration with von Frisch. Their most notable joint project was investigating whether bees can calculate, using knowledge of the time of day and the Sun's diurnal course, a specific compass direction according to the Sun's position. Von Frisch doubted that bees were capable of this. But Lindauer persisted, and devised a clever experiment for testing the idea: bees were trained to find food in one direction (south, say) on one afternoon, then were taken overnight to an unfamiliar location and tested the next morning for the ability to orient to the south to find food. Lindauer found that they did indeed fly south on the morning of the test. In 1963, Lindauer accepted a professorship at the University of Frankfurt, where he attracted a constellation of students \u2014 including Bert H\u00f6lldobler, Eduard Linsenmaier, Hubert Markl, Randolf Menzel and R\u00fcdiger Wehner \u2014 who became his successors in advancing behavioural physiology and sociobiology in Germany. Lindauer nurtured his students by giving them the freedom to prove their talent, providing due praise and encouragement, and also guidance in writing clear and enjoyable scientific papers. Lindauer left Frankfurt in 1973 to take up a professorship at the University of W\u00fcrzburg. There he devoted himself primarily to administrative work until his retirement in 1987. In summarizing his work, Lindauer published a small volume entitled  Communication Among Social Bees , based on lectures he had delivered at Harvard University. In the preface, he expressed his pleasure in discovering how \u201ccommon problems and interests within biology [had] built new bridges ... that span the wrongs of the past\u201d. His life's work leaves us not just with a legacy of discoveries, but also with the lesson that the study of nature, such as the social order of bees, can bring sweetness out of chaos.\t Reprints and Permissions"},

Kippenberg"}], "parsed_as_year": "2006_or_before", "body": "Photonic circuits can allow light to be tightly confined on a chip. A clever experiment reveals how this process can be exploited to create optical forces that drive a nanoscale mechanical oscillator. In the 1970s, Arthur Ashkin at Bell Laboratories showed 1  that the force that light exerts on an object \u2014 the radiation pressure force \u2014 can be used to trap particles. This discovery has led to a revolution in the use of lasers to trap objects ranging from atoms to biological cells. With 'optical tweezers', for example, a laser beam is focused tightly on the surface of an object, and a spatial variation in the optical intensity creates a gradient force that causes the object to be attracted to the centre of the beam, where the intensity is highest. On  page 480  of this issue, Li  et al . 2  describe how they have used nanoscale photonic waveguides on a silicon chip to exert optical gradient forces on a nanomechanical oscillator \u2014 a first step towards unifying nanophotonics and nanomechanics. Observing how the radiation pressure force can affect a mechanical oscillator has been an experimental challenge for decades, although the use of nano- and micromechanical elements has allowed this weak force to be observed. For example, by using cavity optomechanical systems, in which photons are tightly coupled to the motion of an oscillator, both amplification and 'cooling' (the opposite of amplification) of the mechanical motion have been achieved 3 . But so far, researchers have observed only the scattering force that results when momentum is transferred as the light is reflected directly, and this force is parallel to the direction of light propagation. Gradient forces, in contrast, are transverse to the light beam. It has been noted 4  that gradient forces might occur in integrated photonic circuits, in which waveguides of a scale similar to the light's wavelength tightly confine the light. But these forces, which could be applied on a chip, haven't yet been observed. Li  et al . 2  use a clever design in which a single device constitutes both an optical waveguide and a nanomechanical resonator. Integration of the resonator is seamlessly accomplished by sending light through a nanophotonic waveguide, a portion of which is suspended to form a nanomechanical beam. This 'optomechanical' waveguide thereby serves both to confine light and to act as a mechanically compliant element that can vibrate at its fundamental frequency \u2014 10 megahertz in the present study. Crucial requirements for observing gradient forces are that the waveguides are so small that part of the optical field is evanescent (decaying exponentially with distance) and extends outside the waveguide into the substrate. The latter requirement is achieved by suspending the nanophotonic waveguide very close to a non-conducting (dielectric) substrate. In Li and colleagues' experiment, the gap between the waveguide and the (oxide) substrate is only 300 nanometres (about a fifth of the wavelength of the light used). A periodically varying gradient force can then be obtained by subjecting the light beam to a modulated power. Tuning this modulation to the resonant frequency of the nanomechanical resonator drives the oscillation of the nanomechanical beam. Driving mechanical beams is not a new idea. What is new is exciting their motion using optical gradient forces, as this should allow a much larger bandwidth than other methods, possibly extending into the microwave regime 5 , 6 . Moreover, the entire actuation method can take place 'on a chip' and does not require external fields as do other methods of actuation, such as magnetomotive forces. But how can we be sure that the gradient force really is the mechanism responsible for the oscillations? Detecting radiation pressures has long eluded researchers. One other factor known to trigger such oscillations 7 , 8  is the thermal effect resulting from thermal expansion, or heating of residual background gas molecules; these can mimic the effects of radiation pressure on the nanomechanical beam. A light mill, which can be bought from any toy store, is an example of a device that rotates through thermal effects rather than through radiation pressure 9 . Li  et al . 2  set out to quantify thermal effects on the nanomechanical beam. Their experiments, performed in a high vacuum, reveal counterintuitively that, despite the nanoscale dimension of the waveguide, thermal gradients build up over a time period that is much longer than the period of the mechanical oscillator. Therefore, by using a sufficiently fast modulated light beam, the authors could be sure that most of the resulting periodically varying force was due to the optical field gradient rather than to thermal effects. At gigahertz frequencies, thermal effects could in fact be eliminated entirely. The observation of gradient optical forces on a silicon chip has wide-ranging implications for the field of nanophotonics. Li and colleagues' work demonstrates that these forces can be exploited in nanophotonic circuits to trigger nanomechanical oscillations. But the principle of their experiment points to more general ways of incorporating nanomechanical and nanophotonic elements on a silicon chip. Silicon's useful mechanical properties (such as its low mechanical dissipation) have already been used to create the most sensitive mechanical beams to date 10 . But Li and colleagues' work points to a whole new class of photonic functionality \u2014 the use of gradient forces \u2014 in optically driven mechanical oscillators, photonic mixers 11  and narrow-band radio-frequency filters. As such, gradient optical forces might become a new element in 'silicon photonics'. Probably the greatest remaining challenge is extending the method to higher resonant frequencies, which will require an increase in the optical power needed to produce the mechanical oscillations. In the authors' experiment this power is already quite high \u2014 on the order of tens of milliwatts. One solution would be to reduce the gap between the waveguide and the substrate. Alternatively, the use of cavity nano-optomechanical systems, such as integrated silicon microresonators, would not only decrease the power required by orders of magnitude, but would also provide a route to drive the mechanical oscillator without time-varying optical fields 3 .

Less well known is that they can also act as detectors for biological compounds. Writing in  Optics Express , Bingham  et al . describe two-dimensional metamaterials designed so that, when exposed to electromagnetic radiation, their resonant frequencies coincide with those of vitamin H ( C. M. Bingham  et al .  Optics Express   16,  18565\u201318575; 2008 ). The resonant frequencies of vitamin H occur in the terahertz range, and these results thus provide an example of biodetection in that frequency regime. The properties of metamaterials lie in their structure rather than their chemical composition. One asset of these man-made materials is that they can be engineered to possess a precise response to electromagnetic radiation. Bingham and colleagues created metamaterials with designs that mimic several types of symmetry observed in nature, using both square and hexagonal tiles. Their tiles, the unit cells of metamaterial structures (shown on left of picture), consist of up to three different subunits. The overall structures (shown on right) look rather like a Persian carpet. To maximize the electromagnetic response of a metamaterial, the unit cells must be tightly tessellated \u2014 that is, the gaps between tiles must be minimized. But why incorporate more than one subunit into a tile? The advantage is that the metamaterial preserves the different electromagnetic properties of each subunit: a material formed with three distinct subunits is resonant at three different frequencies. A triple-resonator metamaterial allows a biological compound to be identified more accurately because there are three frequency-match points of comparison. With this in mind, the authors simulated metamaterial structures computationally to find the best materials for the job. They then made the best designs, shone terahertz radiation on them and recorded the electromagnetic response. As predicted, metamaterials with structures that combined three distinct subunits (such as that pictured on the lower right panel) resonated at three distinct frequencies, the individual frequencies of the different subunits. As the authors had hoped, the simulated and experimental resonances of their metamaterials were a good match for those of vitamin H. This match could therefore form the basis of a biodetector. Bingham  et al . have found that their multi-subunit tiling techniques can create multi-resonator metamaterials that can be used as biodetectors. But that is not all. Their metamaterials could potentially detect hazardous chemicals. Reprints and Permissions"},

He was among the greatest scientists of the twentieth century, whose momentous discoveries in cell biology are still actively pursued by many laboratories worldwide. The son of a philosophy professor and a teacher, Palade was born in Jassi (Ia\u015fi), the former capital of Moldavia, the eastern province of Romania. He studied medicine at the University of Bucharest. Having spent the Second World War in the medical corps of the Romanian army, he moved to Istanbul shortly before moving on to New York City in 1946 for postdoctoral studies at New York University.  Following a short stint there, in a life-changing event Palade was invited by Albert Claude to join his laboratory at the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research \u2014 now Rockefeller University. The previous year, Claude and his colleagues Keith Porter and Ernest Fullam had published the first electron micrograph of an animal cell grown in culture, describing a \u201clace-like cytoplasmic network\u201d, later named the endoplasmic reticulum. Furthermore, Claude and his collaborators George Hogeboom and Walter Schneider had recently developed procedures involving differential centrifugation to break up tissues and to separate cellular components into three main fractions \u2014 nuclei, mitochondria and 'microsomes'. So Palade joined an already famous laboratory that was on the cusp of even greater discoveries. He soon became a key member of the lab, contributing vigorously to optimizing methods for both cell fractionation (such as introducing sucrose solutions for better preservation of cellular organelles) and electron microscopy (using osmium tetroxide to get better contrast). These technical advances facilitated many pivotal discoveries by Palade and his colleagues throughout the 1950s and 1960s, among them a detailed description of the membranes of mitochondria and chloroplasts. His other achievements included the discovery in 1955 of \u201ca small particulate component of the cytoplasm\u201d \u2014 often referred to as the 'Palade granule' until it morphed into the 'ribosome' in 1958 \u2014 and the description in 1963 with Marilyn Farquhar of \u201cjunctional complexes in various epithelia\u201d, which connect epithelial cells together. With Claude moving back to Belgium in 1949, the partial disassembly of 'the Rockefeller group' began, ending with Porter's departure to Harvard in 1961. In fond memory of Porter's contributions, a picture of him, with the title \u201cOur father who art at Harvard\u201d, decorated the Palade lab at Rockefeller for many years. In parallel with his discoveries using electron microscopy, Palade sought to understand the function of these newly defined cellular structures. Biochemical studies with Philip Siekevitz in his lab on the microsome fraction were published in classic papers in which microsomes were identified as broken and sealed bits of the endoplasmic reticulum. Subsequently, through  in vivo  labelling with  14 C-leucine and isolation of labelled chymotrypsin protein from cell fractions, Palade and Siekevitz showed that this protein was primarily synthesized in microsomes. These results led to the proposal that the endoplasmic reticulum is the synthesis site for secretory proteins, an idea further supported by experiments carried out by David Sabatini and Colvin Redman, who demonstrated that the initial event in the protein secretion pathway was directional release of nascent polypeptide chains into the microsomal lumen. With another colleague, Jim Jamieson, Palade developed the technique of pulse-chase labelling in tissue slices, which allowed the pathway of secreted proteins to be tracked in time and traced within cells. One important, but initially controversial, postulate was that secretory proteins are transported in quanta \u2014 in vesicular carriers that bud from a donor membrane and deliver their contents by fusion to a target membrane. Palade ran his laboratory very informally. There were no regular lab meetings. Instead, there were bimonthly seminars, at which lab members were introduced to ideas by speakers from other labs. Often Palade summarized the essence of a presentation, particularly if the speaker had failed to do so. He had the ability to link the most disparate observations into a coherent and testable working hypothesis. He effortlessly passed this trait on to many of his students and postdocs, who chose their research topics with very little interference from him. He did, however, reserve the right to challenge research plans. While I was an assistant professor in his lab, he suggested I set up a cell-free system to study the initial step in the secretory pathway \u2014 a task much easier said than done. But after two years of trying, I succeeded and it certainly made a big difference to my career. He took considerable interest in the papers that were published by his lab. Even when he was not listed as an author, he meticulously edited and corrected each paper with his immaculate handwriting at the edge or on the opposite empty page of the typewritten manuscripts. I treasure the corrections he made on all my manuscripts during that time. Palade moved to Yale in 1973, where he stayed until he joined the University of California, San Diego (UCSD) in 1990. At both universities, he continued to make many crucial discoveries and, as at Rockefeller, built thriving departments of cell biology. At UCSD, he served as the first dean of scientific affairs until his retirement at the age of 87. Many of Palade's students and their second-, third- and fourth-generation 'descendants' are still major contributors to the field of cell biology. Among the prizes he was awarded are the Lasker prize, the Gairdner award and the Louisa Gross Horwitz Prize. He was also a joint recipient of the 1974 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. Palade was deeply interested in music, the fine arts and history. He was an eloquent speaker, and his lectures are legendary examples of his lucidity and passion for his subject. He worked productively until his late eighties, when Parkinson's disease forced him to reduce his activities. It must have been hard for him to cope with these physical constraints, although his intellectual curiosity and passion remained intact for much longer. He is survived by his wife, Marilyn Farquhar, two children from his first marriage and two grandchildren. Reprints and Permissions"},

Routine sequencing of the genomes of an African and an Asian individual offer a step forward.  The rapid progress in genetic screening assays and DNA sequencing techniques promises to increase our understanding of the complex relationship between the human genetic make-up (the genotype) and its associated traits (the phenotype). For example, using the composite human genome sequences 1 , 2 , 3 , genome-wide association studies have identified regions that control specific traits through single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) \u2014 the most common form of genetic variation. In this issue, Bentley  et al . 4  ( page 53 ) and Wang  et al . 5  ( page 60 ) detail the development and application of a high-throughput technology for sequencing DNA to decipher the genomes of two people, one of West African descent and the other of Han Chinese descent. This advance provides a technology that might eventually relate specific sequences and regions of DNA directly to human phenotypes. Although genome-wide association studies can establish a link between a genetic locus marked by adjacent SNPs and its associated phenotype, they do not automatically identify the implicated nucleotide's position, as they use only a fraction of human SNPs. Genome-wide association studies were used because of their relatively low cost compared with the technological challenge and high cost of sequencing genomes in large human populations. Sequencing the genomes of many individuals would overcome the problem of identifying which nucleotide(s) are implicated in a phenotype, as long as the procedure could be performed accurately and completely. From such data sets, DNA variants can be identified, and the frequency with which they occur in humans who carry a particular trait \u2014 such as a disease \u2014 can then be compared with their frequency in people who lack that trait. Thus, all genetic variants contributing to the trait can be identified, giving a more complete picture of the biology involved. The genomes of the anonymous African and Asian individuals supplement the existing sequenced genomes of two people of European origin, Craig Venter 6  and James Watson 7 . Both teams involved in the latest work 4 , 5  used the Illumina GA sequencing instrument, in which sequencing is performed by synthesizing fluorescently detectable DNA molecules, using the DNA from the genome being sequenced as a template. In a single cycle, this platform can produce more than 40 million discrete 'reads' of 35 nucleotides from either end of a 200- or a 2,000-nucleotide DNA fragment. Compared with the instruments used to complete the initial human genome sequence 1 , 2 , 3 , the Illumina GA generates three to four orders of magnitude more sequence per operation cycle. This instrument therefore joins the 454 Life Sciences sequencer 7  as yet another 'next generation' technology for sequencing individual human genomes. How do the two new genome sequences allow a better understanding of human genetics? Both studies 4 , 5  confirm that it is possible to routinely sequence the genome of an individual to discover the wide spectrum of DNA variations that it harbours. Of course, this process is greatly facilitated by having a reference human genome against which to compare sequence data from the two individuals. This allows the identification of SNPs, as well as insertion/deletion polymorphisms and structural variations ( Fig. 1 , overleaf). Extensive validation of the SNPs detected shows that sequencing accuracy is high. A strength of this latest approach is the extent of deep sequencing achieved, which aids SNP identification. The advantages of obtaining these two genomes, such as the identification of DNA variations, indicate that their usefulness will ultimately be much broader than simply demonstrating the technological milestone of relatively low-cost sequencing. But some goals remain. As the genomes were reconstituted on the basis of alignments with existing reference genomes, the set of non-SNP variants that are absent in the reference genome will be incomplete. For example, in these studies, the detection of structural variants \u2014 insertions or deletions of thousands of nucleotides at any one position on a chromosome \u2014 is preferential for deletions. This is because such insertions come from sequenced reads that will not overlap with the existing reference genome. There are two possible solutions to this detection bias. One would be to sequence larger DNA fragments whose ends overlap with sequences on the reference genome 8 . Alternatively, all sequenced reads could be assembled independently, before mapping them to a reference human genome 6 . Another deficiency of the four genomes 4 , 5 , 6 , 7  is that they do not accurately define copy-number variants at the nucleotide level. These forms of genetic variation arise from the insertion of multiple copies of DNA segments that may include whole genes and that have been increasingly implicated in, among other disease phenotypes, neurological disorders 9 , 10 . Our genomes are not just collections of DNA variation: parental inheritance also dictates specific associations between neighbouring variations. Knowledge of these associations will ultimately help us discover whether and how much of an aberrant protein is produced by each of our cells and how these events contribute to observed phenotypes. The association between neighbouring variations across all 23 pairs of human chromosomes is referred to as haplotype assembly, and has not yet been completely achieved in any of the individual genomes sequenced. These limitations notwithstanding, the approach of Bentley 4 , Wang 5  and their colleagues represents a substantial advance in the sequencing of individual human genomes. Together with the other two genomes sequenced 6 , 7 , they reinforce the catalogue of variants that exist in human genomes \u2014 SNPs in the millions, insertion/deletion polymorphisms in the hundreds of thousands and structural variants in the thousands. The numbers of these variants do not directly tell us how such polymorphisms contribute to the wide spectrum of human traits. But they do provide a necessary step towards accurately defining genomic loci that are likely to be implicated in those traits. With such rapid advances in next-generation technologies, and with 'third generation' technologies emerging, this is just the beginning of the era of the individual genome. Soon, association studies using complete individual genomes will become the approach of choice for understanding the complexity of human biology and disease. The latest advances have broad implications for expediting that goal. \n                 See Editorial, page 1. \n               Reprints and Permissions"},

How times change. Within the space of less than a decade, the development of high-throughput technologies has transformed the task of sequencing a mammalian genome from the years-long, multimillion-dollar endeavour it was originally, to a project that can be performed by an individual laboratory within a few months. Such is the breathtaking extent of progress that it has now been possible to sequence the nuclear genome of the extinct woolly mammoth ( Fig. 1 ) almost to completion. This achievement is described by Miller  et al . on  page 387  of this issue 1 . Stretches of mammoth DNA from a cellular organelle, the mitochondrion, which has its own small genome, have been sequenced previously. But tackling the 4 billion to 5 billion base pairs in the much larger and biologically informative mammoth cell nucleus posed a different order of challenge. Ancient DNA \u2014 DNA obtained from fossils up to about 100,000 years old \u2014 is highly fragmented, is present in only trace amounts, and is usually swamped by bacterial and fungal DNA. So the idea of sequencing the complete genome of an extinct species was long unthinkable, given that for 30 years the only large-scale method available, the Sanger sequencing method 2 , was not adequate for such a task. However, in 2005 a new way of sequencing DNA was published 3 . Known as the 454 method, it initially had a throughput of 20 million base pairs per run \u2014 an increase of two to three orders of magnitude compared with Sanger sequencing. Since then, this method's throughput has increased to about 100 million base pairs and three other types of sequencing approaches have been launched \u2014 Solexa, SOLiD and HeliScope. These methods produce as much as 10 billion base pairs of sequence data in a single run. But all of them are 'shotgun' methods, which produce rather short sequencing reads; some also have quite high error rates. So, to obtain a reliable sequence for each nucleotide position, a genome needs to be sequenced to multiple coverage, which Miller and colleagues estimate would be around 10\u201320-fold for the mammoth. Given the rapid increase in sequencing throughput, it is possible that even this will soon be achieved. These developments have both changed the way we think about molecular genetics and shown how we might finally get a handle on the genomes of extinct species. Not least, some of the drawbacks of the new technologies for studying modern DNA are advantages when it comes to ancient DNA. Thus, whereas the Sanger method allows individual stretches of up to 800 base pairs to be determined in a single reaction, the new techniques yield much shorter sequences, sometimes as few as 30 base pairs 4 . This is a disadvantage when dealing with modern DNA. But it does not matter with ancient DNA, which is mostly fragmented into pieces shorter than 100 base pairs. Researchers were quick to exploit the new possibilities. Only months after the 454 technology became available, it was applied to mammoth genomics in a paper 5  that reported 13 million base pairs of sequence \u2014 about 1,000 times more than were covered in the first ancient-genomics study with Sanger sequencing 6 . In that paper 5 , published in January 2006, the authors also announced their plan to sequence the mammoth genome to completion. Miller and colleagues 1  now describe about 70% of the mammoth genome, and so go a long way to achieving that goal. Miller  et al . were aided immensely in their task by the fact that, unusually for extinct organisms, some specimens of woolly mammoths have been frozen in permafrost. This is an ideal setting for preserving DNA, and, moreover, for preserving hair, which is an ideal source of DNA for sequencing ancient genomes. If hair still contains DNA, almost all of it will belong to the extinct species, and will not be of bacterial or fungal origin, as is often the case with bones. Thus, the authors needed to sequence a total of 'only' 4.1 billion base pairs to obtain about 3.3 billion base pairs of mammoth DNA. They calculate that the total mammoth genome, estimated at some 4.7 billion base pairs, would have been 1.4 times bigger than the human genome. Although the mammoth genome is larger than the human genome, the DNA substitution rate seems to be smaller \u2014 this is the rate at which one nucleotide replaces another, and so is a measure of evolutionary change. The mammoth genome differs from that of its close relative the African elephant by as little as 0.6%. This is about half the difference between human and chimpanzee, although the two elephant species diverged at about the same time as human and chimpanzee, and probably even slightly earlier (see Fig. 3 of the paper 1  on page 389). For some reason, the substitution rate in the nuclear genome of elephants is much lower than in humans and great apes, a result mirrored in the mitochondrial genomes 7 , where humans and great apes also show a substitution rate more than twice as high as that in the elephant species. As nuclear and mitochondrial genomes are replicated by different enzymes, it remains unclear why both genomes evolve more slowly in elephants than in humans and great apes. The draft mammoth genome sequence is too fragmented and error-prone to allow standard gene prediction. Nonetheless, Miller and colleagues identified several protein-coding positions that are unique to the mammoth compared with 50 other vertebrate species. The presence of such mammoth-specific differences is not surprising: it is to be expected that each mammalian species contains unique amino-acid substitutions compared with a limited number of other species. For example, the 52-amino-acid fragment of the ATP2C1 protein not only contains an amino-acid substitution unique to the mammoth, but a further two that are unique to the tenrec and the two-toed sloth, respectively. Similarly, the position in the 30-amino-acid fragment of the protein C1orf190, at which the mammoth differs from other placental mammals, also has amino-acid substitutions in the ground squirrel and kangaroo rat. Although Miller and colleagues argue that the amino-acid differences they identify have a \u201csignificantly enhanced likelihood of causing ... phenotypic effects\u201d, their analyses by no means prove that an amino-acid substitution has functional consequences or adaptive value. Such questions can be answered only by investigations of the proteins in question. So what do we learn from the mammoth genome, except that sequencing of complete genomes from extinct species is indeed possible and that there are differences in their DNA sequences compared with those of living animals? As with many draft genome projects, not that much. But a draft genome is only the beginning of the story. The main feature of genome projects is to provide a resource for further research, as vividly shown by the thousands of times the initial human-genome sequencing papers 8 , 9  have been cited. The next draft nuclear genome of an extinct species likely to become available is that of our closest relative, the Neanderthal, following on from publication of a complete Neanderthal mitochondrial genome sequence 10 . For some time yet, much work in genomics will consist of fully annotating and completing genome sequences, as indeed most published sequences of extant vertebrates, let alone that of the extinct mammoth, remain drafts. But when we look further into the future, the task will be to understand which differences at the sequence level underlie the phenotypic differences between a mammoth and an elephant, or a human and a Neanderthal, for which well-annotated genomes provide the essential basis.

Anatol Zhabotinsky, the father of nonlinear chemical dynamics, passed away on 16 September after a brief illness. In many ways, his scientific career represents a microcosm of the history of Russia in the second half of the twentieth century. Born in Moscow at the height of the Stalinist purges, Zhabotinsky was able to enrol in the prestigious Moscow State University in 1955, during the brief window that opened for Jews in the years following Stalin's death in 1953. Although not a religious man, Zhabotinsky was proud of his Jewish heritage and refused to change his surname to \u201csomething more Russian\u201d, even when other members of his immediate family did so to improve their prospects in an anti-Semitic society. It was as a graduate student at Moscow State that Zhabotinsky first learned of the phenomenon, now known as the Belousov\u2013Zhabotinsky (BZ) reaction, for which he was to become famous. In the early 1950s, Boris Belousov, a military research chemist studying the effects of poison gases and radiation on humans, had stumbled upon the fact that a mixture of potassium bromate, citric acid and cerium ions exhibits periodic colour changes. These oscillations indicated that the chemical state of the system was changing in a rhythmic way, rather than proceeding monotonically from a starting point to an end point, as happens in most chemical reactions. Belousov tried to publish his results in peer-reviewed journals, but eventually gave up after referees and editors insisted that such behaviour contradicted the Second Law of Thermodynamics. He instead published a one-page description of his observations in an obscure conference proceedings on radiation medicine. He circulated a recipe for the reaction as a sort of samizdat among colleagues in Moscow, and then, apparently, returned to more applied studies. A decade after Belousov's discovery, Zhabotinsky was starting his doctoral research under the direction of the biochemist Simon Schnoll. Zhabotinsky wanted to study rhythmic behaviour in glucose metabolism, but Schnoll told him that the materials required were in short supply and suggested that he take a look at Belousov's recipe (which two earlier graduate students had had little success with). Zhabotinsky, with his characteristic experimental skill and care, was soon observing chemical oscillations. He improved the recipe by substituting malonic acid for citric acid, and showed that the source of the colours was the ceric ions, rather than bromine as proposed by Belousov. He wrote up his results and sent them to Belousov for comment, receiving a supportive note in return. Attempts to establish personal contact with Belousov proved unsuccessful, however, even after Zhabotinsky's work was published and Belousov's contributions were lauded. The two never met face to face, despite working only a few kilometres apart. Zhabotinsky always suspected that Belousov, who had lost many friends in the Stalinist purges and who was employed at a secret military establishment, was wary of establishing 'extracurricular' relationships. Belousov died in 1970. The discovery of oscillating reactions revolutionized the way that scientists thought about chemical dynamics. Indeed, Ilya Prigogine \u2014 who received the 1977 Nobel Prize in Chemistry, in part for demonstrating that chemical systems far from equilibrium can exhibit periodic oscillations \u2014 regarded the BZ reaction as the most important scientific discovery of the twentieth century, surpassing quantum theory and relativity. Whether or not one accepts this assessment, it is clear that the discovery of a 'simple' chemical reaction that displays periodic temporal and spatial behaviour had far-reaching consequences, even leading to a greater understanding of the processes that underlie life itself, such as biological clocks and morphogenesis. Zhabotinsky's role was to make the scientific world aware of the importance of a phenomenon that might have been relegated to an intriguing parlour trick or lecture demonstration. He discovered early on that a thin, unstirred layer of BZ solution gives rise to beautiful spiral patterns of chemical concentration (see, for example,  http://heracles.chem.wvu.edu/gallery.html ), which were later observed to resemble those seen in aggregating slime moulds, newly fertilized frog egg cells and fibrillating hearts. At a conference on biological and biochemical oscillators held in Prague in 1968, only weeks before Soviet tanks rolled into the city, Zhabotinsky brought the BZ system to the attention of Western scientists, and the field of nonlinear chemical dynamics was born. Together with Belousov, Genrikh Ivanitsky, Valentin Krinsky and Albert Zaikin, he received the 1980 Lenin Prize, at that time the Soviet Union's highest scientific award, for his work. Perhaps because of his Jewish heritage, or perhaps because of his tendency to make politically incorrect remarks, Zhabotinsky was not allowed to travel outside the Soviet bloc until the arrival of perestroika at the end of the 1980s. When I arranged a lecture tour of the United States for him, he was surprised to discover that a chemical ordered at the beginning of his 10-day visit could arrive by the end of that period. Impressed, he asked whether a longer stay at Brandeis University might be possible. A visit of one year was arranged, starting in July 1991, but he never returned to his home country. At Brandeis, he pursued his interest in oscillatory chemical reactions, demonstrating, for example, that chemical waves in the BZ reaction obey the same laws of refraction at an interface as light waves, but that reflection of chemical waves is not perfectly mirror-like. He also returned to his initial fascination with biophysics, collaborating with neuroscientists such as John Lisman on models of synaptic transmission. With his vibrant intelligence and encyclopaedic knowledge, he was a major contributor to the education of a generation of students and postdocs, and was well known for his unwillingness to accept a vague response when a more exact answer could be dredged out by persistent questioning. When allegedly novel phenomena were described to him, he was frequently heard to remark \u201cThis was found in Russia by so-and-so thirty years ago\u201d, despite his alienation from his native land. Like the complex chemical reactions that so intrigued him, Zhabotinsky's life \u2014 and that of his beloved and not-so-beloved Russia \u2014 underwent many ups and downs, occasionally becoming chaotic. The world of science is poorer today for his loss. Reprints and Permissions"},

Brian Pippard, who died on 21 September, had many achievements, but will be remembered particularly as the first experimenter to map the Fermi surface of a metal, for his non-local theories of the response of normal metals and superconductors to electric fields, and as dynamic head of physics at the University of Cambridge from 1971 to 1982. Pippard grew up in Bristol, UK, and at school proved exceptional in music as well as science. He entered Clare College, Cambridge, in 1938, and, doubting his mathematical ability, chose first to study chemistry, before switching to physics to make himself useful during the Second World War. He worked at the Great Malvern research establishment on a radar device for tracking mortar projectiles, returning to Cambridge for his PhD in 1945. He was already familiar with the skin effect, the restriction of microwave fields to a thin surface layer in metals, and his supervisor David Shoenberg encouraged him to study it in superconductors \u2014 materials that mysteriously lose all electrical resistance below a sharply defined transition temperature. In 1935, Fritz and Heinz London had hinted that a superconductor might be a quantum fluid, a system of many electrons governed by a wavefunction similar to that of a single electron, as though they were all in the same quantum state. In such a system, the inertia of the superelectrons should lead to a purely inductive conductivity at high frequencies. By measuring the frequency and bandwidth of microwave resonators made of tin and mercury, Pippard successfully observed this effect when he cooled the resonators through their superconducting phase transitions. Pippard's experiments were models of simplicity. For instance, the frequency of his klystron microwave source had to be stable to one part in a million, yet he achieved this using no more than draught protection, a micrometer tuner with a weight and pulley to eliminate backlash, and a stack of carefully aged high-voltage batteries as power supply. In 1940, Heinz London had noticed that the microwave surface resistance of normal metals, instead of falling steadily with falling temperature as the resistivity did, reached a limit. Pippard confirmed this 'anomalous skin effect' in his own samples and realized that it occurred when the electron free path became larger than the skin depth, and that only those electrons moving parallel to the sample surface remained effective in responding to the electric field. This idea led quickly to a complete theory of the effect, published in 1948 by Harry Reuter and Ernst Sondheimer, and Pippard's simple ineffectiveness concept was later applied in understanding many other phenomena, such as cyclotron resonance and ultrasonic attenuation in metals. After his doctorate, Pippard became interested in the stability of normal metal\u2013superconductor (NS) boundaries, and introduced the idea that their energy was determined by a characteristic coherence length. This length was later identified with that of the celebrated Ginzburg\u2013Landau theory, and proved crucial in understanding the physics of type II superconductors, used in making superconducting magnets. Pippard's work on the anomalous skin effect encouraged him to wonder whether, just as in normal metals the current at a given point depends on the electric field at neighbouring points through which the electrons had travelled since last being scattered, the superconducting current might likewise depend on the electric field at distant points \u2014 the range being limited by an electromagnetic coherence length. In 1953 he proposed a model of this non-local effect. It proved entirely successful; and in 1957, when John Bardeen, Leon Cooper and Robert Schrieffer published their revolutionary theory of superconductivity, they were at pains to demonstrate that it confirmed Pippard's model. In 1954, Pippard pointed out that in the anomalous skin effect, the surface impedance of a metal is related to its Fermi surface \u2014 the theoretical boundary in momentum-space within which the conduction electrons of a metal reside \u2014 and in fact provides a measure of the curvature of this surface near the effective electrons. In 1955, during a sabbatical year at the University of Chicago, Pippard measured the surface resistances of single-crystal samples of copper in various orientations, and on his return to Cambridge used his data to map out the Fermi surface of copper, a widely recognized tour de force. He was elected to the Royal Society in 1956. In 1962, Pippard's student Brian Josephson independently proposed a theory of quantum tunnelling between superconductors, which subsequently earned him a Nobel prize (in 1973). Pippard was not directly involved, but later enthusiastically took up the study of the physics of SNS Josephson junctions, and of the peculiar phenomena that occur when the superconducting current is converted to normal current at an SN interface. During the same period, his book  Dynamics of Conduction Electrons  established him as an expert on all aspects of Fermi-surface phenomena, especially magnetoresistance, helicon waves, and magnetic breakdown in which electrons tunnel through momentum space from one part of the surface to another. In 1966, Pippard became the first president of Clare Hall, informal and happy home of graduates and distinguished visitors, and of his wife Charlotte and their three daughters. In 1971, he was elected to the Cavendish chair in the department of physics, but even before that had been the moving spirit behind the much needed transfer of the Cavendish Laboratory to new buildings. As head of department from 1971, he encouraged innovative research and tried persistently \u2014 though not always successfully \u2014 to close down areas he judged to be less worthy. He was proactive in the reform of undergraduate teaching, and insisted on lecturing ability in staff appointments. He was himself always a stimulating teacher, and his perceptive  Elements of Classical Thermodynamics  and challenging  Cavendish Problems in Classical Physics  excited and tormented generations of students. He was president of the Institute of Physics during 1974\u201376. Brian could be idiosyncratic. He was suspicious of mathematical formalism, and once, when invited to deliver a keynote speech to an international audience, selected as its title 'The cat and the cream', and startled his listeners by announcing the imminent demise of solid-state physics. He was capable of great kindness, but also relished being boyishly clever: his inaugural lecture as Cavendish professor was planned around an intriguing series of bench experiments whose outcomes the assembled practitioners, young and old, were invited to predict, by show of hands. We duly got most of our predictions wrong, as he intended. Reprints and Permissions"},

Much of this effort focuses on finding new designs that open up fresh applications. John Rogers and colleagues now report just such a development (J. Yoon  et al. \u00a0 Nature Mater.  doi:10.1038/nmat2287; 2008 ) \u2014 tiny, ultrathin cells made of silicon that, when fixed in arrays on a flexible substrate, create large, bendy solar cells (pictured). The authors carve their microcell arrays from a rectangular block of silicon. They begin by etching the outlines of the microcells (the tops and sides) onto the upper surface of the silicon block. They then make electronic junctions and electrical contacts by 'doping' the silicon, adding boron and phosphorus, and using an inert mask to define the regions to be doped. A further round of etching exposes the final three-dimensional shape of the microcells, retaining a thin sliver of silicon to anchor the cells to the block. Finally, the base of the wafer is doped with boron, to yield functioning solar microcells. To make bendable, large-scale solar cells, Rogers and colleagues use a printing technique. They press a flat stamp onto the arrays of microcells on the silicon block, breaking the anchors that tether them to the silicon. The microcells stick to the soft surface of the stamp, and are transferred to a flexible substrate simply by pressing the stamp onto the substrate. The authors then construct electrodes to connect the microcells to each other, using one of various established methods. The resulting devices have several desirable properties. First, they are remarkably light, which, along with their flexibility, allows them to be transported and installed more easily than existing solar cells. Second, they work just as efficiently when bent as they do when flat, so they could be fixed to curved or irregular surfaces. Furthermore, they can be made to be transparent, which would allow them to be used on windows. And because the microcells are so thin, less silicon is used, minimizing costs.

The same line of study points to a basic distinction between two types of surface wave. The sea floor is a vibrant place \u2014 earthquakes, volcanoes, man-made explosions and ships are all causes of disturbances that can be monitored by instruments on the ocean bottom. Data from arrays of sea-floor seismometers also provide information about the structure of Earth's interior 1 , but in this case in particular, intricate analysis is required to separate the desired signal from 'noise'. One source of such noise is the pressure fluctuations arising from wind-generated waves on the ocean surface. Despite the attenuation caused by the water column, the pressure signals from surface waves can reach the sea floor even in the deep ocean. A new and unexpected angle on this general phenomenon comes in a paper by Farrell and Munk just published in  Geophysical Research Letters 2 . Even during a hurricane, it is fairly calm not far beneath the surface of the sea. The powerful swells are attenuated by the water between the surface and the bottom, with long waves decaying more slowly than those with shorter wavelengths. For example, the pressure signals from long-wavelength tides, with lengths of some 1,000 kilometres and periods of 12 hours or so, reach the floor of even the deep ocean. But the signals from ocean swells 150 metres long and with a 10-second period have lost about 97% of their energy when they arrive at 100 metres depth. And wind-generated surface ripples (10 centimetres long, with a period of less than 1 second) lose 99.99% of their energy in just a few metres of water. Nonetheless, as Farrell and Munk 2  show, these wind-generated, thumbnail-sized ripples on the ocean surface can produce pressure signals that pass through the water column to the sea floor with little attenuation. When two such waves travel in opposite directions on the ocean surface, for instance after a sudden shift in the wind direction, they can interact non-linearly with each other. The result can be the generation of a third wave with half the period of the wind waves, but with a much longer wavelength ( Fig. 1 ). Given that attenuation in the water column decreases with increasing wavelength, the pressure signal from the non-linearly generated long wave can reach the sea floor with little decay. Farrell and Munk 2  demonstrate that non-linear interactions between short (order 1 centimetre wavelength), small (heights of order 1 centimetre) waves travelling in opposite directions on the ocean surface produce waves with long wavelengths of some hundreds of metres. These nonlinear waves create extremely rapid pressure fluctuations, with periods of less than a tenth of a second, that are detectable on the sea floor more than 5 kilometres below the surface. These deep-sea pressure fluctuations are probably common, because winds shift from one direction to another as storms cross the ocean surface. To reach their conclusions, Farrell and Munk combined theoretical work with analysis of observations 3  made over the course of a year with a sea-floor hydrophone at 5.5 kilometres depth near Wake Island in the North Pacific Ocean. Not only do the authors demonstrate that the pressure effects of interacting surface ripples can reach this depth, but their mathematical models also show that the observations suggest a fundamental difference between gravity and capillary waves. Gravity waves are long waves that are caused by gravitational restoring forces when the water surface is displaced, for example by wind. In contrast, capillary waves are so short that the associated curvature of the water surface is restored by surface tensile forces. The fundamental difference between them, proposed by Farrell and Munk, is that their spectral shapes \u2014 that is, the amount of wave energy associated with each wave period or wave frequency,  f  \u2014 decay as  f \u2009 \u22127  (gravity waves) and  f \u2009 \u22123  (capillary waves). The ocean-bottom data suggest that a transition from gravity to capillary waves occurs at periods of about a third of a second. It is remarkable that Farrell and Munk 2  were able to estimate the separation between gravity and capillary waves from measurementsmade more than 5 kilometres below the surface. Although high-frequency 'noise' has been observed in ocean-bottom seismometer records for many years, an explanation was lacking until Farrell and Munk combined non-linear wave theory with careful analysis of a nearly 20-year-old data set. Taking their work further will require other developments, however. Studies 4 , 5 , 6  using extensive arrays of pressure gauges have provided measures of the periods, wavelengths and directions of the 150-metre-wavelength surface swells that cause ocean-bottom microseisms. But that has not been done for short waves. It would be difficult to deploy a sufficiently extensive array of sensors to estimate the distribution of short-wave parameters over the oceanic surface area (estimated at two to three times the water depth 2 ) that contributes to the pressure fluctuations on the sea floor. The array would have to be huge in overall extent yet have sensors spaced at the centimetre scale to detect the wavelengths of interest. Direct verification of Farrell and Munk's hypothesis will thus require innovative observational techniques, perhaps using high-resolution remote sensing of the sea surface combined with bottom-mounted pressure sensors. Meanwhile, even as they stand, their results are remarkable: they explain a complex geophysical phenomenon and will prompt many further studies. Reprints and Permissions"},

Trees grow many times taller \u2014 more than 100 metres in the case of the tallest redwoods. Yet they supply their leaves with a constant flow of water. They achieve this feat by keeping the water high up in their trunks under pressures many atmospheres below that of a vacuum.  Elsewhere in this issue, Wheeler and Stroock report a duplication of this trick: they have created a tiny 'synthetic tree' through whose trunk water flows at pressures of around \u00ac10 atmospheres (T. D. Wheeler and A. D. Stroock  Nature   455 , 208\u2013212; 2008). In trees, evaporation of water from leaf cells called spongy mesophyll pulls water up through hollow cells in the trunk (spongy mesophyll is the tissue in the lower half of this picture, a cross-section through a leaf). The strong, cohesive properties of water, responsible for its powerful surface tension, allow the water to exist at large negative pressures. But even the smallest bubble would explosively expand into the water, disrupting its flow in a process known as cavitation. The interface between the plant's water system and the air, formed by the spongy mesophyll, must allow water to pass, but not the gas molecules that would cause cavitation. To create their tree, Wheeler and Stroock use a hydrogel, which mimics the mesophyll by holding water in molecular-scale pores, smaller than those of other porous solids. As their respective 'root' and 'leaf', the authors formed two networks of channels, 10 micrometres in diameter, in a sheet of poly(hydroxyethyl methacrylate), and connected them by a single channel, the 'trunk'. With the 'root' exposed to a source of water and the 'leaf' to a stream of damp air, water flows through the system powered solely by 'leaf' evaporation. The pressures developed in the trunk are some 15 times more negative than in any previously reported pumping system. The device is shown in Figure 3a of the paper (page 210). It is just 5 centimetres long, and the flow is a little over 2 micrograms of water per second \u2014 but from such small acorns do mighty oaks grow. The synthetic tree can provide a test device for theories of tree physiology and, scaled-up, the technology could find uses in passive pumps or cooling devices \u2014 evaporation makes the 'leaf' a heat sink. Also, the large negative pressures developed might be used to drag water out of even quite dry soils, simultaneously filtering out impurities by passage through the 'root' hydrogel. This process, which the authors dub \u201creverse reverse osmosis\u201d, could form the basis of solar-powered mining of pure water in arid or contaminated environments. Reprints and Permissions"},

On average, the increase in precipitation over this time was 3.5 mm yr \u22121 . In other words, the hydrological cycle intensified, and Martin Wild and his colleagues set themselves the task of investigating the factors responsible (M. Wild, J. Grieser and C. Sch\u00e4r  Geophys. Res. Lett.   35,  L17706, doi:10.1029/2008GL034842; 2008).  The strength of the main engine that powers the hydrological cycle depends on the balance of radiative energy at Earth's surface. That balance in turn depends, first, on the amount of solar radiation absorbed by the surface, and second, on the difference between the amount of thermal radiation being transmitted upwards into the atmosphere (upward radiation) and that being re-radiated back (downward radiation, which is controlled by the greenhouse capacity of the atmosphere). The sum of these fluxes determines the amount of energy that is available for the latent heat of evaporation, which drives precipitation. Any change in these fluxes induces changes in evaporation and precipitation, and thus in the intensity of the hydrological cycle. For their calculations, the authors drew from two sources: the Global Energy Balance Archive and the Baseline Surface Radiation Network. The latter provides more sophisticated data, but started up only in the 1990s. Another consideration in the calculations was the serious but temporary effects on radiation balance of the huge emissions from the 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines, which lasted for several years. After accounting for those effects, Wild  et al . conclude that there has been a steady rise in net surface radiation of 0.2 W m \u22122  yr \u22121  between 1986 and 2000. They mention two possible causes. One is 'solar brightening' \u2014 a rise in surface radiation resulting from a more transparent atmosphere caused by a decrease in anthropogenic aerosols. The other is a more powerful greenhouse effect, increasing downward radiation. As the authors point out, their study cannot provide a truly global picture because of the lack of data from the oceans. But their calculated rise in net surface radiation fits well with the estimate of energy flux required to drive the rise in precipitation.

In the early Holocene (between about 10,000 and 4,500 years ago), monsoon rains created a lush savannah rich in animal and plant life. Complex human societies settled there beside ancient lakes, as demonstrated by a recently reported archaeological site documenting nearly 5,000 years of human occupation (P. C. Sereno  et al .  PLoS ONE   3,  e2995; 2008).  The site, named Gobero and situated in central Niger, contains about 200 burial sites, which, along with several rubbish dumps, provide a record of two distinct periods of human settlement. It was originally occupied 9,500 years ago by a tall, well-muscled people who fished the lake for Nile perch and large catfish with the use of bone harpoons and hooks. These people abandoned the site a little over 8,000 years ago when an extended arid period dried up the lake. Gobero was recolonized 1,000 years later by a slighter and shorter people who ate clams and small catfish from the now much shallower lake, as well as antelope and other vertebrates from the surrounding savannah. This population had sophisticated burial practices involving jewellery and grave goods, and what appear to be ritual poses. One grave, dated to be about 5,300 years old, contained a woman and two children buried together with clasped hands (pictured). Pollen found in this grave suggests that they were buried on a bed of wool flowers ( Celosia ). Occupation of the Gobero site came to an end around 4,500 years ago, when changing climate returned this region to the arid desert conditions that persist to this day. Reprints and Permissions"},

Most notably, the last two of its abdominal segments are pigmented. The equivalent segments in the posterior abdomen of females lack pigment, and sexual dimorphism of this and many other forms is responsible for all sorts of male\u2013female behavioural differences in all sorts of organisms \u2014 vertebrate and invertebrate. Thomas Williams and colleagues have dissected this instance of fruitfly sexual dimorphism in molecular detail to reveal the genetic switch concerned (T. M. Williams  et al .  Cell   134 , 610\u2013623; 2008) .  The pigmentation is regulated by the tandem duplicate  bab  genes, whose protein products repress the enzyme system that produces pigment. The authors' investigations centred on their discovery of two  cis -regulatory elements that respectively control  bab  expression in the anterior and posterior segments, these elements being themselves binding sites for transcription factors. One of the transcription factors is ABD-B, a member of the famed HOX family; two others are forms of the Doublesex protein, one specific for males, the other for females. The sex-specific differences in the posterior segments arise from different control of the  cis -regulatory element. In females, a combination of the transcription factors ABD-B and the female-specific form of Doublesex activates  bab  expression (and so prevents pigmentation). In males, the male-specific form of Doublesex overrides the activating effect of ABD-B:  bab  is repressed, so unleashing the enzyme system that pigments the final two male segments. The most intricate part of the authors' work, however, comes in their studies of the evolution of this switch. From comparisons with transcription-factor binding sites on the equivalent  cis -regulatory element of another species of  Drosophila ,  D. willistoni , they aimed to identify the molecular changes that occurred in the lineage of  D. melanogaster  arising from a putative monomorphic common ancestor. The authors' conclusion is that rather than a wholesale gain of ABD-B or Doublesex binding sites, the advent of male pigmentation was due to a suite of fine-scale changes in the number, polarity and topology of sites. Williams  et al . don't go into the possible evolutionary and ecological factors that drove the production of male pigmentation. Instead, they end with the thought that, in evolutionary history, some of the main differences in the body plans of arthropods, like  Drosophila,  and vertebrates have arisen from alterations in the pattern of gene expression along the principal body axis. Their work, they say, shows a general way in which such expression patterns could evolve through the accumulation of many fine-scale alterations to a gene's  cis -regulatory elements.

Following the complete sequencing of the human genome, we stand at the beginning of an era that promises medical treatments tailored to an individual's genetic make-up. No one is more responsible for this revolution than Victor McKusick, who died on 22 July. McKusick was the first to understand that systematically mapping human genes predisposing the bearer to disease, which many considered no better than stamp-collecting, was a route to a new medicine. In this and other ways he was instrumental in moulding the discipline that we now call genetic medicine, and in making genetics the basic science of medicine. McKusick was born on a dairy farm in Maine in 1921. His early ambition was to enter the ministry. At the age of 15, however, a streptococcal infection of his arm that required a long hospital stay and treatment with one of the first antibiotics, made him rethink his future. His identical twin Vincent chose to study law. Victor, by contrast, after initial education at Tufts University, entered Johns Hopkins University in 1943 to pursue medical training, making a name for himself in cardiology. Like medicine, genetics came to him by chance. His fascination with one teenage patient who suffered from intestinal polyps and melanin spots, and later with three members of a family who exhibited the same syndrome, provided him with first-hand experience of the basic principles of genetics. One was the need to recognize patterns of inheritance, in this case dominant as opposed to recessive, that suggested mutations at one genetic location. Another was the need to distinguish between mechanisms: in these patients, were two genes involved, one for polyps and one for spots, which were co-inherited (linkage), or were polyps and spots different manifestations of the same gene (pleiotropy)? McKusick was thus well armed when he subsequently came across patients with Marfan syndrome \u2014 with its dominant inheritance and remarkable pleiotropy affecting the aorta, eye and skeleton \u2014 which, he argued, arose from mutations in a single gene. Similar patients and their families were to prove pivotal in his conversion to genetics, which was complete by 1957. Asked to direct a chronic-disease clinic by his boss, McKusick argued that \u201cgenetic disease is the ultimate chronic disease, since it's lifelong\u201d, and seized the opportunity to reshape the Moore Clinic at Johns Hopkins to create the first unit devoted to medical genetics. He learnt his trade by doing: by using the rudimentary cytogenetic, biochemical and population (quantitative) genetic methods then available. He soon became convinced of three guiding principles: the value of knowing a gene's location in the human genome; the value of accumulated genetic information; and the value of disseminating this new information widely and rapidly. Given the individual rarity of most hereditary disorders, McKusick knew that he had to learn about the experiences of others and to share his own. He was a prolific organizer, of both ideas and facts, a trait most notably made manifest in 1966 in  Mendelian Inheritance in Man  ( MIM ), the first edition of his catalogue of all known genes and genetic disorders. The final print edition appeared in 1998, but since 1987 it has also been available as full-text online, with a free database ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Omim ). It now has some 19,000 entries, with more than 70% of the content having been produced by McKusick himself. This is his most lasting achievement \u2014 it is a deep resource and knowledge base, without which clinicians and any manner of biologist would be intellectually orphaned. One of McKusick's preoccupations was with cataloguing the location of each human gene associated with a disease, and thus to create a disease map of the human genome. He did this not only through his own pioneering studies, but by beginning \u2014 chiefly with Frank Ruddle \u2014 a series of human gene-mapping workshops. Subsequently, he was an influential voice in organizing the international community around the Human Genome Organization (HUGO, fondly called Victor's HUGO). For him, the  raison d'\u00eatre  of mapping, which he articulated in 1969, well before anyone understood or believed it, was that mapping all human genes was the best way to understand the basic malfunctions causing birth defects. The existence of  MIM,  together with McKusick's mapping preoccupation, were the two most persuasive factors in favour of the public project to sequence the human genome. McKusick himself was on the US National Research Council committee that recommended the project, and was one of its prime cheer-leaders. He was among those who argued for a 'map first, sequence later' approach, and was a supporter of mapping and sequencing other species, and of tackling the whole genome rather than only the known functional genome. As a pragmatist, however, McKusick was also attracted to Craig Venter's idea of sequencing expressed sequence tags (nucleic-acid snippets that encode only a portion of functional genes). He supported both the public sequencing project and Venter's private sequencing effort at Celera (he was a trustee of Venter's eponymous institute), because he believed that the genome could thus be completed sooner. The leaders of both the public and private sequencing ventures (Francis Collins and Venter, respectively) paid their respects at his funeral service. McKusick made research on the human species, despite its poor genetic properties of few offspring and long generation times, a treasure trove for uncovering new genetic mechanisms. He also provided a glimpse of the future for genetic medicine in an interview given in 2001: \u201cI think the medical geneticist will spend much more time overseeing gene screens, or genome screens, interpreting the results to individuals, and designing programs to make the most of the strong points of the genome and to avoid troubles from some of the weak points in the genome.\u201d Spreading the word was a vital part of his legacy \u2014 as for example in the influential 'Short Course' in mammalian genetics, held annually at the Jackson Laboratory in Bar Harbor, Maine, which he founded in 1960 and co-directed. In the long journey to his many accomplishments, Victor McKusick was accompanied by his rheumatologist wife Anne. Those accomplishments are all the more remarkable for having been achieved without his once raising his voice. But then a man who had genetics institutes named after him in Baltimore, Bologna and Beijing had no need to draw attention to himself. Reprints and Permissions"},

This strategy is regulated in part by a feedback loop that controls the secretion of a small subset of bacterial proteins. The bacterium that causes tuberculosis is one of the most successful pathogens. Its spread among humans has been so efficient that as much as one-third of the world's population is now believed to be infected 1 . In most cases, these infections cause clinically silent disease, which is likely to remain permanently dormant unless the host's immunity is substantially compromised. The extraordinary stealth and opportunism that  Mycobacterium tuberculosis  exhibits results from the complex and delicately coordinated way in which it interacts with its host \u2014 a process controlled in part by a specialized bacterial protein-secretion system called ESX-1. On  page 717  of this issue, Raghavan  et al . 2  provide insight into how mycobacteria might maintain ESX-1 activity at just the right level, perhaps allowing these pathogens to avoid excessive virulence so that they can patiently pursue their low-key yet incredibly effective strategy for long-term survival. Mycobacteria lack the specialized type I\u2013VI secretion systems that have been well characterized in Gram-negative bacteria. Instead, their virulence is mediated in part by ESX-1, which is also found in other Gram-positive bacteria. Two proteins secreted by the ESX-1 system, ESAT-6 and CFP-10, are prominent targets of the immune system in animals, including humans, infected with  M. tuberculosis 3 . These proteins are encoded together as part of a coordinated unit of genetic material, the  esxBA  operon. Genomic studies 4  predicted that genes surrounding  esxBA  are likely to encode components of a secretory apparatus responsible for the export of ESAT-6 and CFP-10 out of the bacterial cytoplasm. This prediction was soon validated 5 , 6 , defining ESX-1 as a prototypical virulence-associated mycobacterial protein-secretion system. Exactly how ESX-1 contributes to mycobacterial virulence remains a puzzle, although various observations have led to several hypotheses that are not mutually exclusive. For example, ESX-1 mutants grow poorly during the early phase of infection in mice and in macrophages 6 , 7  (immune cells that engulf pathogens by phagocytosis). Moreover, in infected dendritic cells (another type of phagocytic immune cell), ESX-1 helps  M. tuberculosis  escape from phagosome vesicles \u2014 in which they are captured for destruction \u2014 into the cytoplasm, where they can replicate 8 . Because purified ESAT-6 acts as a membrane-disrupting toxin  in vitro 9 , this protein could directly mediate phagosomal escape. However, ESX-1 also hinders phagosome maturation in macrophages through a process that does not require ESAT-6 or other known substrates secreted by this system 10 . Taken together, these data indicate that ESX-1 modulates innate immune responses of the infected host through several mechanisms, which probably involve ESX-1-mediated secretion of ESAT-6 and other unidentified factors. Raghavan and colleagues 2  identify a previously unknown component of ESX-1 that is not only a central regulator of it but is also secreted by this system. They find that, in  M. tuberculosis , the  Rv3849  gene \u2014 which is located some distance from the main ESX-1 gene cluster surrounding the  esxBA  operon \u2014 is required for ESX-1 function. The protein product of  Rv3849 , EspR, is highly similar to a gene transcription factor of the harmless soil bacterium  Bacillus subtilis . The authors find that EspR is also a DNA-binding transcriptional regulator \u2014  Rv3849  deactivation leads to changes in the transcription of a few operons in the  M. tuberculosis  genome, including the  Rv3616c\u20133612c  cluster, which encodes at least two ESX-1-secreted proteins and is required for the functioning of ESX-1 11  ( Fig. 1 ). Although it is not surprising that mycobacteria express a transcription factor that regulates the expression of ESX-1 components, that EspR is itself secreted by ESX-1 is an unexpected result. The authors propose that secretion of this protein constitutes an unusual feedback loop that could be part of a finely tuned control process to prevent excessive or prolonged activity of ESX-1 during infection of mammalian cells. Although secretion of a regulatory protein as a mechanism for diminishing its activity inside the cell has been described before, EspR might represent the first example of a transcription factor that is actively exported from the cell by the same secretion system that it induces. One can imagine how EspR could impose a limit on the level and duration of ESX-1 activity. When initially expressed, this protein could be essential for activating ESX-1 to secrete high levels of virulence-promoting proteins, thus allowing  M. tuberculosis  to establish its infection in the host. Once infection is achieved, secretion of EspR might lead to a reduction of its transcriptional activity within the bacterium and diminished ESX-1 activity. This would partially attenuate virulence, thus favouring either bacterial persistence or a slow, chronic infection in order to enhance transmission. Can EspR production be turned on or off, and \u2014 if so \u2014 what external stimuli and bacterial sensing and signalling molecules could be responsible for this? Are other components of the ESX-1 system separately regulated by factors distinct from EspR? These questions, together with the identification of other secreted ESX-1 substrates and their mechanisms of action in mammalian host cells, should provide many opportunities for deciphering the unique logic of mycobacterial virulence strategies. It will also be interesting to determine whether EspR has any specific function once it has been exported from the bacterial cell. Because at least two other ESX-1 secreted products \u2014 ESAT-6 and CFP-10 \u2014 are major targets for the immune response, it is possible that EspR is also a prominent mycobacterial antigen. If so, this could have implications for the development of new vaccines and diagnostic tools for tuberculosis. Reprints and Permissions"},

Berger  et al .  Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA  doi:10.1073/pnas.0711988105; 2008 ). The first was an analysis of results from a general election held in Arizona in 2000, the ballot for which included a proposition to raise state sales tax from 5.0% to 5.6%, to increase education spending. Polling stations included churches, schools, community centres and government buildings. Berger  et al . predicted that voting in a school would produce more support for the proposition than voting in other places. Indeed it did, but not by much compared with other documented effects on voter choice such as order on the ballot paper. Nonetheless, the effect persisted through tests for various other confounding factors (for example, the possibility of a consistently different level of voter turnout at school polling locations). The second study was a carefully run online experiment that also involved a proposed tax increase to fund schools. The 'voting environment' was manipulated by exposing participants to typical images of schools or control images. The upshot was the same, with the school images prompting greater (and apparently unconscious) support for the initiative than, for example, an image of an office. All in all, the authors conclude that what they call contextual priming of polling location affects how people vote. They reasonably wonder whether such factors could, for example, influence voting in a church on such matters as gay marriage and stem-cell research. But here's a thought. In the event of science spending being on the political agenda, why not offer the lab as a polling station?

Sir John Templeton, who died on 8 July at the age of 95, was one of the most modest billionaires you could hope to meet. I interviewed him once, when he was visiting England to talk to Prince Philip \u2014 in a small stuffy room at the top of a small stuffy club on Green Park, London, where he was staying because he liked it. He could have bought the Ritz next door without noticing, but that would have been extravagant. He would have thought it wrong. He was prepared to spend billions on his causes, but never a penny more than he thought was needed to get the job done. The job that needed doing, he thought, was to recognize the spiritual aspects of the world as quite as real, as reliable and as worth studying as anything else that science can examine. He would say that he wanted from his philanthropy \u201cnew spiritual information\u201d. This is a belief that some atheists and many religious believers \u2014 especially those who see in modern science a conspiracy against revealed truth \u2014 find laughable or sinister. If I defend it, I will certainly be accused of an interest in the matter, as I have taken Templeton money twice, once as the first winner of his prize for European religious journalism, and once as one of his journalistic scholars of science and religion for two months. But money is actually the least that anyone invests in the question. Whether or not you believe that the facts of the world are wholly amoral will shape everything about your life. It doesn't, of course, follow that anyone who believes the world is amoral must themselves feel compelled to amorality. You can perfectly well suppose that humans should be good in an amoral world, and you may even suppose that humans should be religious in such a world. But this will always feel arbitrary, false to the facts, not on the winning side. Conversely, if you believe, with Templeton, that virtue is rewarded, and that a patient, honest exploration of the Universe will reveal spiritual values, you may not want to subscribe to any organized religion, but you will certainly suppose that goodness is the right and natural condition of our lives and that it is evil that demands an explanation. That kind of optimism was one of the things the whole world loved about the United States in the 1950s and 1960s, when Templeton was making his fortune on Wall Street ($10,000 invested with his main fund in 1954 would have grown to $2 million when he sold out in 1992, netting him a personal profit of $440 million; by that time his total funds were worth $13 billion). All of this was earned from nothing. He was born in 1912 in a small town in Tennessee, 100 kilometres from Dayton, where the 'Scopes monkey trial', which tested the law forbidding the teaching of evolution, was held; in later life he would boast that he had known John Scopes after the trial. His father was a lawyer who lost most of his money in the Depression; the family were devout Presbyterians, as Sir John remained throughout his life. From Yale, he won a Rhodes scholarship to the University of Oxford, which seems to have given him a lifelong case of Anglophilia: in 1968 he renounced his American citizenship to become a British subject and moved to the Bahamas. He was knighted in 1987. His first wife, with whom he had three children, died in a bicycling accident in 1951; he remarried in 1958, but outlived his second wife too. His first notable act of philanthropy was to set up an annual prize for \u201cProgress in Religion\u201d which he stipulated should be bigger than the Nobel prizes, thus proving to vulgar materialists that the spiritual mattered. The first recipient was Mother Teresa of Calcutta, in 1973, to whom he gave $85,000 (the prize is now worth well over $1 million) \u2014 not a woman one could accuse of progress in theology but she certainly got things done, and this appealed greatly to Templeton's distinctive combination of pragmatism and energetic optimism. More recent winners have tended to be scientists with an interest in the metaphysical, among them Freeman Dyson and John Polkinghorne. Templeton was sure that in the moral and spiritual realm there could be facts of the matter, and that science could find them. He didn't believe in a literal heaven or hell, or a Garden of Eden, but he was certain that these stories were records of encounters with aspects of reality that demand explanation. He would open the meetings of his fund with a prayer, not because he wanted God to reward them but because he believed that prayer cleared the mind and led to better decisions, even if he could not know why. He would not have been in the least bit disconcerted by the celebrated Templeton-funded experiment on the effects of intercessory prayer on a large sample of heart patients, which showed only that patients who knew they were being prayed for had slightly worse outcomes. In 1987, he set up a foundation for research into what he liked to call the really big questions. Now with an endowment of $1.5 billion, it has funded an enormous range of research, from cosmology to the cognitive roots of religious belief, and is credited with founding the field of forgiveness research \u2014 the effect forgiveness may have on a subject's physical health and well-being \u2014 by careful pump-priming funding. The list of moral qualities that he thought science should be looking at was entirely characteristic of the man: \u201cethics, love, honesty, generosity, thanksgiving, forgiving, reliability, entrepreneurship, diligence, thrift, joy, future-mindedness, beneficial purpose, creativity, curiosity, humility, and awe.\u201d This is slightly absurd, but at the same time noble. The world would be better off with more of all these things, and he wanted science, with his money, to study them, because he never for a moment doubted that virtues were as real as quarks. He really deserved the title of philanthropist. See also Editorial,  page 253 \n . Reprints and Permissions"},

In the first place, a black core was observed running medially through the length of the shadowy band which then encircled the planet. This core...is presumed to be the black shadow of the plane ring A bordered by the particles of the rings B and C scattered above and below the plane of A. That is to say, the rings B and C differ from A in being tores and not flat rings... The assumed heaping up of the particles, as indicated by the agglomerations [seen at many observatories], is in accordance with gravitational laws. Furthermore, it is shown from the observational results that the inevitable disintegration of the rings is in the process of taking place. From  Nature  25 June 1908. Reprints and Permissions"},

A dramatic example is described by Amir Grosman and colleagues who studied behavioural changes induced in the Brazilian geometrid moth  Thyrinteina leucocerae  by a braconid parasitic wasp of the genus  Glyptapanteles  (A. H. Grosman  et al .  PLoS ONE   3 , e2276; 2008). The wasp lays up to 80 eggs in a moth caterpillar, where they hatch, grow and then exit to form pupae on nearby leaves three weeks later. At this point the caterpillar ceases its previous activity, and instead stands guard over the wasp pupae (pictured). While 'guarding' the pupae, caterpillars make violent swings of their heads towards any passing insect or other potential threat. Grosman  et al . show that this behaviour is a direct result of parasite infestation and profits the wasp. Unlike the parasitized caterpillars, their unparasitized siblings failed to take up sentry duty when placed by wasp pupae, continuing to feed as normal. Also, the head butts of parasitized caterpillars proved effective protection for the pupae, repelling nearly half of the attacks by predatory stinkbugs ( Supputius cincticeps ) in the laboratory. Such behaviour has no fitness advantage for the caterpillars, who die soon after the adult wasps emerge from the pupae. But the wasps profit hugely, the presence of a guarding caterpillar almost halving the mortality of pupae in field experiments. Although the mechanism by which these parasites influence their hosts is not clear, live wasp larvae were found in the bodies of caterpillars even after their broodmates had departed. Such 'brain worms' have also been seen with trematode and liver fluke parasites that modify the behaviour of their ant hosts. Reprints and Permissions"},

With the death of Chris Curtis on 13 May, the world has lost a leading researcher of insect-borne diseases. A respected theoretical scientist, he was also a pioneer of research into genetic control of disease-carrying insects. But Curtis will probably be best remembered for his innovative contributions to the control of the  Anopheles  mosquito, the vector for the malaria parasite. He was born in Surrey, UK, and studied at the universities of Oxford and Edinburgh. Early in his research career, he became interested in genetic control of infectious diseases. An example is his seminal work on tsetse flies, the vectors of parasitic African trypanosomes, which, among other diseases, cause sleeping sickness. Curtis used mutation by chromosomal translocation to sterilize these insects, with the idea that they could outcompete the wild, infectious population without the need for radiation or chemical agents. His interest in genetic approaches continued when he moved to India to work for the World Heath Organization (WHO), and he was part of the team that developed sterile male  Culex  and  Aedes  mosquitoes. Curtis returned to England in 1976 to take a post in the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, where he found the ambience for research and teaching so ideal that he stayed until his retirement. By the 1980s, he began to realize that genetic approaches were not immediately applicable, and so he focused on practical technologies that would benefit the health of people in developing countries. In Zanzibar, for example, he demonstrated a low-cost way to control  Culex  mosquitoes, which transmit the parasitic worms responsible for the disfiguring disease filariasis, and the viruses causing West Nile fever and Japanese encephalitis. These mosquitoes survive in pit latrines and soakage pits even after spraying with insecticides. Curtis and colleagues showed that expanded polystyrene beads can form a self-sealing layer on the surface of the water that suffocates the  Culex  larvae, and that a single application of these beads to a pit prevents mosquito breeding for more than seven years. Later, this simple method was used effectively for mosquito control in India, where soakage pits are common sites for mosquito breeding. Curtis was also an influential figure in the field of malaria management, and the various methods he developed are now considered routine for both intervention and evaluation of Anopheles control. In his opinion, the available knowledge in the 1990s of the biology of malaria vectors was sufficient to craft new and affordable malaria control technologies for developing countries, where annual public health budgets were and may still be as meagre as the US$10 per person estimated in 2000. He was a strong proponent of the use of insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) to cover beds for malaria control, as  Anopheles  mosquitoes bite mainly at night. In collaboration with the National Institute for Medical Research Tanzania, he demonstrated that ITNs are as effective as indoor insecticide sprays for preventing malaria, making these nets central to global malaria control. He also promoted the idea that there can be a 'mass effect' on the mosquito population when everyone in a village \u2014 rather than just the vulnerable groups such as pregnant women and children \u2014 uses bednets, and that extensive use of ITNs will lead to substantial community protection. His studies influenced donors and governments. Together with two other campaigners, Awash Teklehaimanot and Jeffrey Sachs, Curtis made a call this year for mass distribution of free, long-lasting ITNs \u2014 rather than their allocation through social marketing, whereby each net is sold for US$1\u20132 \u2014 to reduce the burden of malaria. They calculated that an investment of US$3 billion per year, combined with sound public-health measures, would achieve comprehensive malaria control in Africa by 2010. Another important public health lesson was learnt when Curtis and his colleagues suggested that infections can be spread by mosquitoes carried from 'malaria zones' by aeroplanes, thus emphasizing the need for 'disinsection' of air transport. Curtis continued to investigate genetic approaches to control mosquito populations, but was concerned that the time taken to overcome the hurdles associated with introducing genetically modified insects into the environment would lead to loss of more lives. Indeed, he argued that the current excitement in genomics must be de-emphasized, as far as practical ends are concerned, and that the choice of a molecular method \u201cshould be dictated by its being the best way to solve an existing problem\u201d and not by its being the most modern approach. Genetically engineered  Anopheles  strains that cannot transmit malaria would require extremely reliable systems to drive the transgene through the wild population, and that is aside from overcoming objections from society. His other concern was that the better drugs and insecticides designed through genomic approaches would be patent-protected and so too expensive for the poorer nations. The influence exercised by Curtis, and his achievements, were the result of sound science and meticulous data acquisition. Even in his hobbies he showed that one can have fun while applying scientific rigour. For example, primrose populations were thought to consist of equal numbers of two morphs, but in 1940 the botanist J. Crosby identified a third, self-pollinating, morph \u2014 the homostyle \u2014 in a Somerset wood and predicted that it would increase over time. Along with his wife Jill, Curtis painstakingly identified and counted primroses of every morph in Somerset to see whether there was a variation in their numbers and distribution over 40 years; they published their findings in the journal  Heredity . Chris Curtis will be equally remembered as an inspirational and tireless educator. He was generous as a reviewer of scientific manuscripts, providing extensive suggestions for improving the clarity of manuscripts written by those less skilful in their use of English. An iconic figure for those implementing low-cost vector-control measures, he influenced generations of MSc and PhD students from many countries who now occupy prominent positions. His \u201cSo what?\u201d test for new developments and \u201cDon't get it right, get it written!\u201d \u2014 his cure for writer's block \u2014 became universal lessons for young researchers. Even though he retired five years ago, he continued teaching and was conducting a five-week vector-control course when he fell ill. He leaves behind his wife Jill and a large community of students and colleagues around the world. My memory is of him in his London laboratory, writing with one hand and providing a blood feed to a beaker full of mosquitoes with the other. Reprints and Permissions"},

Dowling"}], "parsed_as_year": "2006_or_before", "body": "Fifteen-year oscillations in Saturn's equatorial stratosphere bear a striking resemblance to the shorter-term oscillations seen on Earth and Jupiter \u2014 akin to notes played on a cello, a violin and a viola. Planetary lower atmospheres \u2014 the tropospheres \u2014 are clamorous. If, in addition to sound waves, one could hear buoyancy waves, which have periods measured in minutes, and vorticity waves, which have periods measured in days, the effect would be a deafening cacophony of enormous range. Time series of atmospheric data reveal a surprising response to this tropospheric din: the overlying stratospheres are answering back, and playing the deepest notes of all. Studies by Orton  et al . 1  and Fouchet  et al . 2  ( pages 196  and  200  of this issue) reveal that Saturn's equatorial stratosphere exhibits a 15-year oscillation in wind direction and temperature that is remarkably similar in structure to 2-year and 4-year oscillations in the stratospheres of Earth and Jupiter, respectively. Considering that a stratosphere is like a complicated sound box attached to the elaborate musical instrument that is the troposphere, this discovery is like listening to notes played on three random orchestral instruments and finding that they all are from the string section \u2014 and perhaps all from the same instrument. Stratospheres are so named because they resist convective forces and so are comparatively stable. They form because the transmission of thermal infrared radiation to space by participating molecules (greenhouse gases) becomes efficient for pressures of 200\u2013100 hectopascals and lower (1 hPa = 1 millibar; pressure, of course, decreases with height). Each of the seven stratospheres in the Solar System \u2014 those of Venus, Earth, Jupiter, Saturn, Titan, Uranus and Neptune \u2014 has its bottom, the boundary with the troposphere known as the tropopause, at approximately 100 hPa. (The other four atmospheres, those of Mars, Io, Triton and Pluto, have surface pressures significantly less than 100 hPa.) In terms of waves, the tropopause plays much the same part as the bridge on a violin or cello ( Fig. 1 ), and its consistent placement near 100 hPa marks a pivot point for comparative planetology. Orton  et al . 1  analysed more than two decades' worth of observations from NASA's ground-based Infrared Telescope Facility (IRTF), focusing on wavelengths that are sensitive to methane and ethane emissions, which are diagnostic of stratospheric temperatures. A 14.8\u00b11.2-year oscillation stands out clearly in their time series. Fouchet  et al . 2  used the Cassini spacecraft's Composite Infrared Spectrometer (CIRS) to obtain thermal spectra from Saturn's limb \u2014 the edge of the planet where the line of sight passes through the most atmospheric mass, yielding high vertical resolution for the upper stratosphere. Their observations reveal the vertical structure of this oscillation, showing alternate bands of eastward and westward winds from an altitude of 0.2 hPa down to 5 hPa. There are two terrestrial candidates as analogues to Saturn's 15-year signal, the quasi-biennial oscillation 3  (QBO) and the semiannual oscillation 4 . The QBO has a mean period of 28 months, during which time the direction of the jet stream at a given altitude in Earth's equatorial stratosphere switches from eastward to westward and back again, alternating with time, just as is now seen on Saturn. The mechanism driving the QBO is more complicated than the ratcheting friction between bow and violin string, but it is not more complicated than the trials and tribulations of everyday life. Imagine a father trying to retrieve two (or more) rambunctious toddlers from a tall climbing frame. He clambers up the west side to coax down tot no. 1, blocking all the other kids' access on that side in the process. Meanwhile, tot no. 2 scrambles up the east side. Dad plants tot no. 1 on the ground, and heads up the east side to retrieve tot no. 2, while tot no. 1 breezes back up the west side. When dad and tot no. 2 return to the bottom, one full cycle is complete. Of course, no self-respecting parent would put up with this nonsense, but what jet streams lack in intelligence, they make up in perseverance. In fact, the troposphere is a playground for a large array of westward- and eastward-propagating waves that are constantly clambering up into the stratosphere. Forty years ago, this was recognized 5  as being key to the QBO mechanism. Each type of wave has a different personality. Buoyancy waves (internal gravity waves) travel in all directions; they are just like the waves on the ocean, but internal to the atmosphere. Near the equator, the vorticity waves (Rossby waves) travel slowly westward. In addition, there is a class of 'half waves' (equatorial Kelvin waves) that lean against each other across the equator; they travel rapidly eastward. When any of these waves drifts upwards and encounters a stratospheric jet going in the same direction, it deposits its momentum just shy of the jet maximum, which has the effect of coaxing the jet downwards in a slow but continuous manner; this led to the first complete description 6  of the QBO mechanism. Meanwhile, waves that travel in the opposite direction are not blocked but can scramble all the way to the top of the climbing frame, thereby starting a new jet in their direction, which then slowly descends. The upshot is that the roughly 2-year period of the QBO on Earth is governed more by the strength of the wave flux, and the size and shape of the stratosphere, than by the rate of rotation or revolution of the planet. Significantly, Jupiter also exhibits a QBO-like oscillation, with a period of 4.5 (Earth) years, appropriately called the QQO (quasi-quadrennial oscillation) 7 . As described by Fouchet  et al . 2 , similarities between Saturn's 15-year oscillations and the QBO/QQO include strong equatorial confinement of temperature extremes; asymmetry between the eastward and westward wind shears, with stronger eastward shears; and out-of-phase temperature changes between the equator and 15\u201320\u00b0 latitude. My guess is that the lengthening of the period from Earth to Jupiter to Saturn relates to their decreasing proximity to the Sun, which reduces the total energy budget available to their waves. But watch out: in addition to the QBO, Earth's stratosphere exhibits a strong signal with a 0.5-year period; this is the semiannual oscillation (SAO) mentioned earlier (Mars also seems to show an SAO 8 ). The Saturn year is 29.5 Earth years, meaning that the Saturn wave is, at least descriptively, an SAO (for comparison, the corresponding time ratio for Jupiter's QQO is 4.5/11.9 = 0.38, which is not semiannual). Whereas Earth's SAO is driven by the different response to surface heating between the ice of Antarctica and the surrounding ocean, it is not obvious what the analogy is on Saturn (although its large ring shadow probably has a role). The influence of the QBO and SAO on Earth's weather cannot be overstated. They modulate seasonal activity, the behaviour of the Hadley cell (the overturning circulation that predominates in the tropics), the strength of the polar vortex, the mixing of atmospheric trace species, and even the predictability of regional patterns such as the Indian monsoon in August and September 9 . Because the portfolio of eastward waves is distinct from that of westward waves, the eastward and westward phases of the QBO are different. The big news is that this asymmetrical, long-period response has now been observed in the stratospheres of three planets. The question for modellers is whether these stratospheres are like three different string instruments, or are more like three of the same instruments being played differently.

So at least we are told at school. Detailed calculations lead to a heretical conclusion \u2014 those variable charge states are a myth. The idea of electric charge 'belonging' to a given atom or ion has been a central one ever since Michael Faraday, studying the use of electric current to decompose ionic compounds, published his laws of electrolysis in 1832. The charge that passes between two electrodes can be measured; it is always an integer multiple of the basic electronic charge; and it is proportional to the number of atoms exchanged. At the root of this effect is a basic quantization phenomenon 1  of the kind that still exercises physicists investigating, for example, the quantum Hall effect 2 . Both electrolysis and the quantum Hall effect deal with charges in transit. But when instead we address the static charges belonging to atoms in compounds, no such quantization theorem can be invoked. Such charges seem arbitrarily defined: the charges one gets are non-integer, and cannot be reliably measured. So what is the relationship between these static charges and 'oxidation states' \u2014 the formal states of integer charge that today underlie our ideas of electrolysis and much else in chemistry? On  page 763  of this issue, Raebiger, Lany and Zunger 3  address this question in transition metals, which are notable for having more than one stable oxidation state. Their answer? There is no connection: a change in the oxidation state of a transition-metal atom occurs without noticeable change in its net physical charge. The authors provide a consummately elegant explanation for this finding as the consequence of a feedback mechanism that leads the charge on the transition-metal atom to regulate itself. Furthermore, they show that this mechanism is present in both semiconducting and ionic host materials. The concept of atomic oxidation states was introduced by the American chemist Wendell Latimer in 1938. It is undoubtedly useful for bookkeeping in chemical reactions involving molecules, crystals or liquids. An agreed set of rules 4  is used to attribute an integer oxidation state to all the atoms of a given compound. This oxidation state corresponds to the charge (in units of electronic charge) that an atom would have if its bonds were entirely ionic. In reality, when two nearest-neighbour atoms are of different species, their bond is neither entirely ionic nor entirely covalent. It is thus misleading, and a little dangerous, to attribute any physical meaning to the Coulomb energy ascribed to an atomic point charge by its oxidation state. Even in the archetypal ionic crystal, sodium chloride, a change in oxidation state of 1 exaggerates the physical charge transfer between atoms of the two species, which is between around 0.7 and 0.8 (ref.  1 ). Further away from the extreme ionic limit, where the character of bonds between different atomic species is strongly covalent, characterized by the sharing rather than the swapping of electrons, this disparity becomes even greater. For transition-metal atoms, covalence is important even in bonds to significantly electronegative species such as oxygen, where ionic bonding would be expected to dominate 5 . Raebiger  et al . 3  perform a series of first-principle calculations of the charges on single transition-metal atoms embedded in a large semiconducting or ionic matrix. They consider different occupation states for transition-metal energy levels that sit in the band gap of the surrounding matrix structure \u2014 that is, in an energy range where the matrix itself has no allowed energy levels. This configuration allows the oxidation state of the transition metal to be varied while changing (almost) nothing else. Because the bonds formed by transition-metal atoms are always partly covalent, the energy levels of the transition metal and its partner in the bonding are strongly hybridized. The hybridization of transition-metal and oxygen energy levels has been thoroughly investigated. In the class of compound oxides known as perovskites, hybridization is largely responsible for their characteristic 'ferroelectricity' \u2014 their spontaneous polarization even in the absence of an electric field 5 , 6 . Quite generally, covalence creates what amounts to a constructive interference between the quantum wavefunctions of the partner atoms. In Raebiger and colleagues' simulations, interference between the wavefunctions of the transition metal and the surrounding atoms contributes to a net atomic charge around the transition-metal atom. The authors explain their core finding \u2014 that the net physical charge belonging to a transition-metal atom is essentially independent of its oxidation state \u2014 with the following feedback mechanism. Suppose we wish to add an electron to the transition-metal atom, and thus change its oxidation state; then, unavoidably, the hybridization of its energy levels with those of its partner atom changes. This change always has the effect of displacing some negative charge away from the transition metal; the extra charge flows away and is spread over a large region, and the net physical charge belonging to the transition-metal atom within the structure stays essentially constant. The charge transfers associated with changes in oxidation states have often been considered as a first approximation to the physical, ionic charge of a transition-metal atom, with covalent hybridization accounting for just a small correction to it. Raebiger  et al . show 3  otherwise: charge self-regulation, rather than charge transfer, is the appropriate model. Different oxidation states of the same transition-metal atom have distinct 'ionic radii' and distinct signatures, such as shifts in the X-ray light emitted from their core levels. These features must now be reconsidered in terms of the degree of hybridization, not the net physical charge at the transition-metal site. Knowledge of the electron density alone is not enough to address such subtleties; the full quantum-mechanical density matrix must be analysed instead. Tools devised to this end include charge-and-bond-order analysis and the electron localization function 7 , 8 . By applying such tools, we can hope to achieve an understanding of transition-metal bonding in different oxidation states that is finally on a sound theoretical footing. Reprints and Permissions"},

The fertile imagination of John Archibald Wheeler, who died on 13 April aged 96, roamed from the properties of atomic nuclei to the physics of nuclear explosions; from the quantum mechanics of exotic atoms to the philosophy of quantum measurements; and from the nature of black holes to the properties of space-time. The thread connecting these disparate areas was Wheeler's love of acquiring and imparting knowledge. Nowhere was that more evident than with the science of gravity, which Wheeler and his students \u2014 many of them themselves future leaders \u2014 took from a theoretical backwater to a vigorous area of scientific enquiry. Wheeler loved 'what if' questions. What happens if electrons and their antiparticles, positrons, bubble up from the vacuum and cause light to be scattered by light? In 1934, just two years after the positron was discovered, Wheeler and Gregory Breit worked out the answer. Their work is still used to describe the scattering of energetic photons from distant galaxies. What if you replace the proton in a hydrogen atom by a positron, or the electron in an atom by a muon, its heavier cousin? Wheeler found that out in the 1940s. What if electrons and positrons are in fact the same particle, travelling in opposite directions in time? He put this question to his graduate student, Richard Feynman; it led to Feynman's powerful diagrammatic approach to quantum electrodynamics. In 1939, nuclear fission was discovered. Wheeler, then at the start of a tenure of almost 40 years at Princeton University, collaborated with Niels Bohr to deliver an underlying theory. Soon after that, war broke out. Wheeler willingly went to work first on the American atomic bomb, and later the hydrogen bomb. He was a complex person: a patriot, he was offended by criticism of US military policy, for example in Vietnam. But he also encouraged one of us, Bill Unruh, to go to the University of California, Berkeley \u2014 he said that the many protests there at the time made it a stimulating place to work. In 1952, Wheeler turned his attention to gravity. Could the malleable space-time of Einstein's general theory of relativity explain the characteristics of elementary particles? Wheeler's mantras, \u201ccharge without charge\u201d, \u201cmass without mass\u201d and \u201ctopology is too important to be left to the mathematicians\u201d, shocked and inspired others to draw out the physical implications of the theory. The rich harvest of physics and mathematics was displayed in the monumental treatise  Gravitation , written with two former students of his, Charles Misner and Kip Thorne. First published in 1973, it has not been out of print since. One problem emphasized by the book was that of singularities. When a massive star exhausts its supply of nuclear fuel, it can collapse first to a 'black hole' \u2014 as Wheeler named it \u2014 and within that into a singularity where space and time cease to exist. As  Gravitation  was being published, another of Wheeler's students, Jacob Bekenstein, argued that black holes have thermodynamic properties such as energy and entropy. Three years later, Stephen Hawking showed that they have a temperature, emit radiation at that temperature, and so can evaporate. The strong observational evidence for black holes keeps Wheeler's fundamental questions alive \u2014 what is the meaning of a singularity; what is left after a black hole evaporates; what happens to information that is swallowed by a black hole. Besides gravity, quantum mechanics was Wheeler's passion: \u201cWhy the quantum?\u201d was another favourite question. He was especially fascinated by the idea that whether, looking at light, you see wave or particle behaviour depends on what experiment you perform. In a famous thought experiment, Wheeler considered what happened if the choice of experiment could be delayed until, assuming causality, it was too late for the decision to affect the way the light behaves. The experiment has since been done, and it starkly displays the situation. In Wheeler's words, \u201cWe have a strange inversion of the normal order of time. We, now, by moving the mirror in or out, have a right to change what we say about the already past history of that photon.\u201d As a logical extension, Wheeler went on to ask whether our present experiments influence what we can say of the Universe in the distant past. Does the observer even in some way participate in the birth of the Universe? Wheeler had no fear of such 'hard' questions. He infected others with his own intellectual courage, emboldening Hugh Everett, another of his doctoral students, to present his thesis positing the 'many worlds' interpretation of quantum mechanics, despite his, Wheeler's, own philosophical discomfort with it. John Wheeler was an exuberant person. He happened to be in the office of one of us, Jim Peebles, when a student, Dan, came in with his new dissertation. John: What's it about? Dan: A search for correlations of position angles of galaxies. John: G\u00f6del would be interested. Dan: Who's G\u00f6del? John: To say G\u00f6del is the greatest logician since Aristotle would be to slight G\u00f6del. John picked up the phone, got G\u00f6del on the line, and handed the phone to Dan. We don't know what G\u00f6del made of this call (he had discovered a rotating-universe model), but John had got to do what he loved best: inspire a young person. The rotation of galaxies. What G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorem had to do with physics. The end of space-time. John Wheeler's eclectic passions are remote from the practical problems of society. But to him, fundamental scientific research was both a pleasure and a duty. His attitude was summed up in the dedication of  Gravitation : \n               To our fellow citizens \n             \n               Who, for love of truth, \n             \n               Take from their own wants \n             \n               By taxes and gifts, \n             \n               And now and then send forth \n             \n               One of themselves \n             \n               As a dedicated servant, \n             \n               To forward the search \n             \n               Into the mysteries and marvelous simplicities \n             \n               Of this strange and beautiful universe, \n             \n               Our home. \n             Reprints and Permissions"},

Zooming in on the enzyme's molecular interactions provides tantalizing clues. To replicate within their host cell, retroviruses such as HIV must make a double-stranded DNA copy of their single-stranded RNA genome. This elegant process, by which a viral enzyme \u2014 reverse transcriptase \u2014 synthesizes some 20,000 nucleotides, with the flow of genetic information moving in the opposite direction to normal (DNA to RNA), is nothing short of amazing. It also provides numerous opportunities for therapeutic intervention, as reverse transcriptase is the target of nearly half of the drugs approved for treating AIDS. But reverse transcription is not simple, for the enzyme comes into contact with diverse nucleic-acid substrates (DNA and/or RNA). On  page 184  of this issue, Abbondanzieri  et al . 1  describe how this enzyme discriminates between substrates at intermediate steps of reverse transcription. Reverse transcriptase has two distinct enzymatic activities: it is a DNA polymerase capable of copying either an RNA or a DNA template into a complementary DNA sequence; and it is an RNase H, capable of degrading the RNA strand of an RNA\u2013DNA duplex into small pieces once it has been used as a template for the first DNA strand (called the 'minus' strand;  Fig. 1 ). But the enzyme overlooks some RNA segments, called polypurine tracts (PPTs), sparing them from degradation; these segments have an unusual sequence (and so structure), which prevents the enzyme's RNase H domain from cutting them 2 . Like other DNA polymerase enzymes, reverse transcriptases initiate DNA synthesis using short nucleic-acid segments called primers. The primer used by HIV reverse transcriptase to generate the minus-strand DNA is a host-cell transfer RNA sequence. For the formation of the second (plus) DNA strand, which is complementary to the minus strand, the enzyme uses PPT segments that it has generated by cleaving the template RNA on both sides of these fragments ( Fig. 1b ). The molecular details of the interactions between HIV reverse transcriptase and its various substrates have been revealed through structural analyses of the enzyme when in complex with nucleic acids (DNA\u2013DNA or RNA\u2013DNA strands) 2 , 3 . They have also been studied by analyses of nucleic acids (DNA\u2013DNA) in the presence of dNTPs (the incoming free nucleosides that join and extend a nucleic acid) 4 . Together with complementary biochemical studies, these structures showed that reverse transcriptase interacts with both nucleic acids and the incoming dNTPs when in the polymerization mode, with its polymerase active site aligned at one end (the 3\u2032 end) of a primer. When in the RNA-cleavage mode, it interacts with RNA\u2013DNA, with the active site of the RNase H domain aligned with the RNA strand 2  ( Fig. 1 ). A remaining puzzle has been how reverse transcriptase can distinguish PPT RNA, as an efficient primer for the initiation of second-strand-DNA synthesis, from the rest of the RNA sequence, which, having already been used as a template, is cleaved by RNase H. Abbondanzieri  et al . 1  present fascinating clues about the interactions between HIV reverse transcriptase and various nucleic-acid substrates. To determine the orientation in which individual enzyme molecules bind to an RNA\u2013DNA hybrid, the authors used the technique of fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET). Typical biochemical experiments involve analysing populations of molecules or complexes. By contrast, single-molecule spectroscopy techniques such as FRET allow direct, time-dependent observation of individual molecular events. For FRET analysis, two molecules of interest \u2014 in this case, reverse transcriptase and the nucleic acid \u2014 are labelled with fluorescent chemical groups, and the transfer of light energy from one molecule to the other, which depends on the distance between them, is used as a measure of their interactions. The authors find that, when reverse transcriptase binds to a nucleic acid in which a relatively short RNA segment is hybridized to a longer DNA strand (mimicking the binding of a random primer to the minus-strand DNA), this enzyme binds almost exclusively in an RNase H cleavage mode, and the active site of the polymerase domain does not bind to the 3\u2032 end of the RNA to extend this sequence. But if the RNA is the PPT primer, a portion of the reverse transcriptase binds to it in a polymerase-competent orientation, with the 3\u2032 end of PPT available for extension by the polymerase active site ( Fig. 2 ). Abbondanzieri and colleagues also show that, in the presence of dNTPs, the number of reverse transcriptase molecules that bind to the PPT primer in the polymerase-competent orientation increases. Moreover, if a short DNA primer is bound to the longer DNA template, most reverse transcriptase enzymes bind in the polymerase-competent orientation. These results indicate that the PPT sequence 'design' is such that not only does it avoid degradation, but it is also an efficient primer for the initiation of second-strand DNA synthesis. Remarkably, HIV reverse transcriptase can 'flip' its orientation on a nucleic-acid substrate without dissociating from it 1 . Such a transition between two binding orientations is unexpected, given the extensive contacts between this enzyme and its nucleic-acid substrate. The authors also find that an incoming dNTP substrate can bind to a reverse transcriptase in complex with a template\u2013primer duplex (which lacks a hydroxyl group in the 3\u2032 end of the primer to prevent dNTP incorporation), thereby stabilizing the polymerase-competent orientation of reverse transcriptase. Formation of such a 'dead-end' complex has previously been reported 5  to prevent a reaction that unblocks chain-terminated primers and to increase the efficacy of some chain-terminating drugs that target HIV reverse transcriptase. The authors have made another intriguing observation: the drug nevirapine \u2014 an inhibitor of HIV reverse transcriptase that binds in a pocket at the base of the flexible 'thumb' subdomain of the enzyme ( Fig. 2a ) \u2014 allows the enzyme to flip more rapidly. Nevirapine binding forces the thumb subdomain to undergo a conformational change that Abbondanzieri  et al . propose relaxes the enzyme's grip on the nucleic-acid substrate, thus allowing it to switch orientations more rapidly. This observation implies that certain steps in the process of reverse transcription may be particularly susceptible to antiviral treatments \u2014 an idea that has also been proposed previously 6 , 7 . Abbondanzieri and colleagues' work vividly illustrates the importance of understanding how the orientational dynamics of reverse transcriptase relate to the enzyme's activities. Their findings also raise the question of whether similar surprises are in store with regard to the enzyme's interactions with the host tRNA, during the initiation of minus-strand-DNA synthesis. Another question is whether other multifunctional enzymes indulge in similar molecular acrobatics. Examples of such enzymes are DNA polymerases, which, like reverse transcriptases, have separate non-polymerase activities, or enzymes that interact with nucleic acids, such as helicases, ligases, topoisomerases, integrases and restriction endonucleases. Whatever the answers, this work suggests that reverse transcriptase is even more agile in its handling of nucleic acids than we thought. Reprints and Permissions"},

Their repertoire could be expanded by a method that allows artificial enzymes to be made from scratch. Enzymes are astoundingly good catalysts: they allow reactions to occur billions of times faster than would be possible without them, at temperatures much lower than those required by typical synthetic catalysts. But enzymes have evolved to accelerate only biological reactions, under the narrow set of conditions that are compatible with life. Two papers from the same group, one in this issue (R\u00f6thlisberger  et al . 1 ,  page 190 ) and another in  Science  (Jiang  et al . 2 ), show how these limitations can be overcome. They describe a method for designing enzymes that catalyse unnatural reactions, and demonstrate its use for two different chemical transformations. Enzymes work by lowering the activation energy of reactions, specifically by confining substrates in binding sites that stabilize the highest-energy arrangement of atoms in the reaction pathway (known as the transition state). They also shield the reactants, thus preventing possible side reactions. The idea behind the latest work 1 , 2  is simple \u2014 model the transition state for a reaction, stabilize it by surrounding it with carefully placed chemical groups, graft the resulting active site into an existing protein and then alter the amino-acid sequence of the protein to accommodate the changes. In practice, this is a complicated procedure. For starters, building an accurate model of a transition state requires a detailed understanding of the reaction's mechanism, which isn't always available. Furthermore, transition states are modelled using quantum-mechanical calculations, but currently available methods can handle only a limited number of atoms, and are often inadequate for modelling enzyme reactions. Designing a protein that folds into a given structure is equally challenging. For a protein made of 100 amino acids, there are about 10 130  possible sequences, each of which can adopt many different conformations. The thermodynamic stability of every sequence and conformation must therefore be calculated to find the lowest-energy structure (that is, the one most likely to form). Some simplifications can be made using advanced computational methods to quickly eliminate unfavourable combinations. This has resulted in several notable accomplishments, such as the complete redesign of a protein consisting of 28 amino acids 3 , the design of an amino-acid sequence that forms a structure not found in nature 4 , and the engineering of naturally occurring proteins into biosensors for trinitrotoluene (TNT) and other small molecules 5 . With these precedents, you might think that designing catalytic proteins should be straightforward, but success has been limited. Catalytically inactive proteins have been converted into modestly catalytic ones for two different reactions, but the observed enhancements of rate 6 , 7 were only about a millionth of those produced by naturally occurring enzymes. It is also sometimes difficult to prove that designer enzymes are truly catalytic on the basis of biochemical observations, and some exciting claims have been found to be flawed. But some reports of catalysis by designed enzymes have fared rather better \u2014 especially those that are based on sound crystallographic evidence 6 , 7 , 8 . An essential step in demonstrating the success of a designer enzyme, therefore, is the determination of a high-resolution crystal structure for the protein, to verify that the designed catalytic features are present. The results of R\u00f6thlisberger  et al . 1  and Jiang  et al . 2  are remarkable in the spectacular agreement between their computationally predicted enzyme models and the experimentally determined structures ( Fig. 1 ). R\u00f6thlisberger  et al . 1  made an enzyme that catalyses the Kemp elimination reaction (see Fig. 1a on page 190 for a reaction scheme). The Kemp elimination is initiated by the removal of a hydrogen ion from a carbon\u2013hydrogen bond in the substrate; the minimum requirement for catalysis of the reaction is the presence of a base to perform this step. The authors therefore identified two amino acids \u2014 aspartic acid and histidine \u2014 that have side chains that can act as bases under physiological conditions, and used these as the starting points of their putative active sites. They decorated models of the proposed active sites with other chemical groups found in proteins, choosing those that could interact favourably with groups in the substrate. They then used state-of-the-art quantum-mechanical methods to precisely place all the groups in the models to maximize stabilization of the transition state of the substrate. The authors thus obtained a large ensemble of designs for catalytic sites in enzymes. Next, R\u00f6thlisberger  et al . selected about 100 proteins that could be used as scaffolds for their proposed active sites. The criteria for selection were the availability of high-resolution crystal structures and the presence of pre-organized cavities, with a preference for proteins that behave well in experiments (that is, those that have good solubility, are expressed easily in cells, and so on). The authors then used computational methods to search each of the proteins for specific regions that could accommodate the sites, narrowing down the vast number of possibilities to about 100,000 promising leads. These were whittled down further using an automated modelling technique to find the optimal amino-acid sequence in defined shells around the active site, selecting sequences that maintained protein stability and integrity. This computational screening method picked out 59 candidate enzymes, which the authors expressed in cells and evaluated for their ability to catalyse the target reaction. Only eight of the proteins had measurable catalytic activity. The team then used  in vitro  evolution to further optimize one of their successful leads (designated KE07), mutating the amino-acid sequence in both random and directed locations. After several rounds of mutation and screening, R\u00f6thlisberger  et al . obtained improved enzymes that were up to 200 times more active than KE07. The best two of these mutants accelerate the rate of the Kemp elimination reaction to about a million times that of the uncatalysed version. The strategy used by R\u00f6thlisberger  et al . 1  promises to be general, as the same group 2  has successfully applied the procedure to another chemical transformation known as the retro-aldol reaction, which is very different from the Kemp elimination. The complexity of the design procedure is underlined by the number of interdisciplinary groups involved in the work, and by the huge amount of computational power required to solve the problem \u2014 donated from hundreds of thousands of idling computers around the world as part of a project known as Rosetta@home 9 . Those in the know might say that the performance of the designed enzymes is far from impressive \u2014 the reaction-rate enhancements for typical, naturally occurring enzymes are anywhere between 10,000 and 1 billion times higher than those of the artificial enzymes described in these papers 1 , 2 . Furthermore, the chosen reactions are relatively easy targets. The Kemp elimination is accelerated by several catalysts, including various synthetic compounds, catalytic antibodies and even serum albumin. Similarly, the retro-aldol reaction is catalysed by antibodies 10  and by various peptides 11 , 12 . Indeed, the rate enhancements reported by R\u00f6thlisberger  et al . 1  are equivalent to those of only the most sophisticated catalytic antibodies 13 , 14 ; the enhancements obtained by Jiang  et al . 2  for the retro-aldol reaction are even more modest. Another limitation of the design process is that, although naturally occurring enzymes have evolved to optimize steps other than just catalysis (such as the binding of substrates and the release of products), the model used by the authors 1 , 2  to design their enzymes doesn't attempt to address these factors. This is understandable, because many of the finer features that provide enzymes with their unique properties are not yet understood. For example, the mutations introduced by the authors into their enzymes by directed evolution did not modify the active site itself, but occurred at neighbouring positions ( Fig. 1 ). The effect of some of these mutations can be easily understood with hindsight, but others are much less obvious. It was therefore wise of the authors to let nature lend a helping hand in their designs. Nevertheless, these results 1 , 2  are a milestone in biochemistry. For the first time, artificial enzymes have been designed for non-biological reactions, providing rate accelerations that are about 1,000 times faster than previous examples of computationally designed enzymes. Biochemists have long wanted to build artificial enzymes to identify and validate the minimal requirements for enzyme-like catalysis. These reports provide an accurate framework for this enterprise to which further features can be added. As R\u00f6thlisberger  et al . 1  note, the ability to design enzymes will truly test our understanding of enzyme catalysis. Reprints and Permissions"},

The circuit is low-power, works at room temperature \u2014 and could point to a way forward for silicon electronics. Over the past three decades, as the components that make up integrated circuits have been made smaller and smaller, the power of computer chips has grown exponentially, even as their cost has fallen drastically. But sooner rather than later \u2014 by around 2020, according to one estimate 1  \u2014 the scaling-down process will become difficult to maintain 2 , 3 . The energy required to represent a bit of information will become larger than the heat that can be carried away from a tiny circuit element; what's more, as devices approach the size of atoms, quantum-physical phenomena will become important, changing even the ground rules of how bits are processed. Writing in  Applied Physics Letters 4 , Nishiguchi  et al . detail what might be one way to circumvent, and even exploit, these issues. They describe a circuit that allows them to perform the computing operation of pattern matching by harnessing the stochastic, quantum-mechanical tunnelling of single electrons into a transistor 5 . Pattern recognition is a natural enough task for people, but is often difficult for computers. We would like our computer processors to be like us and recognize an object (a cat or a dog, say) in a photographic image, understand the meaning of spoken words, or translate efficiently from one language to another. But pattern recognition also has more abstract, fundamental uses: extracting a simple conclusion from a great body of input data, for instance. Nishiguchi  et al . 4  build on previous work 6 , 7 , 8  to construct a simple pattern-matching circuit using a basic building-block of two transistors (more precisely, metal\u2013oxide\u2013semiconductor field-effect transistors, or MOSFETs) patterned on a silicon-on-insulator wafer. They trap and store single electrons on the first of these nanoscale transistors, the 'T-FET'. They are able to reduce the rate at which electrons tunnel quantum-mechanically into a storage node on the T-FET to very low levels of around one per second. The authors show that the trapped electrons obey Poisson statistics, and represent a statistically random source of events that can be used for stochastic signal processing 9 . The job of the second transistor that makes up the authors' processor, the 'D-FET', is to detect the number of electrons stored in the T-FET. It does this through a capacitative coupling: as the number of electrons stored in the T-FET increases, the current passing through the D-FET is progressively reduced. The coupling is sensitive enough that the tunnelling of a single electron into the T-FET is registered as a discrete drop in current in the D-FET. To perform pattern matching, the individual bits of an input image must be compared with those of a reference image. Nishiguchi and colleagues set an input bit,  i , to 0 or 1 by stepping the input 'source' voltage of the T-FET. Similarly, they set a reference bit,  r , by changing the T-FET's 'gate' voltage, which controls the passage of current from the source into the storage node ( Fig. 1 ). When  i  = 0, the tunnelling rate into the T-FET is negligible. When  i  = 1, tunnelling occurs, and the number of electrons stored in the T-FET slowly builds up. The precise rate of this tunnelling is controlled by the gate voltage, and thus the reference bit: it is large when  r  = 1, and small when  r  = 0. Essentially, this set-up creates a detector that flags up when the input and reference bits are both on,  i  =  r  = 1: in this case, electrons build up in the T-FET particularly fast, and the current passing through the D-FET decreases rapidly. To recognize a pattern of bits such as that in an image \u2014 a series of 0s and 1s \u2014 a second unit is required that responds similarly when  i  =  r  = 0. This can be done simply by setting the T-FET source and gate voltages on the second unit to represent the logical inverses of whatever the input and reference bits are on the first unit. The output currents from both D-FETs are then added together. The result is the equivalent of an exclusive NOR logic gate: it flags up through a sharp drop in current whenever the input and reference bits match up (whatever the values of those bits are), but does not respond when they differ. The authors demonstrate the principle of pattern matching using the circuit by feeding it sequentially with four bits representing an image of the letter n, and comparing it with four four-bit reference sequences encoding the letters n, c, o and u ( Fig. 2a ). The total error was found in each case by summing the number of electrons collected in the two T-FETs, as deduced from the drop in summed D-FET current. When the reference coding for n was used, the current drop was by far the greatest ( Fig. 2b ). Nishiguchi and colleagues' advance is opportune for two reasons. First, it comes at a time when computing is moving away from single processors towards many processors operating in parallel. 'Cloud' computing, which uses very many parallel processors, is what allows search engines such as Google to provide rapid answers to our web enquiries, and now even many laptop computers contain chips that have two or more processors, or 'cores'. In this multi-processor environment, it is increasingly likely that we would wish to add special circuits dedicated to a single purpose, such as the fundamental task of pattern recognition. Second, we are now recognizing that entirely new chip architectures and new approaches to computation are needed to continue the rapid growth in computing power to which we have become accustomed 1 , 2 , 3 . To that end, the semiconductor industry has developed a set of goals 3  for research aimed at producing truly nanoscale switches with low power requirements that work at room temperature. Nishiguchi and colleagues' circuit is a meaningful step in this direction: it uses silicon-on-insulator circuits that are compatible with conventional silicon technology, it works at room temperature, and it can respond to the stimulus of just a single electron. In its present form, this work 4  represents just a proof of principle. But extended to a system that can handle many bits, such single-electron circuits that exploit stochastic quantum-mechanical effects to produce low-power devices could be an important part of a brave new electronic future.

Kirsty Spalding and colleagues now provide scientific evidence for why Monica has every reason to be cautious (K. L. Spalding  et al .  Nature  doi:10.1038/nature06902; 2008 ). Two factors contribute to an increase in fat mass: the number of fat cells and how much fat each of them stores (their volume). The authors studied the dynamics of fat-cell number in some 700 adults, both lean and obese, and combined their data with previous observations in children and adolescents. A clear pattern emerged: irrespective of weight, the number of fat cells seems to rise steadily from birth to the early twenties, but remains constant thereafter. Moreover, in patients observed before and up to two years after surgical treatments that facilitate weight loss by reducing stomach size, no decrease in fat-cell numbers was detected \u2014 although their volume did drop. So, are fat cells that are generated in early life doomed to remain with us till death us do part? In animal studies, this question can be addressed by labelling DNA nucleotides with radioactive isotopes such as  14 C. Differentiated fat cells do not divide, and so radioisotopes, incorporated in their DNA in the last round of division before differentiation, remain there throughout the cells' life. The time of radiolabel incorporation, which is worked out from its half-life, is therefore the 'birth date' of these cells. But the potential toxicity of radioisotopes means that such studies cannot be performed in humans. Spalding  et al . cleverly thought of the next-best option. Atmospheric levels of  14 C have remained relatively constant for centuries, with the only major increase occurring between 1955 and 1963, when nuclear bombs were being tested above ground. A chain of reactions ensures that, at any given time, the radioisotope content of human DNA matches that of the atmosphere. The authors could thus follow fat-cell dynamics in individuals born around 1955\u201363. As Spalding and colleagues' results show, fat cells have a high turnover: new cells are continually being born to replace their dead predecessors. The average age of a fat cell seems to be about 10 years in both lean and obese individuals, and the number of fat cells as a proportion of all cells remains constant in each weight group. But the total number of new fat cells was higher in obese subjects, suggesting that they are replenishing an existing larger pool. So do the lean among us need to worry about our diet if we have fewer fat cells? Yes, we do: our fewer fat cells can still store large amounts of fat. Also, can obese people do anything about their weight? After all, they've already accumulated a large pool of fat cells in childhood and adolescence? Again, the answer is yes. As Monica seems to have guessed, they can still reduce the volume, if not the number, of their fat cells. A further corollary of the paper is that researchers seeking drugs to cure obesity should consider targeting the mechanisms underlying fat-cell turnover. Reprints and Permissions"},

Stamp"}], "parsed_as_year": "2006_or_before", "body": "Uncontrollable outside influences undermine the whole enterprise of quantum computing. Nailing down the sources of this 'decoherence' in a solid-state system is a step towards solving the problem. In the quest for a quantum computer, no obstacle is more formidable than decoherence \u2014 the 'collapse' of an information-encoding quantum wavefunction when it couples to its surroundings. We pressingly need to understand what causes it, how it works and how to get rid of it. Bertaina  et al . ( page 203  of this issue) 1  have passed a milestone on that road. They report the first observation of Rabi oscillations, a signature of coherent spin dynamics, in a magnetic molecule of a kind envisaged as the basic physical carrier of a 'qubit' of quantum information in a quantum computer. Perhaps more importantly, they have also succeeded in pinpointing the sources of decoherence in their system, and so taken the first step towards eliminating them. Magnetic molecules come in all shapes and sizes, and have spins with values ranging from 1/2, the smallest that quantum theory allows, to more than 30. Their great advantage for making qubits is that all molecules of a species are the same, and have a structure governed purely by quantum mechanics. The authors focus on the vanadium V IV 15  molecule, which, at just over a nanometre in diameter, is small-to-middling in size. It has an interesting spin structure, in which 15 vanadium ions, each with a net electronic spin of 1/2, couple strongly into three groups of five. Because of the way spins add as vector quantities (direction, as well as magnitude, counts), the whole molecule can have an overall spin of 1/2 or 3/2, depending on how the individual electron spins line up. These low-energy spin states are very widely separated from the many higher-energy states. The spin-1/2 state in particular, which has two energy levels corresponding to molecular spin 'up' and molecular spin 'down', is a natural candidate for a two-state qubit. But it's here that interactions with the environment \u2014 decoherence \u2014 become a problem. Decoherence was long thought to be a relatively simple process. A popular view was to model the environment as a 'bath' of oscillators that are not localized, but extend throughout space 2 . Decoherence was the result of transitions in the bath caused by its interactions with the central quantum system of interest. The results of experiments on simple quantum-optical systems 3  and on superconductors 4  agreed with this picture. But there were also good reasons to suppose that the oscillator-bath picture should not work in describing low- temperature decoherence in most solid-state systems, in which decoherence is mostly caused by the influence of entities in the local, rather than the extended, environment 5 . These might be nuclear spins, found almost everywhere, or else one of the many defects (some charged), dislocations and spin impurities found in anything but a perfect crystal. All these objects hop or flip quantum mechanically between a few different states, so that they act as a reservoir of quantum states known as a spin bath. A spin bath often causes little dissipation of energy, but can cause quite devastating decoherence by its interactions with the central quantum system. Bertaina  et al . 1  were able to spot Rabi oscillations between the low-energy qubit states of their vanadium molecule \u2014 the first time the phenomenon had been seen in a molecular magnet, and clinching proof that a degree of coherence is present in the system. But the authors were also able to work out what was causing decoherence, as manifested in the decay of the Rabi oscillation. They found that the prime source was the 15 vanadium nuclear spins in each molecule, with a rather smaller contribution from hydrogen nuclei (protons) also present in the structure. The experimental decoherence rate differed by only a few per cent from that expected theoretically for spin-bath decoherence in this system 5 , 6 . This result indicates that the decoherence mechanism is as follows. Each time the spin state of the qubit flips from up to down, it also flips the field on the vanadium nuclear spins. But because both other internal and externally applied fields are present, this nuclear flip is not through fully 180\u00b0. The nuclear spins attempt to realign with the field, but because the field is constantly jumping, they end up precessing in a complicated way that depends on the motion of the qubit. Quantum mechanically, this means that the dynamics of the nuclear spin bath are entangled with the qubit dynamics \u2014 decoherence has occurred, even though no energy has dissipated from the qubit into the nuclear spin bath 2  ( Fig. 1 ). This is a remarkable finding, because the magnetic moments resulting from the nuclear spin are thousands of times smaller than those associated with the electronic spin of the qubit; and yet, like David overcoming Goliath, they prove the stronger party. As far as other possible sources of decoherence are concerned, Bertaina  et al . calculated the contribution of lattice vibrations (phonons) and found it to be more than a hundred times weaker than the nuclear-spin contribution.This is because the phonon frequency is much higher than that of the qubit's Rabi oscillation, so that the phonons smoothly follow the qubit dynamics, rather than destroying it. Dipolar interactions between separate vanadium molecules are potentially more dangerous than any other decoherence source, because they are effective over long ranges 7 , 8 ; but the authors were able to suppress these effects simply by spacing the vanadium molecules far apart in a solvent. What are the implications of these results for future work? Certainly, the prospects for using magnetic molecules as qubits are good. If one can get rid of nuclear spins \u2014 perhaps using systems with only zero-spin nuclei, prepared by isotopic purification \u2014 then the intrinsic decoherence time is about 100 microseconds for a two-level system with an energy separation of around 10 gigahertz. That should be enough to permit a quantum computer to work, given sufficiently weak dipolar interactions 7 . The nature of spin-bath decoherence has now been addressed experimentally in both molecular magnets 1  and rare-earth metals 9 , 10 , and Rabi oscillations have been seen in both 1 , 9 . Such systems would thus seem to have a clear edge over a rival system posited as a viable basis for a qubit \u2014 electron transitions in the semiconductor structures known as quantum dots. In quantum dots, roughly a million nuclear spins can couple to each qubit (although ingenious methods have been proposed to deal with these 11 ). Similarly, the magnetic-molecule qubits are superior to superconducting qubits, which are so large that they inevitably harbour many defects. But before we get carried away by these latest achievements, two urgent 'architectural' problems must be solved. The first is that, in a real quantum computer, one might not have the option of keeping the qubits very far apart \u2014 so a way must be found to arrange the qubits and their interactions to suppress errors arising from dipolar interactions. The second is that the small size of the qubits means that reading out the quantum state of a large number of them, as well as controlling individual qubits externally, has so far defeated our experimental guile. But there is no fundamental reason why these problems cannot be solved. With advances such as that of Bertaina and colleagues 1 , there would seem to be good grounds for optimism for the future of spin-based quantum computation. Reprints and Permissions"},

Palaeoclimatologists are scientific detectives. Using indirect clues from concentrations of stable isotopes and trace elements, and from fossils and other components of the geological record, they infer changes in climate long before they themselves were on the scene. Direct evidence of past environmental conditions is rare, which makes it all the more valuable where it does occur. In this issue 1 , 2 , members of the EPICA (European Project for Ice Coring in Antarctica) collaboration present the latest, and longest, record from perhaps the most valuable of these archives: the atmospheric gases trapped and preserved in ice cores extracted from Earth's polar regions. Polar ice cores provide us with the long view of the cycling of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and methane. Their potential is being realized by a relatively small band of international scientists who are gradually drilling further down into the ice cap and progressively analysing older ice cores. Until recently, the Vostok ice core from eastern Antarctica set the benchmark 3  \u2014 an iconic 440,000-year data set that became a central backdrop for discussions about modern climate change. That ante was upped in 2005 by a 650,000-year record 4 , 5  from EPICA's 'Dome C', another drilling site in eastern Antarctica where much older ice could be extracted. An 800,000-year reconstruction of temperature change from the core already existed 6 . Now, after years of careful work and collaboration, Dome C has yielded a complete reconstruction of the history of atmospheric carbon dioxide (L\u00fcthi  et al .,  page 379 ) 1  and methane (Loulergue  et al .,  page 383 ) 2  over the past 800,000 years. The fundamental conclusion that today's concentrations of these greenhouse gases have no past analogue in the ice-core record remains firm. The general long-term behaviour of methane and carbon dioxide, following patterns driven ultimately by slow changes in Earth's orbit, continues throughout the older sections of the records. The remarkably strong correlations of methane and carbon dioxide with temperature reconstructions also stand ( Fig. 1 , overleaf). The data further reinforce the tight link between greenhouse gases and climate, a link maintained by as-yet only partially understood feedbacks in the Earth system. Variations in methane levels are most probably caused by variations in the influence of temperature and rainfall on wetlands in the tropics and boreal (high-northern-latitude) regions. Carbon dioxide variability is almost universally viewed as an oceanic phenomenon, a consequence of the large pools of carbon sequestered there. Changes in ocean circulation, biological productivity, carbon dioxide solubility and other aspects of ocean chemistry have been implicated, but the exact mix of mechanisms is not clear. In considering these extended records 1 , 2  in detail, intriguing nuances emerge. Their most prominent feature is a sawtooth-shaped variability on 100,000-year timescales. As reported last year 6 , the amplitude of the 100,000-year temperature cycle reconstructed at Dome C seems to have changed fundamentally about 450,000 years ago ( Fig. 1 ). Warm phases (interglacials) in the later period have been warmer, whereas cold phases (glacials) seem similar throughout the record. The carbon dioxide record generally shares this pattern, with muted cycles in its older part. Methane also follows the trend, though not as strongly: relatively high methane maxima in the oldest interglacial cycle approach those of later warm periods. A curious facet of the extended carbon dioxide record is unusually low levels of the gas during the two earliest glacial\u2013interglacial cycles. L\u00fcthi  et al . speculate 1  that, taken as a whole, the carbon dioxide record is hinting at a longer-term cycle in mean levels of the gas that takes 400,000\u2013500,000 years to complete. The eccentricity of Earth's orbit \u2014 its deviation from a perfect circle \u2014 does vary with a 413,000-year period. But whether this or some other mechanism explains any variation awaits the retrieval of an even older ice core. The extended records also provide information about shorter-term, millennial-scale climate change taking place within the longer cycles. Data from ice cores in Greenland covering the past 110,000 years show that variations in methane levels were extremely closely coupled to episodes of abrupt warming and cooling in the mid-to-high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere 7 , 8 . No older records from Greenland exist at present; indeed, records extending back further than about 200,000 years are not expected to be found there owing to high accumulation rates and the flow of older ice towards the margins of the ice sheet. But assuming that the close coupling between Greenland's temperature and levels of atmospheric methane holds before 110,000 years ago, jumps in the Dome C methane record provide a Southern Hemisphere proxy for abrupt warming in the Northern Hemisphere. Loulergue  et al . 2  identify 74 such jumps in their data and, following this logic, conclude that abrupt warming and cooling in Greenland and the Northern Hemisphere has been a characteristic of the climate system over at least the past 800,000 years. Again using methane as a proxy for Greenland's temperature patterns, it can be shown that on millennial timescales carbon dioxide concentrations rose during times when Greenland was cold. At the same time, Antarctica warmed 9 . This pattern has been attributed to the effect of changes in ocean circulation on the carbon cycle and climate 10 . L\u00fcthi  et al . 1  identify examples of this kind of variability in ice as old as 750,000 to 780,000 years, another indication that these millennial patterns pervade the palaeoclimate record. These new benchmark data 1 , 2  for greenhouse-gas variability pose questions as to what a much longer record might show. One such question is whether the 400,000\u2013500,000-year cycle speculated on by L\u00fcthi  et al . 1  is a real effect. Another is whether the 100,000-year cycles in carbon dioxide and methane, now so clearly established, give way to 40,000-year cycles before about 900,000 years ago; such behaviour might be predicted by comparison with climate reconstructions from ocean sediments 11 . If that is the case, what caused the shift? Was it a reduction in mean concentrations of greenhouse gases 900,000 years ago? This commonly cited theory 12  is just one of many competing hypotheses 11 . The international community of ice-core scientists, under the auspices of the umbrella group IPICS (International Partners in Ice Core Sciences), has set itself the immediate target of establishing a continuous 1.5-million-year record to attempt to answer these questions. The search for the right sites is beginning, and is likely to take several years. The best places are undoubtedly in eastern Antarctica, most probably in remote, high regions where snowfall rates and temperatures are extremely low. Meeting the challenge of drilling those cores should open up a further window on goings-on in the greenhouse. Reprints and Permissions"},

Edward Norton Lorenz, whose pioneering studies of atmospheric dynamics led to his accidental discovery of chaos theory, died of cancer at his home in Cambridge, Massachusetts, on 16 April. A modest, unassuming and kind man, his personal qualities and intellectual insights had been a constant feature in the field of meteorology for more than 60 years; he co-authored his last paper just weeks before his death. Born on 23 May 1917 in West Hartford, Connecticut, Lorenz took bachelor's and master's degrees in mathematics at Dartmouth College, New Hampshire, and Harvard University, respectively. Service as a weather forecaster for the US Army Air Corps during the Second World War led him into meteorology, and he received a doctorate in the subject at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in 1948. He remained in MIT's Department of Meteorology for the rest of his academic career, becoming emeritus professor there in 1987. Lorenz made crucial contributions to atmospheric science, many of which are still routinely taught to students and widely used in weather forecasting. Perhaps foremost among these is his formulation in the mid-1950s of the concept of 'available potential energy', which he used to explain how potential energy and kinetic energy are interchanged in the atmosphere. His application of these ideas culminated in his influential book of 1967,  The Nature and Theory of the General Circulation of the Atmosphere . He was also instrumental in the development of numerical techniques for weather prediction. One example \u2014 again, still widely used \u2014 is his scheme for the numerical treatment of changes in atmospheric variables with height, now known as the Lorenz vertical grid. But the work for which Lorenz is undoubtedly most widely known is a now-classic paper published in the  Journal of Atmospheric Science  in 1963. Entitled 'Deterministic nonperiodic flow', it presented surprising results from a simplified computational model that simulated thermal convection in a fluid layer heated from below and cooled from the top. The calculated flow of the fluid was extremely irregular, with almost random qualities. But more importantly, it exhibited extremely sensitive dependence on initial conditions: two fluid states that were at first just slightly different diverged from each other exponentially, with their differences doubling repeatedly at a consistent rate. When Lorenz plotted variables representing temperature and flow against one another, the system eventually adopted trajectories that traced out something akin to a pair of butterfly wings \u2014 a pattern since called the Lorenz attractor. He further observed that the system trajectory moved from one wing of the butterfly to another in a seemingly erratic manner. In his book  The Essence of Chaos , Lorenz recounts how he came to discover the extreme sensitivity of his model to small changes. Wishing to repeat his simulation, he restarted it with numbers that had been printed out for the start conditions, and left it to go down the hall to fetch a cup of coffee. On his return, he found that the result was nothing like the previous one. He soon identified the reason: the numbers from the print-out were rounded off. In the course of a coffee break, that small error had propagated with exponential speed to change the result completely. This discovery was epoch-making for two reasons. The first lay in Lorenz's integration of analytical methods with computational simulations, with which he \u2014 albeit with a pre-1960 computer that was bulkier, noisier and vastly slower than the PCs of today \u2014 set an early precedent for a mode of research that has since become a norm. But much more profound ramifications stemmed from Lorenz's realization of just how general the types of motion he had uncovered were in nonlinear systems such as the atmosphere. Most immediately for Lorenz's field, this meant that long-term weather predictions were impossible, because the atmosphere's initial state can never be specified precisely enough. That was a situation that increased computing power could not change. Lorenz perfectly encapsulated this unknowability in the title of a talk that he gave to the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 1972. The question it asks has since lodged itself in the public's consciousness: \u201cDoes the flap of a butterfly's wings in Brazil set off a tornado in Texas?\u201d But the influence of chaos theory extends far beyond meteorology, and much deeper: it challenges the entire deterministic world view, as was confidently expressed, for instance, by the mathematician and philosopher Pierre-Simon Laplace, who stated at the beginning of the nineteenth century that the entire future could be determined by constructing and solving the equations governing all components of the Universe. Although the existence of chaos had been recognized before Lorenz \u2014 notably in the 1890s by Henri Poincar\u00e9, in his study of the motions of three or more gravitating celestial bodies \u2014 it was Lorenz's meteorological demonstration and analysis that established the universal applicability of the concept, and earned him the title 'the father of chaos'. But it took a decade for chaos theory to percolate through to the general scientific community. When it finally did, it launched a revolution, rapidly extending its sway into many fields of physics, chemistry, biology and engineering \u2014 and, in doing so, becoming part of the popular lexicon. Lorenz received many honours and prizes in recognition of his work, among them the Crafoord Prize \u2014 established by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences to recognize work in fields not covered by the Nobel prizes \u2014 in 1983, and the Kyoto Prize in 1991. The citation for that prize lauded \u201chis boldest scientific achievement in discovering 'deterministic chaos', a principle that has profoundly influenced a wide range of basic sciences and brought about one of the most dramatic changes in mankind's view of nature since Sir Isaac Newton\u201d.

Once considered merely protein fossils, it now emerges that some of them have active regulatory roles. A central challenge in genome annotation is determining the function of sequences that do not encode proteins, but make up the overwhelming bulk of large genomes \u2014 some 99% in humans. A significant fraction of these sequences are pseudogenes, or fossils of ancient proteins, and although many of them are transcribed into RNA, they have hitherto been deemed 'junk'. However, given the abundance of pseudogenes, it is unlikely that they are useless. One function suggested for them is gene regulation, and RNA interference (RNAi) has been proposed as the mechanism for carrying this out. Six papers 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , including three in this issue ( pages 793 ,  798  and  803 ), significantly expand the known scope of RNAi by describing the discovery of natural small interfering RNA (siRNA) sequences in mice and fruitflies, some of which are potentially transcribed from pseudogenes. The textbook definition of a pseudogene is an inheritable genetic element that is similar to a functioning gene, yet is non-functional. But what is meant by non-functional is debatable \u2014 not transcribed, not translated, or not under control of a promoter sequence? Pseudogenes are similar to protein-coding genes because they are usually copied from a parent gene, either through unsuccessful duplication or by retrotransposition (whereby a gene is transcribed into RNA, which is then 'reverse-transcribed' back into DNA and inserted somewhere different in the genome). Because all this copying does not yield a normal, functioning protein, pseudogenes are usually identified by obvious 'disablements' in their sequence, such as frameshifts or premature stops. They have been of interest because they provide records of ancient molecules encoded by the genome. Although pseudogenes have generally been considered as evolutionary 'dead-ends', one of the surprises of genome sequencing has been how abundant they are: tens of thousands of pseudogenes are found in mammalian genomes (roughly the same number as protein-coding genes in all mammals sequenced so far) 7 . In addition, a large proportion of these sequences seem to be under some form of purifying selection 8  \u2014 whereby natural selection eliminates deleterious mutations from the population \u2014 and genetic elements under selection have some use. Finally, several large-scale genomic studies probing non-gene parts of the genome for biochemical activity have found many pseudogenes being transcribed and regulatory factors binding upstream of them. One such investigation, the ENCODE pilot project 9 , which looked at a representative 1% of the sequence of the human genome, found strong evidence for at least one-fifth of pseudogenes being actively transcribed. These observations indicate that pseudogenes might not be purely dead relics of past genes but could be resurrected for new biochemical activities. Indeed, functioning pseudogenes have been reported previously. For instance, in snails, a pseudogene is involved in translational control of the gene that codes for nitric oxide synthase 10 . And transcripts of the mouse pseudogene  makorin1-p1  have been proposed to inhibit degradation of their parent gene's mRNA, effectively enhancing its expression 11 , although this observation has been debated. Nevertheless, a clear mechanism for the functioning of pseudogenes has been lacking. The six studies \u2014 four in flies 1 , 2 , 3 , 4  and two in mice 5 , 6  \u2014 provide such a direct pathway, showing that pseudogene transcripts can act as natural siRNAs. Broadly speaking, RNAi involves various types of small 'guide' RNA sequence regulating protein levels by targeting mRNA for degradation. Pseudogenic siRNAs provide two of the four categories posited by the six studies to organize the natural, or 'endo', siRNAs ( Box 1 ). Endo-siRNAs in the first category mediate transposon silencing, which is typically a feature of Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs). The studies were therefore careful to distinguish between endo-siRNAs associated with transposons and piRNAs on the basis of size (21\u201322 nucleotides versus 24\u201330) and Argonaute effector-protein partner (Ago2 versus Piwi). The second category of endo-siRNAs arise from bidirectional transcription of partially overlapping loci on opposite DNA strands 1 , 12 . Studies in mice 5 , 6  identify a few examples of these, and around 1,000 have been reported in flies 1 , with their target genes consisting mainly of those with nucleic-acid functions, such as nuclease activity and transcription-factor binding 12 . The third category of siRNAs, which have been identified only in mice 5 , 6 , are products of the interaction between a spliced mRNA transcript from a protein-coding parent gene and an antisense transcript from its pseudogene, which can be located far away from its parent gene, on the same or a different chromosome ( Fig. 1a ). Endo-siRNAs of the fourth category are closely related to those in the third. They arise from hairpin-shaped sequences, which in mice 5 , 6  can come from inverted-repeat structures of pseudogenes ( Fig. 1b ). Here, the pseudogene also regulates its parent gene, but the double-stranded RNA precursor of the endo-siRNA comes from transcription of an inverted-repeat sequence, producing a hairpin. The reports show that mouse proteins affected by the third and fourth categories of endo-siRNAs are disproportionately involved in particular functions \u2014 such as regulating cytoskeletal dynamics \u2014 which indicates that their underlying pseudogene-mediated regulation has been explicitly selected for and is not simply caused by random pairing of transcribed genes and pseudogenes. Hairpin precursors of endo-siRNAs have also been found in flies, but the evidence links them only weakly with inverted repeats of pseudogenes. Thus, most of the new data for pseudogenic siRNAs come from mouse rather than fly studies. One possible reason for this is that the mouse genome contains many more pseudogenes than the fly genome 13 . In fact, even compared with other metazoan organisms such as worms, flies are particularly poor in pseudogenes, possibly owing to pronounced genomic deletion processes known to occur in this organism 14 . The scarcity of pseudogenes in flies makes their detection particularly difficult. Nevertheless, there is suggestive evidence for fly pseudogenes functioning as endo-siRNAs. First, an appreciable number ( \u223c 30) have an inverted-repeat structure, associated with the formation of hairpins. Second, many of the sequences obtained by ultra-high-throughput sequencing of small RNAs in the fly coincide with DNA regions containing pseudogenes. In particular, a small but significant number of the 'reads' found using the Solexa sequencing technology 1 , 4  can be intersected with some 70 pseudogenes, for an average of roughly 12 reads each. Finally, there is strong evidence that for several genes \u2014 particularly the \u03b2-esterase gene and its pseudogene \u2014 a duplicated pseudogene forms a functional complex with its parent gene, with regulatory consequences 15 . Of course, to demonstrate the activity of pseudogenes conclusively, further experiments are needed. Deleting a pseudogene and demonstrating an effect on its potentially regulated parent gene would be most definitive. Also of great value would be studying the expression patterns of a potential endo-siRNA-producing pseudogene and its regulated parent gene across various tissues \u2014 data which should be generated by the ENCODE and modENCODE projects. In addition to connecting RNAi with pseudogenes, the new studies 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6  also blur the distinctions between the three 'traditional' classes of small RNA \u2014 siRNAs, piRNAs and microRNAs (miRNAs) \u2014 which are distinct in their biogenesis and cellular roles ( Box 1 ). The studies 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6  find that endo-siRNAs regulate transposons as piRNAs do; that, like miRNAs, they can arise from hairpins; and that, in flies, their processing involves a similar co-factor to the processing of miRNAs ( Box 1 ). This blurring of boundaries among different types of small RNA, together with the newly established links between siRNAs and pseudogenes, has interesting evolutionary implications. In plants, inverted duplications containing a protein-coding gene have been proposed 16  as a mechanism to create new miRNAs. Thus, one can imagine a gene being copied (either by duplication or retrotranscription) and this copy then being duplicated (again) in inverted fashion. Given the ubiquitous nature of genomic transcription, the copy and its inverted duplicate could potentially be transcribed to a hairpin precursor of endo-siRNAs to regulate the parent gene. As the function of the hairpin no longer has anything to do with encoding protein, its sequence, still under selection, can acquire frameshifts and stop codons, making it seem pseudogenic. One could even imagine its sequence drifting further and becoming gradually transformed into a miRNA gene, the sequence of which is much less similar to the gene encoding its target mRNA. So pseudogenes encoding endo-siRNAs might provide a crucial intermediate link to understanding the evolution of miRNA-mediated regulation 17 . Although speculative, the plausibility of this theory is bolstered by a recent survey 18  of the genomic context of more than 300 human miRNA loci, which identified two that lie within pseudogenes.

The story behind the improved bathymetric chart \u2014 IBCAO Version 2.0 \u2014 is told by Martin Jakobsson and colleagues in  Geophysical Research Letters  (M. Jakobsson  et al .  Geophys. Res. Lett.   35 , L07602; 2008). Its production is an instructive case of new data being married to a reinterpretation of old. Most of the new data come from mapping missions carried out since 2000 with multibeam sonar equipment aboard various vessels, including USCGC  Healy , RV  Polarstern  and IB  Oden . Multibeam sonar systems differ from the sidescan systems used, for example, to look at the shape of the sea floor or to detect wrecks, in providing information mainly about depth.  The more dramatic changes to version 2 over version 1 are that, as the authors laconically put it, the \u201cdeep abyssal plains are systematically ca. 50\u201360 m deeper ...\u201d. The revision stems from a metadata analysis of records collected by US Navy submarines over several decades, which are a central source of bathymetric information at high northern latitudes in particular. Conversion of data for version 1 was based on an assumption that the figure for the speed of sound in water used for the original calculations was 1,500 m s \u22121 . But in many cases the figure applied was 1,463 m s \u22121 . Hence the change in estimated depth, which also helps to explain several anomalies evident in version 1. The three-dimensional views shown here are depictions of the Alaskan Slope and Northwind Ridge before (upper image) and after Jakobsson and colleagues' exercise in producing version 2. The image is about 650 km across, and the black area at the upper left is Alaska; the Northwind Ridge is the 'peninsula' on the right. The improved definition is evident in the sharper depiction of the gullies, caused by erosion, that scar the Alaskan Slope. The new map is far from the final word. The authors point out that a near-perfect bathymetric model will require comprehensive multibeam coverage, which won't be available anytime soon.

Large meteorite fragments have been found in or near most craters. A possible explanation of the lack of meteorite fragments in the other cases is that the meteors concerned were of contraterrene constituency (anti-matter). In this case no traces of the meteors would remain, due to the annihilation process. One of these events, from which no fragments appear to have survived, has occurred in recent years. In 1908 a meteor, apparently of great size, was seen passing over western Russia; a few minutes later it crashed in the Siberian wastes with an explosion, effects of which were felt for hundreds of miles around, and seismographs thousands of miles away registered its impact ... No expedition to the site of its landing was undertaken until 1927, when the devastation found even at 40 miles from the site was almost inconceivable; but no fragments of the meteor were located despite the several huge though shallow craters which it had caused.

It isn't surprising, then, that plant breeders, fascinated with this ancient rose family, brought it to Europe in the nineteenth century to generate the now popular hybrid tea roses, among many others. But how did the distinctive scent of Chinese roses evolve? Gabriel Scalliet and colleagues now provide the answer (G. Scalliet  et al . Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA 105, 5927\u20135932; 2008).  Unlike their European counterparts, the main scent component of Chinese roses and their descendants is dimethoxytoluene. In the final steps of its formation, two methyl groups are sequentially added to a precursor molecule in reactions catalysed by enzymes called OOMT1 and OOMT2. These enzymes are almost identical in amino-acid sequence, yet they target different substrates. Scalliet and colleagues pinpoint the crucial amino-acid residues of the enzymes that confer substrate specificity: a tyrosine in OOMT1 and a phenylalanine in OOMT2. Swapping these single residues between the two enzymes switched their substrate specificity, most probably by changing the steric and hydrophobic properties of their substrate-binding sites, where these residues reside. Moreover, OOMT2 could methylate the target of OOMT1  in vitro , albeit with lower efficiency. Two nearly identical enzymes with nearly identical activities, that can both perform similar reactions, although together they are more efficient than alone \u2014 these are hallmarks of the products of duplicated genes, which arise when a gene doubles in number and one of the copies then undergoes a minor mutation. Indeed, Scalliet  et al . show that, although all of the 13 European rose species they examined carry an OOMT-like gene, only the Chinese species, which are evolutionarily younger, carry two types of this gene. The authors' further phylogenetic analysis strongly hints that, in Chinese species, the second OOMT gene arose through a duplication event. Roses are not unique in acquiring new functions through gene duplication; this is thought to be a fundamental mechanism for generating diversity between and within organisms. But it isn't always possible to trace such changes, which makes Scalliet and colleagues' work of interest not only to plant biologists but also to evolutionary scientists. Reprints and Permissions"},

Willis Lamb, who died on 15 May aged 94, received his highest recognition in 1955, when he was awarded one half of the Nobel Prize in Physics for his discovery of the subtle quantum-mechanical shift in energy levels of the hydrogen atom that now bears his name. But in truth, he might have been nominated twice more. He produced a theory of the resonant absorption of \u03b3-rays by solid-state atoms \u2014 the M\u00f6\u00dfbauer effect \u2014 19 years before Rudolf M\u00f6\u00dfbauer himself published the observations that won him a share of the 1961 prize. And in the early 1960s, Lamb developed one of the first, semi-classical theories of how lasers work. Lamb was born on 12 July 1913 in Los Angeles, and as an undergraduate at the University of California, Berkeley, studied chemistry. But he became increasingly fascinated with physics, and his presaging of the M\u00f6\u00dfbauer effect was part of a doctoral dissertation on the electromagnetic properties of nuclear systems, completed in 1938 under the guidance of J. Robert Oppenheimer. Unlike many of his generation of physicists, Lamb did not follow Oppenheimer into the wartime atom-bomb project. Instead, he concentrated on his specialisms \u2014 microwaves and radar \u2014 at Columbia University in New York, performing the experiments that culminated in the observation of the Lamb shift (W. E. Lamb Jr and R. C. Retherford  Phys. Rev.   72 , 241\u2013243; 1947). This shift is a tiny difference in energy between two atomic orbitals in hydrogen, denoted 2 s  and 2 p , distinguished only by their angular momenta. Quantum theories of the time predicted that these levels should have identical energies. The discovery that they did not, demanded a fundamental theoretical rethink \u2014 one that was initiated almost immediately by Hans Bethe. The Lamb shift thus became a cornerstone of the modern edifice of quantum electrodynamics (QED). This, the quantum field theory of the electromagnetic interaction, explains the shift as resulting from energy fluctuations in the vacuum that smear out the position of the electron in a hydrogen atom. This process has a greater effect on the Coulomb energy of the electron's binding to the central proton at smaller radii (where the 2 s  state is most likely) than at larger radii (where the 2 p  state dominates). Today, precise measurements of the Lamb shift have tested QED to an accuracy of better than one part in a million. Lamb's disposition made him entirely suited to the difficult measurements of this tiny shift. A perfectionist, his approach to physics embodied the principle that physical intuition is a necessary, but not sufficient, condition for success. A sound conclusion demanded a solid calculation or experiment. That perfectionism extended to Lamb's writing: he would spend considerable time revising papers, or having his students revise them, pondering long and hard over subtle refinements such as the insertion of a comma. That honed his students' ability to write and led to unusually readable papers. But his meticulousness was never overbearing, and was always tempered by a wry, self-deprecating sense of humour. He was an outstanding supervisor, inspiring many students and postdocs with sharp insight and sure guidance. I recall trying to convince him to take me on as a graduate student, presumptuously claiming expertise in his field of interest. His response was that he was always interested in expertise, as he had so little of his own. It was the start of a long and fertile collaboration on laser theory. In his later career, Lamb's refusal to generalize conclusions purely on intuition prevented him on occasion from publishing important work that didn't meet his own high standards. Perfection for him was a quality to be strived for, and perhaps not to be attained. He once told me that he regretted having been so close to so many great discoveries without realizing it. I replied that I wished I had that problem. Lamb's contributions to laser physics were a case in point. The first microwave-frequency equivalent of the laser, the maser, had been constructed by Charles Townes and collaborators at Columbia in 1953. But like others working on the extension of the maser to higher, optical frequencies, Lamb was convinced that a closed cavity, such as that in which light was amplified in a maser, would be needed to create a laser. It was left to Gordon Gould to predict that an open cavity could lase, and for Theodore Maiman to implement the idea in 1960. Lamb's part was nevertheless substantial. His theory of laser action (W. E. Lamb Jr  Phys. Rev.   134 , A1429\u2013A1450; 1964) predicted the 'Lamb dip' in the output intensity of a gas laser. This spectral feature is a consequence of the Doppler effect, occurring when, owing to thermal motions of the gas, an atomic absorption line becomes smeared out in frequency. In this case, two oppositely directed light waves will interact with atoms of the same velocity if tuned to the centre of the Doppler-broadened line, but with atoms of different velocities when tuned off-resonance. The laser gain thus saturates at a lower intensity on resonance. This Lamb dip in lasers, and its counterpart in absorptive media, enabled the creation of incredibly stable devices that redefined the way we measure time and distance. The fact that Lamb's 1964 laser theory was semi-classical was again entirely typical: Lamb was fascinated by the extent to which nature was necessarily quantum-mechanical. In particular, he insisted that the original photoelectric effect \u2014 the proof of whose quantum nature had garnered Albert Einstein his Nobel in 1921 \u2014 could be accounted for using a classical electromagnetic field. He had little patience for those who misused the term 'photon', particularly in situations where a classical electromagnetic wave would suffice, even once saying that he should be given responsibility for issuing licences for its use. Tall and handsome, at first sight Willis Lamb seemed more Hollywood actor or high-flying businessman than scientist. But his dedication to physics was complete, and did not diminish in a 65-year career that encompassed Bell Labs (as a consultant on laser theory) and Stanford, Harvard, Oxford and Yale universities. He retired from the faculty of the University of Arizona only in 2002, at the age of 89. Reprints and Permissions"},

Its significance is more than esoteric. On  page 829  of this issue, Dolev  et al . 1  report the detection of vortices in a fluid of electrons confined to two dimensions within a semiconductor structure that carry just 1/4 of the electron's charge. These 'quasiparticles' are an exciting find: according to theoretical predictions, their collective behaviour should be described by an unusual type of particle statistics known as non-abelian statistics. Above all, that could make them useful in an exotic, but highly promising, brand of quantum computer \u2014 the topological quantum computer (see News Feature on  page 803 ) 2 . It is an established fact that, if a large magnetic field is applied perpendicular to the plane confining a soup of mobile electrons in a gallium arsenide semiconductor structure, the confined electrons can be made to enter correlated states with very unusual properties. When an electric field is applied in the plane, and at certain values of the 'filling fraction'  \u03bd  (defined as the ratio of the number of electrons in the fluid to the number of magnetic field quanta penetrating through the sample), the electrons will flow without encountering any resistance. In such states, the conductivity transverse to the electric field, the Hall conductivity, takes on the universal value  \u03bde 2 /h , where  e  is the electron charge,  h  is Planck's constant and  \u03bd  = 1/ m ;  m  is an odd integer. This 'fractional quantum Hall effect' was discovered 3  in 1982, and explained theoretically 4  a year later \u2014 achievements that were rewarded with a Nobel prize in 1998. In the theoretical treatment, a quantum Hall state at filling fraction 1/ m  will involve quasiparticles of fractional electric charge  e / m . Such quasiparticles were first detected in 1997 through measurements of the statistical fluctuations of electrical current ('shot noise') on a single point contact in a quantum Hall device 5 , 6 . As well as having a charge somewhere between 0 and 1, these quasiparticles obey an intermediate form of quantum statistics that lies somewhere between the two established forms, Fermi\u2013Dirac statistics and Bose\u2013Einstein statistics. Fermi\u2013Dirac statistics applies to systems of spin-1/2 'fermions', which obey the Pauli exclusion principle; particles covered include electrons, protons, neutrons, quarks, neutrinos and atoms with an odd number of constituent particles. Bose\u2013Einstein statistics governs the behaviour of collections of integer-spin 'bosons': atoms with an even number of constituents such as photons, gluons and the yet-to-be-found Higgs particle. A crucial difference between fermions and bosons is that a wavefunction describing two bosons is symmetrical when the two particles are swapped around in space: it does not change sign, and the wavefunctions before and after the particle exchange are said to have a phase factor of 0. The wavefunction describing two fermions, on the other hand, is antisymmetrical, flipping sign when particles are exchanged (phase factor  \u03c0 ). But the phase of the wavefunction representing two quasiparticles in a two-dimensional system such as a quantum Hall fluid can change by an arbitrary phase factor, not just 0 or  \u03c0 . The precise value of this phase depends on both the nature of the two quasiparticles and how their paths through space-time intertwine or 'braid' \u2014 a latitude that led to these quasiparticles being dubbed 'anyons' (see also 'Braiding anyons' 2  on page 804). Anyons in a fractional quantum Hall fluid with filling factor 1/ m  are predicted to have fractional statistical phase  \u03c0 / m . And indeed, the fractional quantum Hall states observed so far do largely follow that prediction. But remember that  m  is supposed to be an odd number; thus, the discovery some 20 years ago 7  of a no-resistance quantum Hall state with an even denominator, at a filling factor of 5/2, was initially puzzling. This state was soon realized to have very special properties 8 , 9 : the associated quasiparticles would also have fractional charge, but would obey non-abelian statistics. The definition of non-abelian statistics is complex, but one facet is that the state of a system of many quasiparticles obeying non-abelian statistics cannot be completely determined by knowing the quasiparticles' spatial coordinates. Several linearly independent wavefunctions are possible: a system with four quasiparticles, for instance, can have two different states. In this situation, the final state of an exchange interaction is a linear combination of the two initial states, and the braiding process as particles interact and their trajectories intertwine is encoded in a two-by-two matrix. More generally, for a system with 2 n  quasiparticles, there are 2 n \u22121  states. In general, because any pair of quasiparticles in the quantum fluid can become intertwined, these states do not commute with each other \u2014 in other words, the order in which the exchange interactions between quasiparticles occur will determine the system's final state. This order-dependence of the state is crucial to the proposed use of non-abelian quasiparticles as the basic 'qubits' of information in a topological quantum computer 2 , 10 , 11 . Dolev and colleagues' detection 1  of a quasiparticle of charge  e /4 is a first step in that direction. The discovery was made in a shot-noise experiment similar to those in which the original quasiparticle states were found 5 , 6 . But the new measurement was much harder to make than those pioneering experiments: the 5/2 state is so delicate that to study it requires a sample quality such that the mean free path of electrons before they collide with impurities in the semiconductor structure is very long (about 0.5 millimetres). It also requires low temperatures so that thermal fluctuations do not obscure the state. Naively, one would have expected that the quasiparticle in the 5/2 state, with its denominator of 2, would have a charge of  e /2 (the multiplier of 5 in the numerator is not relevant to these considerations). But through a series of non-trivial consistency checks, Dolev  et al . show that the charge at filling fraction 5/2 is consistent with  e /4, but not with  e /2 (at integer filling fraction, the measured charge is just  e  and at a filling fraction 1/3 it is  e /3). For that reason, this quasiparticle is also called a 'half-vortex' state. Measuring the charge to be  e /4 is a necessary, but not sufficient proof of a non-abelian state: there is a conceivable (but very unlikely) possible 'strongly paired' abelian state with the same filling fraction and charge. But an independent (and as-yet unpublished) 12  direct-current transport measurement at a point contact has not only measured the same value of the fractional charge, but also a tunnelling probability consistent with the predictions for a non-abelian state. Further tests of the statistics of these intriguing quasiparticles at single point contacts will be the next step. They will be the key to the development of well-controlled, multi-contact quantum inteferometers that are needed to test the properties of these intriguing quasiparticles, and thus to construct the qubits of a topological computer.

It emerges that these receptors not only detect odour molecules but, unexpectedly, can also act as ion channels. All creatures sample their environment for chemicals that indicate the presence of food, mates, predators, dangers and attractions through mechanisms that were thought to be evolutionarily conserved from nematode worms to mammals. For example, in many organisms, odorant molecules bind to their receptors on the surface of neurons, initiating an intracellular signalling cascade. This ultimately results in the opening of ion channels conveying current, thereby completing the transformation of these chemical signals into electrical signals. It was thus assumed that the olfactory system of flies would function similarly. But when the fly odour receptor proteins were finally identified 1 , 2 , 3 , a new riddle surfaced: what are the intermediary molecules that couple these receptors to the activation of ion channels in insect sensory neurons? Reporting in this issue, Sato  et al . 4  and Wicher  et al . 5  provide an answer to this question, but in doing so raise others that are just as puzzling. To detect odours, vertebrates and worms use members of a large family of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), which thread through the cell membrane seven times. The initial identification of odorant receptors (ORs) in insects relied on the assumption that these organisms also detect odours through GPCRs. In 1999, three laboratories identified 1 , 2 , 3  a family of these 'seven-transmembrane' receptors whose expression in the antennae of the fruitfly  Drosophila melanogaster  turned out 6  to control the responses of individual olfactory neurons to chemical odorants. But the first hint that insects detect odours differently from mammals came from analysis of the receptors' amino-acid sequences 1 , 2 , 3 . Although the vertebrate receptors are similar in sequence to other known GPCRs, the fly receptors are not. Moreover, unlike mammals, in which only one gene encoding a receptor is believed to be expressed in a given neuron, in fly sensory neurons at least one member of the receptor family Or83b is co-expressed with the insect odorant receptors. (Or83b is an essential co-receptor that does not bind to any known ligand, but is necessary for the intracellular transport and proper function of its companion receptor 7 .) Finally, and perhaps most peculiarly, the insect receptors seem to lie in the membrane in the opposite configuration to GPCRs \u2014 that is, their amino terminus faces the cytoplasm and their carboxy terminus faces the outside 8 . The observations of Sato  et al . 4  ( page 1002 ) and Wicher  et al . 5  ( page 1007 ) may set things straight, albeit in an unexpected way. Both teams independently find that odour stimulation of multi-unit OR/Or83b complexes in cells grown in culture leads to inward cationic currents. Moreover, they show that the ionic conductance and permeability of the channels carrying these currents are similar to those of other known voltage-independent, non-selective channels for positive ions. Together, the authors' observations provide compelling evidence that, for odour detection, insects use an unusual strategy and an unusual receptor \u2014 the 'receptor' is in fact an ion channel. However, the two groups 4 , 5  have remarkably different mechanistic views of the sequence of events that occur from ligand binding to channel opening. Through various experiments, Sato  et al . rule out any role for G proteins. Instead, they conclude that the OR/Or83b complexes include an ion-channel function that is directly activated by odorant ligands. By contrast, Wicher and colleagues' data implicate a signalling molecule \u2014 the cyclic nucleotide cAMP \u2014 that is produced in response to G-protein-mediated signalling, which then activates the receptor/channel. These authors find that cAMP is generated in response to odours, and that modulators of G-protein signalling can affect OR/Or83b function. Most surprisingly, they also show that Or83b alone can form a cyclic-nucleotide-sensitive channel. How can these contradictory findings be reconciled? One explanation might lie in the timescale of events that the two groups investigated. Sato  et al . concerned themselves with the initial response that occurs within the first second or so after odour application, whereas Wicher  et al . focused mainly on the cAMP-dependent responses that peak at between 30 and 60 seconds. So it could be that the opening of OR/Or83b complexes is regulated by both ligands and cyclic nucleotides, but on different timescales: odorants mediate fast detection by opening the channels, whereas cyclic nucleotides provide longer-lasting modulation. Although further work is needed to tease all this apart, the two studies add yet another unexpected twist to our knowledge of the seven-transmembrane receptor family: along with another GPCR channel, channelrhodopsin, and the structurally similar halorhodopsin ion pump 9 , 10 , there is now an odour-activated channel receptor. The coincidental arrival of these two papers and the subsequent review process raises an interesting set of editorial issues. We acted as a referee, and were somewhat involved in the process. Separately, each paper presents a convincing argument for a novel receptor-channel protein; taken together, they contain contradictory data that are difficult to reconcile. Of course, this is not the first time papers with contradictory views have been published. In the 1980s a controversy raged over the identity of the intermediate signalling molecule in photoreception \u2014 calcium or cGMP. No fewer than five papers appeared in  Nature  alone describing results that supported one or the other candidate, until a pivotal experiment 11  resolved the issue in favour of cGMP. Although journals, editors and reviewers have a responsibility to vet papers for accuracy and correctness, we must also recognize that, at its frontiers, science doesn't always produce unequivocal data. It is no less a responsibility to ensure that the literature accurately reflects what is known at the time. As George Bernard Shaw (paraphrasing Immanuel Kant) said in a toast to Albert Einstein:\u201cScience is always wrong. It never solves a problem without creating ten more.\u201d Would we have it otherwise? Reprints and Permissions"},

Yoji Totsuka, a major figure in the world of particle physics, died on 10 July after a long battle with cancer. He was a leading light in the thrilling advances in the physics of neutrinos over the past 30 years, and was a notably resolute figure in seeing through the rebuilding of the Super-Kamiokande neutrino detector after a disastrous accident in 2001. Born on 6 March 1942, in Fuji, Japan, Totsuka received his bachelor's, master's and PhD degrees from the University of Tokyo. His thesis project studied ultra-high-energy particle interactions, so kick-starting his lifelong passion for particle physics. As a research associate with the University of Tokyo, he then travelled to the Deutsches Electron Synchrotron Laboratory in Germany to investigate electron\u2013positron collisions. He went on to accept an associate professorship at Tokyo in 1979. Perhaps the turning point in Totsuka's career came in 1981, when he started work on the Kamiokande experiment with Masatoshi Koshiba \u2014 who was later jointly awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics with Ray Davis Jr for the detection of cosmic neutrinos. The Kamiokande project was originally designed to detect proton decays. A tank of ultra-pure water acted as a source of protons; the products of proton decay would interact with the water to produce distinctive Cherenkov radiation, which could be observed by hundreds of photomultiplier tubes arranged around the inner surface of the tank. A huge volume of water was required (3,000 tons), which was buried deep underground to block out background noise from cosmic rays. The experiment set stringent limits on the proton-decay process and was also able to study both low-energy neutrinos from the Sun and neutrinos produced in Earth's atmosphere by cosmic rays. Solar neutrinos had previously been detected by Ray Davis Jr in the late 1960s with the use of a chlorine-based detector, but only one-third of the expected neutrino flux was observed. This discrepancy with theory became known as the solar neutrino deficit and was an early indication of a problem in understanding neutrinos. In 1987, the Kamiokande collaboration had a stroke of luck when a supernova exploded in the Large Magellanic Cloud. Along with the Irvine\u2013Michigan\u2013Brookhaven consortium in the United States, the Kamiokande detector observed the resulting burst of neutrinos. This event was hailed as the birth of neutrino astronomy. More than 800 scientific papers were subsequently written that used the data to extract information about the properties of the supernova and of the neutrinos themselves. Shortly after the supernova, Koshiba retired and Totsuka became leader of the Kamiokande project. Two seminal results from the group were subsequently published. The first observed a deficit in atmospheric neutrinos that could not be explained by systematic experimental errors or uncertainties in the background neutrino flux. Instead, some \u201cas-yet-unaccounted-for physics\u201d, as the paper put it, might explain the data. The second crucially confirmed the solar neutrino deficit recorded by Davis. In 1991, Totsuka obtained funding for a successor to Kamiokande. This was Super-Kamiokande, an underground detector that contained 50,000 tons of water. Super-Kamiokande provided the first definitive evidence for neutrino oscillations and neutrino mass. Neutrino oscillation is a process in which neutrinos convert between one of three types: electron neutrinos, muon neutrinos and tau neutrinos. Atmospheric neutrinos are predominantly muon and electron neutrinos. Because these particles can pass through the Earth without being absorbed, it was predicted that as many atmospheric neutrinos should come up from the ground as travel down from the sky. But the observations with Super-Kamiokande found that, although there were equal numbers of electron neutrinos travelling in these directions, fewer muon neutrinos were detected coming up than were going down. We now know that, because the upward-going muon neutrinos had travelled much farther \u2014 through the planet \u2014 than those that came directly down through the atmosphere, they had more time to convert into tau neutrinos (which were essentially invisible to the detector). This evidence of neutrino oscillation suggested an explanation for the solar neutrino deficit: the 'missing' electron neutrinos from the Sun might simply have been converted into tau neutrinos and muon neutrinos, which could not be spotted by the earlier detectors. This was later confirmed through work at Super-Kamiokande and at the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory in Canada. In 2003, Totsuka became the Director General of Japan's high-energy physics organization, KEK. Over the next three years, he oversaw the K2K neutrino-oscillation experiment, in which a beam of neutrinos was sent 250 km from the KEK accelerator to Super-Kamiokande. This experiment confirmed the earlier findings of atmospheric neutrino oscillation. During this period, Totsuka also supervised the successful Belle B-factory, where particles known as B-mesons were generated to study differences between matter and antimatter. Totsuka proved his mettle as a leader in the aftermath of the Super-Kamiokande accident in 2001, when thousands of photomultipliers in the detector imploded. The day after the accident, he announced that the detector would be reconstructed within a year. In just two months he established a road-map to achieve this, and the detector was indeed ready for action 13 months after the accident. During the last year or so of his illness, Totsuka wrote a blog in which he aired his views on science and science policy. He also used this forum to describe his own illness, plotting the extent of his cancer as a function of time, and evaluating the effectiveness of the chemical treatment. And, revealing entirely different interests, he discussed the flowers in his garden and in the village where Super-Kamiokande is located. Totsuka received international recognition for his work, winning many academic prizes \u2014 perhaps most notably the Order of Culture, the most prestigious prize in Japan. It is a testament to his achievements that neutrino physics continues to generate enormous interest. The efforts of the Super-Kamiokande collaboration laid the foundations for the current, detailed understanding of the atmospheric neutrino anomaly and the solar neutrino problem. Yoji Totsuka was central to those efforts, and his vision and leadership will be sorely missed. Reprints and Permissions"},

Steck"}], "parsed_as_year": "2006_or_before", "body": "In a disordered medium, a quantum particle can literally stop itself in its tracks. This localization phenomenon can be observed directly using the coldest known form of matter, caught in a laser trap. Those familiar with the game of pachinko \u2014 in which, in its simplest incarnation, little balls bounce and cascade chaotically through a regular lattice of pin-like obstacles \u2014 have some idea of what a current of electrons goes through when it flows through the ordered crystal lattice of a metallic wire. But now imagine that you are playing quantum pachinko. Instead of little balls, wavelets shoot around the atomic obstacle course. The rules of the game are suddenly very difficult: if the waves have the right energy, they complete the course with aplomb, moving around the lattice essentially unimpeded. But you only need to change things slightly, by putting the obstacles in a marginally more disordered arrangement, to stop those quantum waves in their tracks. This phenomenon is known as Anderson localization, and influences many physical properties of disordered and amorphous materials 1 . Two papers in this issue 2 , 3  do their bit for a better understanding of it. They detail how the first direct images of this process of 'localization through disorder' were obtained. But let's return first to our electrons in a wire. An electron in a conducting material is stuck in one of a series of potential wells, each representing an atom in the crystal lattice of the conductor. Quantum mechanics says that in each well, the electron can only occupy certain energy levels. The positioning of these levels depends on the depth and width of the well. Suppose, for simplicity, that there is only a single possible level in each well ( Fig. 1a ). In a perfect crystal, with a perfectly regular lattice of identical wells, the levels in each well will then line up exactly, and an electron can thus easily tunnel between the wells. The result: electrons are freely mobile, and the material conducts. Consider now what happens when the lattice is disordered. This might be because of chemical impurities, defects or an innately amorphous structure. The energy levels no longer line up nicely in neighbouring wells, and the electron is blocked from burrowing through the well wall when it finds an energy mismatch that is too large ( Fig. 1b ). When a determined electron encounters such an obstacle, it can try to change path, and tunnel into a different well. But at some point, it is always frustrated, coming across a barrier that it cannot surmount. Returning to a quantum-wave picture, this acts as an interference effect: an electron tries to take different paths of effectively random lengths, and so on average it destructively interferes with itself, no matter where in the crystal it tries to go. This was the phenomenon that Philip Anderson originally predicted 4  in 1958. A perhaps more familiar manifestation of Anderson localization comes when one shines light through a stack of glass slides of ever so slightly varying thickness \u2014 the transmission of light decreases exponentially as the slides are piled on 5 . For matter waves such as electrons, a direct observation of Anderson localization has been more elusive: the delicate quantum interferences required are destroyed by influences such as the vibrations in a crystal lattice; and it's difficult to image an electron in a crystal directly anyway. In the new experiments 2 , 3 , ultracold atoms replace the electrons, and the crystal lattice is an optical lattice \u2014 one supplied by the forces due to laser light. This set-up allows the localization of the atoms to be seen directly, by illuminating the atoms with laser light and taking their picture. Both groups studied the localization of atoms in a Bose\u2013Einstein condensate, a vapour of atoms so cold (at a temperature of a few nanokelvin above absolute zero) that the atoms move in perfect lock-step. Such a condensate has two agreeable properties: it has a small extent in space, so it is obvious whether or not the atoms are stuck in place; and it has a small spread in momentum, so the wavelengths of the atoms are large enough to get an overview of the surrounding landscape and so 'sense' its disorder. Bose\u2013Einstein condensates in disordered potentials had already been studied, but two experimental challenges have impeded localization being observed. First, at the densities required to produce the condensate, collisions between atoms smooth out any disorder. Second, disorder has to be produced on length scales smaller than the typical atomic wavelengths. Both groups solved the first problem by allowing the condensate to expand, thus lowering its density, before looking for localization; but they took different approaches to the second problem. Billy  et al . ( page 891 ) 2  studied atoms moving in a fine-grained 'laser speckle field', such as is produced when a laser beam is scattered by a finely roughened surface. By contrast, Roati  et al . ( page 895 ) 3  used a superposition of optical lattices made from lasers of unequal wavelengths. This creates a 'quasicrystal' that is a halfway house between a perfectly regular crystal and an entirely amorphous one \u2014 with an intermediate degree of disorder that is still sufficient for localization. Both groups observed the freezing of atomic motion as they introduced disorder in their respective, carefully controlled ways. They also both observed the incontrovertible signature for Anderson localization \u2014 that the probability of finding an atom at a particular point in space diminishes exponentially the farther one moves from the original centre of the condensate. But the two experiments also had interesting twists of their own. Billy  et al . observed, for example, that a fraction of higher-energy atoms partially ignored the disorder and moved around unimpeded. Roati  et al . also observed a smoother momentum distribution in the localized state \u2014 the signature of localization in momentum space \u2014 as well as interference patterns due to atoms localized near several sites. These impressive experiments are the latest in an exciting new thrust of research: the use of ultracold atoms to study condensed-matter phenomena in precise and controlled experiments 6 , 8 , and thus bridge the gap between theory and experiment in condensed-matter physics (for an overview of current efforts in this direction, see the Q&A feature 9  in last week's issue). And on a more applied note, effects such as Anderson localization are gaining technological importance as a way to confine and control optical waves in, for example, engineered optical media 10 .

Neil Bartlett, who died on 5 August at the age of 75 from an aortic aneurysm, was one of the foremost chemists of the twentieth century. His discovery in the early 1960s of xenon fluorides, the first examples of a noble-gas compound, was a sensation. With one stroke of genius, he destroyed the long-standing dogma that the 'noble gases' (also previously known as the inert or rare gases) are unreactive. Bartlett was born in 1932, in Newcastle upon Tyne, UK, and studied for both his undergraduate and postgraduate degrees at the University of Durham. Following a brief spell as a chemistry teacher, in 1958 he emigrated to Canada and took up a position as a lecturer at the University of British Columbia (UBC) in Vancouver. In 1964, he became a full professor at UBC, but in 1966 moved to a professorship at Princeton University and also joined the research staff at Bell Telephone Laboratories in Murray Hill, New Jersey. In 1969, he accepted a professorship at the University of California, Berkeley, and became a faculty senior scientist at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, positions he held until his retirements in 1993 and 1999, respectively. Attempts to prepare compounds of the noble gases date back to the discovery of argon by William Ramsay in 1894. Among the ensuing notable events was Walther Kossel's 1916 prediction, on the basis of ionization potentials, that krypton and xenon fluorides should exist. However, attempts to verify that prediction \u2014 by Andreas von Antropoff and then by Otto Ruff and Walter Menzel \u2014 were unsuccessful. Ruff was one of the greatest inorganic fluorine chemists of all time, and had the required experience and experimental skills for the task at hand. Unfortunately, he pursued only argon and krypton fluorides, and not those of xenon. In 1933, Linus Pauling published a paper predicting the existence of H 4 XeO 6 , and of KrF 6  and XeF 6 . Using electric discharges of xenon\u2013fluorine mixtures, his colleagues Don Yost and Albert Kaye came close to making xenon fluorides. But they did not succeed in isolating measurable amounts. That failure was taken generally as evidence that the noble gases are indeed unreactive, a principle that found its way into essentially all textbooks. Bartlett, however, was undeterred. In 1962, at UBC, he carried out his famous experiment demonstrating that noble gases are not chemically inert. While pursuing the synthesis of platinum difluoride, PtF 2 , by reduction of PtF 4 , he purified PtF 4  by heating it in a stream of diluted fluorine in a Pyrex apparatus. He obtained a red sublimate, which he initially thought was platinum fluoride oxide, PtF 4 O, but subsequently identified correctly as the ionic salt dioxygen hexafluoroplatinate, O 2 + PtF 6 \u2212  \u2014 an oxidation reaction had occurred. Although the discovery of this compound was accidental, as Bartlett himself stated in Volume 9 of the  World Scientific Series in 20th Century Chemistry , his subsequent reasoning and experiments were brilliant. He recognized that if PtF 6  can oxidize dioxygen, it should also be capable of oxidizing xenon. His classic experiment in preparing xenon hexafluoroplatinate, Xe + PtF 6 \u2212 , confirmed his reasoning, and gave rise to a worldwide interest in noble-gas chemistry. Since then, thousands of papers have been published on this subject, showing that xenon can form bonds not only to fluorine but also to many other elements of the periodic table. Moreover, noble-gas chemistry is not limited to xenon \u2014 even argon can form compounds, such as HArF. Although some of them are unstable, they nevertheless exist. Bartlett's discovery of the first noble-gas compound was hailed by  Chemical & Engineering News  as \u201cone of the 10 most beautiful experiments in the history of chemistry\u201d, and \u201cone of the most important developments in inorganic chemistry in modern times\u201d. It was not, however, a one-off stroke of luck. Throughout his career, Bartlett continually demonstrated this same keen sense of reasoning and mastery as an experimentalist. He made many subsequent contributions to the field that he created, particularly in the area of xenon fluoride cations and molecular adducts of xenon fluorides with other molecules. In all of his publications, the emphasis was on quality and not quantity. Later on, he worked on problems such as the creation of synthetic metals from graphite and graphite-like boron nitride and salts of perfluoro-aromatic cations. Another major success was his synthesis and characterization of thermodynamically unstable compounds at the limits of oxidation, such as NiF 4  and AgF 3 . These compounds are powerful oxidizers and are ideal sources for the generation of high concentrations of fluorine radicals under very mild conditions. Bartlett's achievements were recognized with 25 international and national awards, fellowships in 12 different academies and societies, and honorary degrees from 9 universities. But perhaps because of his modesty and lack of interest in lobbying for honours, he did not receive the Nobel Prize in Chemistry \u2014 which, in my opinion and those of many of his peers, was clearly deserved. This sentiment is reflected by Istv\u00e1n Hargittai in the chapter \u201cWho did not win\u201d of his book  The Road to Stockholm : \n               Significantly, many chemists today assume that Bartlett has won a Nobel Prize, and in this connection the most spectacular misconception can be found in Primo Levi's book, 'The Periodic Table'. On the first page of the first chapter, he mentions Bartlett's discovery: 'As late as 1962 a diligent chemist after long and ingenious efforts succeeded in forcing the Alien (xenon) to combine fleetingly with extremely avid and lively fluorine, and the feat seemed so extraordinary that he was given a Nobel prize.' \n             The lack of the ultimate scientific recognition, the Nobel prize, in no way diminishes the impact Bartlett has had on chemistry, both directly and through his influence on students and at scientific meetings. He was an outstanding lecturer, and at meetings invariably impressed participants with his ingenious ability to analyse problems and come up with elegant solutions. But perhaps his most memorable traits were his humbleness, friendliness, loyalty and concern for others: Neil Bartlett was not only a brilliant scholar but also a true gentleman.

Optical antennas are devices designed to efficiently convert optical radiation into localized energy, and vice versa. They enhance the interaction between light and matter, and hence have the potential to boost the efficiency of optoelectronic devices ranging from light-emitting diodes to solar cells. Writing in  Physical Review Letters , Ghenuche  et al . 1  demonstrate that the resonances of gold antennas can be mapped out spectrally and spatially with a technique known as two-photon excited luminescence (TPL) spectroscopy. The experimental mapping of optical antenna resonances by TPL not only validates theoretical models but also provides an efficient means for visualizing energetically 'hot' regions in arbitrary antenna configurations. TPL in gold is a weak process that can be enhanced if coupled to surface plasmons 2 , the size and frequency-dependent resonances of a gas of electrons. Regions of high TPL intensity are associated with strong electric fields. Therefore, a spatial map of the intensity describes an antenna's characteristic electric-field distribution. Although TPL has been used before to characterize different forms of optical antennas 3 , 4 , 5 , Ghenuche  et al . 1  provide the first spectrally resolved images; that is, they record spatial maps of the TPL intensity for different excitation wavelengths. The resulting data describe the spatial\u2013spectral evolution of characteristic antenna resonances. In their experiments, the authors focused a pulsed laser beam on optical antennas fabricated by electron-beam lithography and detected the TPL emission of the antennas' response. Spatial maps of the TPL intensity were recorded pixel-by-pixel by raster scanning the antennas through the laser focus. The optical antennas they studied are gap antennas that consist of gold nanowires separated by a narrow gap of a few nanometres. The resonance wavelength of a single gold nano-rod scales linearly with the antenna length 6 . But the resonance wavelength of a gap antenna also depends sensitively on the gap size 7 . The gap antennas of Ghenuche  et al . exhibited a sharp resonance at an excitation wavelength, \u03bb, of 730 nanometres, in excellent agreement with the authors' model calculations. This agreement allowed them to identify their measured antenna resonances as higher-order modes, namely as 3\u03bb/2 and 5\u03bb/2 resonances. Antennas operating at the fundamental resonance (\u03bb/2) can be expected to be more efficient than those fabricated by Ghenuche  et al ., but they need to be shorter, requiring more stringent fabrication tolerances 3 . Also, an optical antenna interacts with the radiation it generates and it would be interesting to measure the influence of the antenna length on the TPL emission spectrum. The spatial resolution of spectroscopic TPL imaging is limited by diffraction to about a third of the wavelength of the illuminating laser. But although this resolution can identify the modes of an antenna, higher resolution is needed to fully resolve the details of the energy distribution along the antenna. One possible method for increasing resolution is to use a sharp tip or particle to locally scatter the TPL signal generated by an antenna 5 . The tip is raster scanned over the laser-irradiated antenna in close proximity, and the TPL intensity is measured as a function of the tip's scan coordinates. The resolution of this approach is only limited by the sharpness of the scatterer, and can be as high as 10 nanometres. However, strong interaction between the local scatterer and the antenna must be avoided, so that the antenna's behaviour is not perturbed. The energy distribution along an optical antenna depends both on the wavelength and on the spatio-temporal properties of the exciting light. For example, the antenna's response depends on whether the excitation laser beam irradiates the entire antenna or only a fraction of it, as is the case in this new study 1 . Similarly, the antenna's response depends on the phase profile of the laser beam and on its polarization state. The use of polarization- and phase-engineered laser pulses will allow a dynamic control of the energy distribution along an optical antenna 8 . For practical applications, antennas need to be coupled to a source of radiation (transmitter) or a sink of radiation (receiver), such as an ion, molecule or quantum dot. Efficient coupling influences the overall behaviour of the antenna, so the antenna and the receiver/transmitter need to be considered as a single system. For example, a gold gap antenna coupled to an impedance-matched source at its gap becomes a half-wave antenna 6 , 9  \u2014 that is, an antenna that no longer feels the gap. Likewise, the presence of an antenna modifies the properties of the receiver/transmitter. For instance, for an atomic or molecular system, the antenna modifies the transition rates between the different energy states 10  and, in the case of a strong interaction, it even affects the energy-level structure. Furthermore, the highly localized fields near the antenna open up new interaction mechanisms between light and matter, such as higher-order multipole transitions or momentum-forbidden transitions. These interactions, which are inaccessible in the free space, have the potential to enrich optical spectroscopy and provide new strategies for optical sensing and detection. The theoretical study of optical antennas is still in its infancy, and we can expect exciting results and developments in the near future. Optical antennas will boost the efficiency of light\u2013matter interactions and enable control of photophysical processes on the nanometre scale. This has many foreseeable applications ( Fig. 1 ), such as high-resolution microscopy and spectroscopy, photovoltaics and photocatalysis, and solid-state lighting. Reprints and Permissions"},

They have used it to create an impressively simple microfluidics device that can be produced without a clean room or photolithographic equipment. According to Bruzewicz and colleagues, second-hand desktop plotters can be had for as little as $50. Other simple components of their device are paper and the commonly used organic polymer poly(dimethylsiloxane), or PDMS, which is cheap, can be diluted in hexane solvent and is flexible when cured. The team's study is described in  Analytical Chemistry  (D. A. Bruzewicz  et al .  Anal. Chem.  10.1021/ac702605a; 2008). The system works like this. By replica moulding, the pens of the plotter are replaced with PDMS versions that can deliver various types of 'ink'. The purpose of the ink, when cured, is to create channels in a filter-paper substrate, and after experimenting with the possibilities Bruzewicz  et al . found that a syrupy mixture of 3:1 PDMS:hexane did just fine. Having chosen the appropriate paper, the trick then is to use the plotter to draw channel shapes, with the PDMS syrup penetrating the full depth of the paper to create water-tight chambers in various patterns. One form the device takes is what the authors call a \u201cdip star\u201d. Filter paper is patterned with eight PDMS channels radiating out from the centre; in principle, each of these channels can be loaded with a different chemical indicator. The flexibility of the channels means that the paper can be folded, with the centre becoming one corner that can be dipped into the fluid to be assayed. The channels are at least 1 millimetre wide. In keeping with the guiding principle of the system, the readout equipment is similarly widely available: the human eye. The authors have tested different types of the device with well-tried colorimetric assays for identifying excess protein and glucose in urine, and found they performed well, with no cross-contamination between channels. Another pattern, shown here, is a variant on the dip star. It shows that channels can be printed over a large area of paper, and can be designed for loading by multipipette rather than dipping.

Lucky prophets become vindicated sages in their own lifetimes. Arthur C. Clarke, who died on 19 March, was the luckiest of men, becoming the most famous of science-fiction writers by writing of wonder when many were writing of despair. Clarke was not unique in his optimism. He stood in a tradition of English futurists who have used fiction, non-fiction or both to paint their visions: H. G. Wells, J. D. Bernal, Olaf Stapledon, Freeman Dyson. They held that only science makes reliable prediction possible and the prospects for human society intelligible. Clarke believed that general laws for scientific extrapolation exist in a way that they do not in politics or economics. One such law was that \u201cwhen a distinguished but elderly scientist states that something is possible, he is almost certainly right. When he states that something is impossible, he is very probably wrong.\u201d Clarke, the eldest of four children, was born on 16 December 1917 to farming parents in Minehead in the south-west English county of Somerset. Following service as a radar instructor and technician with the Royal Air Force in the Second World War, he honed his scientific acumen working as an editor for the academic journal  Physics Abstracts , while earning a first-class degree in mathematics and physics at King's College London. Humanity's leap into space confirmed Clarke's role as a seer of the possible. In the immediate postwar years, he was twice chairman of the British Interplanetary Society, one of the earliest organizations dedicated to promoting space exploration. Clarke stayed true to the society's motto, \u201cFrom imagination to reality\u201d, when, in 1945, he proposed the use of satellites in geostationary orbits as communications relays. Clarke never patented the idea, but promoted it ceaselessly. Geostationary satellites have since revolutionized communications and weather forecasting, although Clarke's own dry assessment was that \u201cmy early disclosure may have advanced the cause of space communications by about fifteen minutes\u201d. In  Profiles of the Future  (1962), his elegantly phrased \u201cInquiry into the Limits of the Possible\u201d, Clarke balanced his scientific knowledge with his creativity to explore more comprehensively what might be achieved within the bounds of scientific laws. Books on futurology date notoriously fast, yet this one has not, perhaps because Clarke was unafraid of being adventurous. And many of his predictions have come to pass: he foresaw that mobile telecommunications would mean that no one could fully escape society, even at sea or on a mountain top. He went on to describe huge electronic libraries, the breakdown of censorship and high-definition electronic screens. Clarke favoured wise hopefulness, but saw dangers as well. His 1946 essay \u201cThe rocket and the future of warfare\u201d anticipated the essentials of nuclear war waged with intercontinental ballistic missiles, and called for measures to avoid it. At the time, many were concerned at the prospect of nuclear conflict (the United States proposed international regulation of nuclear weapons, although the Soviet Union refused to be drawn), but few had foreseen the fateful mating of the bomb and the rocket. Whether writing fiction or non-fiction, Clarke achieved a unique rendering of the aesthetic that combines the signal qualities of scientific endeavour: intelligence, tenacity and curiosity. His fiction has few villains, neglecting conflict and the broad spectrum of emotion. For Clarke's purposes these were pointless, even regrettable, diversions. A cool, analytical tone, springing from a pure, dispassionate statement of facts and relationships, pervades his writing. But the result is never cold, and indeed is often aphoristically witty. On religion: \u201cI don't believe in God, but I'm very interested in her.\u201d Of space and politics: \u201cThere is hopeful symbolism in the fact that flags do not wave in a vacuum.\u201d On progress: \u201cNew ideas pass through three periods: it can't be done; it probably can be done, but it's not worth doing; I knew it was a good idea all along.\u201d Undoubtedly Clarke's greatest success was his co-authorship, with Stanley Kubrick, of the film and novel  2001: A Space Odyssey.  The film's technological futurism, grounded in hard science, together with its iconic, mystical opening, made it a cultural benchmark and the embodiment of Clarke's assertion that \u201cwhatever other perils humanity may face in the future that lies ahead, boredom is not among them\u201d. Kubrick observed of Clarke: \u201cHe has the kind of mind of which the world can never have enough, an array of imagination, intelligence, knowledge and a quirkish curiosity, which often uncovers more than the first three qualities.\u201d Clarke later relished the story of an immigration official threatening to bar his entry to the United States until he had explained the ending of  2001 . Clarke moved permanently to Sri Lanka in 1956 to pursue one of his lifelong passions, scuba diving. He continued to dive even after he was partially confined to a wheelchair in the 1980s: he felt, he said, \u201cperfectly operational underwater\u201d. He founded Asia's first diving shop there, and restored the business after the 2004 tsunami. Sri Lanka gave Clarke creative isolation, but he was an early citizen of the global village, travelling and later keeping in touch with friends, colleagues and fans through daily e-mails. Surrounded by tropical cuisine, he never gave up his taste for a steady diet of English food, roast beef and Yorkshire pudding being a perennial favourite. His home in Sri Lanka contained a room he called the Ego Chamber. Amid the many awards stored there is a tribute from Apollo 11 astronaut Neil Armstrong that epitomizes Clarke's peculiar contribution to science: \u201cTo Arthur \u2014 who visualized the nuances of lunar flying before I experienced them.\u201d Up to the last, Clarke viewed humanity's ability to further expand its realm of experience, and so survive and prosper, with signature wry confidence. As he told a convention of the European Mars Society in 2002 via video-link from Sri Lanka: \u201cWhether we become a multi-planet species with unlimited horizons, or are for ever confined to Earth, will be decided in the twenty-first century amid the vast plains, rugged canyons and lofty mountains of Mars.\u201d Reprints and Permissions"},

Blumberg"}], "parsed_as_year": "2006_or_before", "body": "Decisive discoveries in bacterial genetics. I think it was 1941 when I first met Josh Lederberg. The location was the American Institute Science Laboratory in New York city, in the shadow of the Empire State Building. These labs were established to enable high-school students to conduct after-school research, and were an inspiring place for the science nerds of the time. Lederberg and I had much in common. We were born in the same year, spent much of our youthful spare time in branches of the New York Public Library, and were prompted to enter medical research by reading Paul de Kruif's  Microbe Hunters . Even then, his talent and energy marked him out. Lederberg, who died on 2 February 2008, became a brilliant biologist and an exceptional leader whose influence extended to space science and computing. He was educated at Stuyvesant High School, an \u00e9lite institution that produced four Nobel laureates in science, and then Columbia University. But before completing his medical education at Columbia he migrated to Yale University to do research. Inspired by Oswald Avery's discovery that DNA, not protein, is the genetic material in  Pneumococcus , he embarked on testing the widely held hypothesis that bacteria simply divide into two offspring from a single genome. Lederberg, however, showed that sexual reproduction occurs in  Escherichia coli , so revealing both an unexpected feature of microbial reproduction and providing an essential tool for genetic research and biotechnology. More was to come following the award of his PhD in 1947 and a move in that same year to the University of Wisconsin, Madison. Together with colleagues, including Esther Zimmer (to whom he was then married) and Norton Zinder, he discovered that viruses that infect bacteria can transfer genetic information between their hosts. This mechanism \u2014 transduction \u2014 was an unexpected way of altering the host's genetic make-up, and later assumed special significance with the recognition that viral sequences can be inserted in the human genome and can presumably be inherited. The discovery of transduction opened a vast area for research on the role of viruses in evolution and disease, and \u2014 even more intriguing \u2014 into the non-pathological characteristics of microorganisms. Another surprise was the finding that small, ring-shaped pieces of DNA, termed plasmids, reside in microbial cells and are distinct from chromosomal DNA, being capable of autonomous replication. Plasmids can be introduced into other cells to produce vast amounts of useful proteins such as human insulin and the hepatitis B virus vaccine. Lederberg's work was seminal in initiating a new approach to biology based on the genome and its interactions with the environment. This was recognized by the award of the Nobel prize in 1958, at the age of 33, which he shared with George Beadle and Edward Tatum. By then he was already widening his horizons, stimulated in particular by the launch of Sputnik on 4 October 1957. He was excited by the prospect of space exploration, but was also concerned about possible biological cross-contamination between Earth and other planetary bodies. In December 1957 he wrote to the US National Academy of Sciences (NAS) to warn of this danger. The eventual consequence was that objects and crews returning from Moon missions were subject to decontamination and quarantine. Lederberg was appointed as a founder member of the NAS Space Science Board in 1958, and continued to stimulate both professional and public interest in biological space research (particularly in his \u201cScience and Man\u201d columns in  The Washington Post ). He coined the word 'exobiology', which signalled the arrival of the discipline dedicated to the search for extraterrestrial life. This term was criticized as inappropriate, because there was no life known beyond Earth, and as designating a discipline without a subject. Its descendant discipline is 'astrobiology', a term often used interchangeably with exobiology. Astrobiology involves study of the origins of life on Earth, and testing the hypothesis that life exists elsewhere, maintaining Lederberg's vision of biology as an essential component of space research. His connection with space science became especially close when he was involved in planning, along with colleagues, experiments to be carried by the Viking landers to seek evidence of microbial life on Mars. The experiments consisted of the collection and spectrometric analysis of soil samples, and the landers commenced operations in 1976. The results were inconclusive, but they marked the beginning of a search that continues in the astrobiology programmes in the United States and elsewhere. Stimulated by his space research, Lederberg became a pioneer in the use of computers for biology and medical science. The DENDRAL program aided the determination of chemical structures from the spectrometric data collected on the Viking mission. Later, it was used to characterize structures of other compounds and was eventually applied to the organization and analysis of large biomedical data sets. This in turn led to medical 'expert systems', including INTERNIST, an expert system for clinical diagnosis and treatment. As if all of this were not enough, Lederberg took on senior management responsibilities at Stanford University, to which he moved in 1959, and other institutions, culminating in his appointment in 1978 as president of the Rockefeller University in New York. He served on various prominent committees and agencies, and was an adviser to many US presidential administrations. He was concerned about the hazards of biological warfare and was a consultant to the US Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, and served on the Defense Science Board, which advises the Department of Defense. He was also a member of the science advisory board of the NASA Astrobiology Institute, an intellectual offspring of his early interests in space biology. In 2006 he was awarded the US Presidential Medal of Freedom. As a researcher, Lederberg emphasized the importance of honesty and clarity in reporting scientific results. He recognized that science is a powerful problem-solving tool but that it has its limitations for individuals and society. His father was a rabbi and may have wanted his son to follow in his footsteps, which perhaps prompted Josh's awareness that acquiring knowledge is a blessing, yet comes laden with obligations. Scientists are not usually thought of as heroes. I write as an old friend and colleague, but to my mind Joshua Lederberg was just such a man. Through his far-ranging interests and achievements, often accomplished against entrenched opinions, he has left an enduring imprint on science. Reprints and Permissions"},

This distressing condition of premature ageing is a rare but fatal genetic disorder, which is caused by the continuous production of progerin, an abnormal form of the nuclear protein lamin A. But what effects does excess progerin have? Paola Scaffidi and Tom Misteli report that the protein triggers a feature that resembles premature ageing at a cellular level: untimely stem-cell differentiation (P. Scaffidi & T. Misteli  Nature Cell Biol.  doi:10.1038/ncb1708; 2008). The authors took a genome-wide approach to identify the genes concerned. They found that, 5 days after production of progerin was increased, the expression of almost 200 genes was dramatically affected, a number that rose to more than 1,000 by day 10. To interpret this striking effect, they searched for cellular pathways in which several progerin-responsive misregulated genes function; this led them to the Notch signalling cascade, which regulates stem-cell differentiation and cell fate. In cells derived from patients with HGPS, the components of Notch signalling were also abnormally active. The main tissues affected in HGPS are those of mesenchymal origin, including bone, fat and cartilage. The authors looked at the effect of progerin overexpression \u2014 and so Notch activation \u2014 on normal human mesenchymal stem cells and found that it led to sporadic but spontaneous differentiation of these cells. Next, they triggered differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells into specific lineages in the presence of progerin: increased stem-cell differentiation into the bone lineage was the result. By contrast, progerin seemed to hinder stem cells' transformation into fat cells. These results are consistent with the fact that patients with HGPS have a high turnover of bone but suffer from a loss of subcutaneous fat. Scaffidi and Misteli's work unravels at least some of the consequences of increased progerin levels associated with premature ageing. But their observations also have implications for understanding the normal process of ageing, as low levels of progerin are present in healthy individuals. Reprints and Permissions"},

C. Kendrew  et al . \u2014 Until five years ago, no one knew how, in practice, the complete structure of a crystalline protein might be found by X-rays, and it was realized that the methods then in vogue among protein crystallographers could at best give the most sketchy indications about the structure of the molecule. This situation was transformed by the discovery, made by Perutz and his colleagues, that heavy atoms could be attached to protein molecules in specific sites and that the resulting complexes gave diffraction patterns sufficiently different from normal to enable a classical method of structure analysis, the so-called 'method of isomorphous replacement', to be used to determine the relative phases of the reflexions ... The present article describes the application, at low resolution, of the isomorphous replacement method in three dimensions to type  A  crystals of sperm whale myoglobin. The result is a three-dimensional Fourier, or electron-density, map of the unit cell, which for the first time reveals the general nature of the tertiary structure of a protein molecule ... Perhaps the most remarkable features of the molecule are its complexity and its lack of symmetry. The arrangement ... is more complicated than has been predicated by any theory of protein structure.

The simple experiment is effective because it can be grasped completely, and the members of the audience have the pleasurable feeling that it has become a part of their own experience ... The other guiding principle of the popular lecture is that of starting with something with which the audience is thoroughly familiar in every-day life, and leading them further with that as a basis ...

Schistosomiasis \u2014 a tropical disease caused by flatworms of the genus  Schistosoma  \u2014 kills 280,000 people annually. Moreover, 200 million people are infected with the worm, and a further 800 million or so are at risk. An effective, low-cost drug called praziquantel is available. But it is heavily and regularly prescribed and, as there is currently no vaccine or alternative drug available, the danger of schistosome parasites evolving resistance to the drug is looming. So the discovery by Ahmed Sayed and colleagues, at Illinois State University in Normal and the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) in Bethesda, Maryland, of a drug that may be as effective as praziquantel, if not more so, is good news (A. A. Sayed  et al .  Nature Med.  doi:10.1038/nm1737; 2008). Within their human host, schistosome parasites reside in aerobic environments \u2014 skin, blood, lungs and liver. This means they must be able to avoid damage caused by reactive oxygen species. The authors therefore took advantage of a valuable resource \u2014 the NIH Chemical Genomics Center chemical repository \u2014 to screen thousands of compounds for their ability to target the antioxidant pathway in one of the most widespread of schistosome species,  Schistosoma mansoni  (pictured). The screen led to the identification of two groups of compounds, phosphinic amides and oxadiazole 2-oxides, which inhibit an enzyme known as TGR \u2014 a multifunctional agent that is uniquely responsible for the detoxification of reactive oxygen species in schistosome parasites. One oxadiazole called furoxan was particularly noteworthy for being highly potent at low doses. Furoxan did well in subsequent tests. The authors found that, within 24 hours, drug concentrations of just 10 micromolar killed 100% of adult  S. mansoni  grown in culture, and concentrations of 2 micromolar had the same effect over 5 days. Moreover, furoxan was active against two other worm species that also cause schistosomiasis. Human white blood cells produce nitric oxide, which can kill larval schistosomes. Sayed and colleagues show that, as well as inhibiting TGR activity, furoxan reacts with TGR to produce nitric oxide, increasing the compound's toxic effect on the parasite. The authors also tested the toxicity of furoxan in mouse cell lines and found that its toxicity is not very different from that of praziquantel. Investigating the efficacy of furoxan in overcoming schistosome infection in mice revealed that, depending on the stage in the life-cycle of  S. mansoni  at which the drug was administered, the disease burden was reduced by at least 88%. Such efficacy exceeds the criteria set by the World Health Organization for potential lead compounds for the treatment of schistosomiasis. Furoxan is thus a highly promising compound for use as an alternative or supplement to praziquantel \u2014 the two drugs function through different mechanisms. Efforts are already under way to generate furoxan derivatives suitable for use in humans. Reprints and Permissions"},

It is found that the marriage rate for women graduates is almost up to the normal, that they tend to be more fertile than average, that it takes some fifteen years before the last child is at school, that circumstances during the period of raising children give little opportunity for systematic intellectual pursuits or for an outside career, but that part-time teaching is the career most easily combined with family life ...

Identification of emerging-disease 'hotspots' will help target surveillance work. The steady stream of outbreaks of new or unexpected infectious diseases is a much-discussed issue in the field of public health 1 , 2  and has even acquired its own dedicated scientific journal 3 . But for many years research has generally taken a case-by-case approach to understanding why new infections emerge. Now, Jones  et al . 4  (page 990 of this issue) have published a systematic, quantitative analysis of recent global patterns of disease emergence. Their work provides insight into the ecology of emerging diseases, and has practical implications, providing pointers for the design of international surveillance programmes. Jones and her colleagues began by collating data on what they call emerging infectious disease 'events' \u2014 that is, outbreaks of human disease associated with a new species or variant of an infectious agent (which could be any type of pathogen, from a virus to a parasitic worm). A painstaking review of the literature going back to 1940 turned up more than 300 such events, most of them involving bacteria ( Box 1 ). (The database is published in full as supplementary information to the paper 4  and is itself a valuable resource.) The authors then quantified variation in the frequency of these events decade by decade across the world, and carried out a series of statistical analyses to look for relationships with other variables, ranging from human population growth to rainfall patterns. Before discussing their results, several issues that bedevil this kind of analysis should be acknowledged: how to define 'emerging' 5 ; choosing the appropriate taxonomic unit of study 6 ; making statistical allowance for groups of closely related pathogens sharing characteristics 7 ; and ascertainment or reporting bias 8 . There are no definitive solutions to these problems, but Jones  et al . fully explain and justify their approach, and are careful not to over-interpret their data. The frequency of events rose to a peak in the 1980s and has since fallen (despite rising reporting effort). Jones and colleagues suggest that the peak might reflect the onset of the AIDS pandemic, creating a large (and still expanding) population that is highly susceptible to concomitant infections. The raw data also suggest that most events occur at higher latitudes \u2014 and particularly in Europe and North America ( Box 1 ). This initially unexpected result is explained partly as an artefact of greater reporting effort, which, in turn, implies significant under-reporting in other parts of the world. Once reporting bias is accounted for, it becomes clear that, in general, most emerging infections are found where there are most people (rather than, as might have been supposed, on the remote fringes of human society). Beyond these general patterns, there were some variations between different types of infection. Zoonoses (human infections shared with other vertebrates) were the most important category, accounting for 60% of events. This conclusion echoes that of earlier studies on the animal origins of human disease over both ecological and evolutionary timescales 9 , 10 . Jones  et al . also confirm reports that zoonoses associated with wildlife were particularly important 11 , but go on to show that the frequency of such events correlated with mammalian species richness (by contrast, no such correlation was found for infections associated with domestic animals). This result is neatly consistent with two previous observations: first, that many emerging pathogens have a broad host range 12 ; and second, that a wide range of other mammals (and some birds) is associated with novel human pathogens 13 . Jones  et al . 4  also stress the importance of drug-resistant infections. These account for more than 20% of events, mostly involving bacteria, and are especially common at higher latitudes \u2014 that is, in more developed regions where the use of antimicrobials is presumed to be greatest. Another major category is vector-borne infections. These also account for more than 20% of events and are currently on the increase, possibly linked to climate change, although other explanations cannot be ruled out. Clearly, we must expect more infectious diseases to emerge in the near future. Jones and colleagues extrapolate their statistical analysis to generate risk maps that correct for current biases in reporting effort. The maps suggest that there are potential 'hotspots' of disease emergence \u2014 particularly in central America, tropical Africa and south Asia \u2014 that warrant greater surveillance. These findings support calls for international investment in the capacity to detect, identify and monitor infectious diseases, targeted at regions of the world where the need is greatest 14 . The benefits would not just be felt locally: in an era of increasing globalization, emerging infectious diseases are everybody's problem. Reprints and Permissions"},

Levin"}, {"name": "George Sugihara"}], "parsed_as_year": "2006_or_before", "body": "There is common ground in analysing financial systems and ecosystems, especially in the need to identify conditions that dispose a system to be knocked from seeming stability into another, less happy state. 'Tipping points', 'thresholds and breakpoints', 'regime shifts' \u2014 all are terms that describe the flip of a complex dynamical system from one state to another. For banking and other financial institutions, the Wall Street Crash of 1929 and the Great Depression epitomize such an event. These days, the increasingly complicated and globally interlinked financial markets are no less immune to such system-wide (systemic) threats. Who knows, for instance, how the present concern over sub-prime loans will pan out? Well before this recent crisis emerged, the US National Academies/National Research Council and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York collaborated 1  on an initiative to \u201cstimulate fresh thinking on systemic risk\u201d. The main event was a high-level conference held in May 2006, which brought together experts from various backgrounds to explore parallels between systemic risk in the financial sector and in selected domains in engineering, ecology and other fields of science. The resulting report 1  was published late last year and makes stimulating reading. Catastrophic changes in the overall state of a system can ultimately derive from how it is organized \u2014 from feedback mechanisms within it, and from linkages that are latent and often unrecognized. The change may be initiated by some obvious external event, such as a war, but is more usually triggered by a seemingly minor happenstance or even an unsubstantial rumour. Once set in motion, however, such changes can become explosive and afterwards will typically exhibit some form of hysteresis, such that recovery is much slower than the collapse. In extreme cases, the changes may be irreversible. As the report 1  emphasizes, the potential for such large-scale catastrophic failures is widely applicable: for global climate change, as the greenhouse blanket thickens; for 'ecosystem services', as species are removed; for fisheries, as stocks are overexploited; and for electrical grids or the Internet, as increasing demands are placed on both. With its eye ultimately on the banking system, the report concentrates on the possibility of finding common principles and lessons learned within this medley of interests. For instance, to what extent can mechanisms that enhance stability against inevitable minor fluctuations, in inflation, interest rates or share price for example, in other contexts perversely predispose towards full-scale collapse? Two particularly illuminating questions about priorities in risk management emerge from the report. First, how much money is spent on studying systemic risk as compared with that spent on conventional risk management in individual firms? Second, how expensive is a systemic-risk event to a national or global economy (examples being the stock market crash of 1987, or the turmoil of 1998 associated with the Russian loan default, and the subsequent collapse of the hedge fund Long-Term Capital Management)? The answer to the first question is \u201ccomparatively very little\u201d; to the second, \u201chugely expensive\u201d. An analogous situation exists within fisheries management. For the past half-century, investments in fisheries science have focused on management on a species-by-species basis (analogous to single-firm risk analysis). Especially with collapses of some major fisheries, however, this approach is giving way to the view that such models may be fundamentally incomplete, and that the wider ecosystem and environmental context (by analogy, the full banking and market system) are required for informed decision-making. It is an example of a trend in many areas of applied science acknowledging the need for a larger-system perspective. But to what extent can study of ecosystems inform the design of financial networks in, for instance, their robustness against perturbation? Ecosystems are robust by virtue of their continued existence. They have survived eons of change \u2014 continental drift, climate fluctuations, movement and evolution of constituent species \u2014 and show some remarkable constancies in structure that have apparently persisted for hundreds of millions of years: witness, for example, the constancy in predator\u2013prey ratios in different situations 2 . Identifying structural attributes shared by these diverse systems that have survived rare systemic events, or have indeed been shaped by them, could provide clues about which characteristics of complex systems correlate with a high degree of robustness. An example of this kind emerges from work on the network structure of communities of pollinators and the plants they pollinate 3 . These networks are disassortative, in the sense that highly connected 'large' nodes tend to have their connections disproportionately with 'small' nodes; conversely, small nodes connect with disproportionately few large ones. The authors 3  show that such disassortative networks tend to confer a significant degree of stability against disturbance. More generally, ecologists and others have long suggested that modularity \u2014 the degree to which the nodes of a system can be decoupled into relatively discrete components \u2014 can promote robustness. Thus, a basic principle in the management of forest fires and epidemics is that if there is strong interconnection among all elements, a perturbation will encounter nothing to stop it from spreading. But once the system is appropriately compartmentalized \u2014 by firebreaks, or vaccination of 'superspreaders' \u2014 disturbance or risk is more easily countered. As the report 1  notes, this is a complicated question, because modularity will often involve a trade-off between local and systemic risk. Moreover, the wrong compartmentalization in financial markets could preclude stabilizing feedbacks, such as mechanisms for maintaining liquidity of cash flows through the financial system, where fragmentation leading to illiquidity could actually increase systemic risk (as in the bank runs leading to the Great Depression). Redundancy of components and pathways, in which one can substitute for another, is also a key element in the robustness of complex systems, and effective redundancy is not independent of modularity. In short, the dynamical implications of the topology of financial networks emerge as good candidates for further research. This is a lively field: the interplay between network topology and random or targeted 'attack' has also provided insights for the control of infectious diseases 4  and the defence of networks such as the Internet 5 . Following this theme, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York commissioned a study 6  of the topology of interbank payment flows within the US Fedwire service ( Fig. 1 ); this is a real-time settlement system, operated by the Federal Reserve System, within which some 9,500 participating banks transfer funds. The sample from this network amounted to around 700,000 transfers, with just over 5,000 banks involved on an average day (ecologists studying food webs can only dream of such high-quality data). The authors 6  find the connectivity of this network \u2014 the ratio of the number of banks or nodes connected by one or more transfers to the total number of possible connections (essentially 0.5 n 2 , where  n  is the number of banks) \u2014 is very low, around 0.003. This connectivity is characterized by a relatively small number of strong flows (many transfers) between nodes, with the vast majority of linkages being weak to zero (few to no flows). On a daily basis, 75% of the payment flows involve fewer than 0.1% of the nodes, and only 0.3% of the observed linkages between nodes (which are already extremely sparse). This kind of inequitability in linkage strengths (with most links being weak) is thought to predominate and help stabilize some ecological networks. Overall, the topology of this Fedwire network is highly disassortative: large banks were disproportionately connected to small banks, and vice versa; the average bank was connected to 15 others, but this does not give an accurate idea of the reality in which most banks have only a few connections while a small number of 'hubs' have thousands. These strongly nonrandom and disassortative characteristics of the bank-transfer network are, as noted above, shared by some ecological systems. They also resonate with theoretical studies suggesting that sparseness of strong linkages can confer greater stability in systems whose components (nodes, banks, species) have some self-regulation 7 , 8 . These insights must be viewed against the reality that the payments system may not always be the relevant network for understanding systemic events. As the report notes, political and social networks may emerge to play a larger role in liquidity transactions and/or in the spread of rumours, which can ultimately influence the tides of fear and greed, and thence consensus valuation of markets. In this way the ever-changing finance problem, despite having certain resemblances to that posed in understanding ecosystems, is different from the fixed networks considered in physical sciences. The report puts it succinctly: \u201cthe odds on a 100-year storm do not change because people think that such a storm has become more likely\u201d. Emphasizing the point is this observation 1 : \u201c... in contrast to management of the electric power grid, there are only coarse or indirect options for control of the financial system. The tools available to policymakers \u2014 such as those used by central banks \u2014 are designed to modify individual incentives and individual behaviors in ways that will support the collective good. Such top-down efforts to influence individual behaviors can often be effective, but it is still difficult to control the spread of panic behavior or to manage financial crises in an optimal way. Within the financial system, robustness is something that emerges; it cannot be engineered.\u201d Thus, although the study of payment flows is of immediate interest to central bankers, it may miss an essential aspect of systemic risk, namely the 'contagion dynamics' of public perceptions and asset valuation associated with the interaction of balance-sheets (the mutual financial obligations and exposures that link companies). For example, how contagious are inflated valuations of Internet stocks? Are there hidden, mutually dependent risks associated with such high valuations? It could be useful to examine the dynamic network of balance-sheets, and if possible to quantify the inter active effects of valuations, credit policies, hedging and so on among financial institutions, especially investment banks. Such balance-sheet networks could be helpful in studying the effects of asset-pricing bubbles, credit crises and the poorly understood but potentially worrying effects of the current widespread use of derivatives (futures and options) and dynamic hedging by investment banks to manage risk on the fly. Whatever the case, it seems that the ephemeral networks that define financial reality and global markets are a key to understanding the ecology of market robustness and its potential vulnerability to collapse.

The cost has been the degradation of vital ecosystems \u2014 a cost borne disproportionately by the world's poor. Through our rapacious exploitation, ecosystems and the benefits they bring to us are disappearing at an unprecedented and alarming rate. Qualitative evidence suggests that the rich world is profiting from this process, whereas poorer countries are bearing the brunt of the resulting environmental degradation. Srinivasan  et al . 1 , writing in  Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , provide a quantitative basis for that claim, calculating the distribution of costs and benefits over a range of indicators of ecosystem change. The results might, in an ideal world, lead to a radical reassessment of who is in debt to whom. Measured in terms of gross domestic product (GDP), the size of the world's economy has doubled almost three times since 1950. But the proposition that aggregate economic growth alone is the most important and powerful force for human progress and poverty reduction has increasingly been questioned 2 , 3 . Economic growth fuelled by international trade relies on the consumption of heavily advertised and marketed goods and services. Poorer people and the natural world, marginalized by the market economy, lose out. Besides basic economic needs, a high quality of human life must include satisfactory human relationships, communities, freedoms and opportunities 4 , 5 . Well-functioning ecosystems are even more fundamental. The buzz-word is 'ecosystem services': the favours such as food and fuel; protection from storms, disease and solar radiation; regulation of water and climate; creation of soils; and inspiration for art, literature, religion and culture that the natural world bestows on us. Current economic models undervalue this provision, because many ecosystem services are 'public goods', historically provided for free. This leaves them prone to overexploitation, a trend exacerbated by global population growth: 15 of the 24 ecosystem services identified in the seminal Millennium Ecosystem Assessment initiated by the United Nations in 2001 were found to be in decline at the global scale 6 . The current political focus on climate change has brought this pressure on our ecological support systems into sharper relief. Sustaining ecosystem processes is all the more difficult because many change abruptly and nonlinearly when pressed beyond a certain threshold. Qualitative or context- and case-specific evidence indicates that poorer countries bear most of this pressure 7 . An example is the widespread conversion of tropical mangrove forests to shrimp aquaculture. These farms supply Europe and North America with cheap shrimp, but nearby residents must pay the costs: the loss of the storm regulation, fish nurseries, and fuel and fibre sources that the mangrove forests provided 8 . This type of unequal exchange has been termed an 'ecological debt' owed by rich countries to the poor 7 . As raw materials \u2014 whether they be shrimp, palm oil, or crude oil and gas \u2014 become scarcer, and exploitation of them advances into new territories, this debt will probably increase. The prices at which exports are sold do not include compensation for the goods' local \u2014 or sometimes global \u2014 environmental costs. That problem is exacerbated by rich countries' disproportionate use of environmental sinks, such as the atmosphere, to take up their higher carbon emissions. Srinivasan  et al . 1  present for the first time a global-scale quantitative analysis of the distribution of major environmental costs across nations in three income groups: low (representing 32% of the world's population), middle (50%) and high (18%). The timescale of the study is 1961\u20132000, and it covers six categories of environmental change: climate change; stratospheric ozone depletion; agricultural intensification and expansion; deforestation; overfishing; and mangrove conversion. In the case of climate change, the authors calculate that nations in the low, middle and high income groups were responsible for 13%, 45% and 42% of greenhouse-gas emissions, respectively. The resulting climate damages were estimated to be distributed 29%, 45% and 25%. The same pattern of cost transfer to the poorest nations is observed for ozone depletion, overfishing and aquaculture. In the case of agricultural change and deforestation, the authors find that arguably the costs were largely generated and borne within nations. When the figures for the six categories are aggregated and adjusted for different currency purchasing power, the low-income group of nations bears 20% of the total costs, the middle-income group 60% and the high-income group 20%. Taking into account equity weighting (the fact that a unit of income is not the same to a poor as to a rich person, making costs a heavier burden to shoulder) the percentages are 45%, 52% and 3%. A significant proportion of the cost burden of the low-income group is caused by the activities of the other groups: looking at climate-change damage alone, rich countries might already have imposed costs on poor countries greater than the poor countries' existing foreign debt. The people bearing these costs include the one billion or so who already lack daily access to safe drinking water, electricity, secure food supplies and basic education. Several caveats are needed to put these striking results into context. First, any study is only as good as the available data. Globally robust data sets on environmental externalities are incomplete, and therefore the results are indicative, not absolute. Some significant environmental changes have been omitted: the destruction of coral reefs, the dispersal of persistent pollutants and the costs of biodiversity loss. The authors are up-front about these limitations. But they justly suggest that the omissions indicate that their estimates of ecological debts are conservative. Furthermore, the study does not look at the benefits of increased trade to material wealth and human health. But it is unlikely that this would change the balance of the results: the available, albeit partial, evidence indicates that, despite some gains by poorer countries through the liberalization of trade and finance, the number of people living in poverty has increased or stayed the same during the past 25 years, and the gains of economic globalization have been heavily skewed towards wealthy nations 2  ( Fig. 1 ). One of the most detailed studies on global inequality concludes 9  that income divergence between rich and poor nations has \u201cat best ... decelerated after 1950, but [has] not reversed\u201d. Large areas of Central and South America, and almost all of sub-Saharan Africa, have been left behind. Srinivasan and colleagues' work 1  should raise the scientific profile of issues vital to human well-being, including research into ecosystem services and the effects of large-scale ecosystem conversion, and how such changes both create and alleviate poverty. We must better understand the complex interactions between our economic, social and ecological systems, and the biological diversity that supports them. Scientists and society as a whole need to ask of our current economic paradigms in an era of globalization: why do they produce such inequities; who pays the costs; and are they ecologically and socially sustainable?

Concerns about the effects of increasing levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide on climate and ocean acidity have intensified the study of how carbon is exchanged between the atmosphere, land and oceans \u2014 especially how CO 2  is removed from the atmosphere and transferred into long-term storage (sinks). The rates of removal into terrestrial and ocean sinks seem to be slowing down 1 , highlighting the need for improved data on the individual sinks, their controls and likely future behaviour, and their relationship to other carbon fluxes. In the global carbon cycle, rivers are a fundamental, multi-faceted link between atmosphere, land and ocean 2 , 3 . Five years ago, a study 3  of the Mississippi River in the United States found a large increase in the export of dissolved inorganic carbon to the ocean during the past 50 years, a result of the enhanced dissolution (weathering) of rock minerals. Links to changing agricultural practices and crop management, as well as to increased precipitation, were found, but the mechanisms remained unclear. On  page 449  of this issue, Raymond  et al . 4  revisit this topic using a remarkable, century-long data set and more robust approaches. They conclude that direct effects from changes in land use outweigh the indirect influence of climate change. The chemical weathering of rock material in soils typically consumes CO 2  of atmospheric origin through reactions with carbonate and silicate minerals. These reactions are controlled by factors including climate, mineral type, the availability of acids (particularly carbonic acid) and physical erosion 5 . The resulting bicarbonate ion (HCO 3 \u2212 ) is the dominant form of dissolved inorganic carbon in most rivers, and does not exchange readily with atmospheric CO 2 . Instead, it is transported by water run-off to rivers and, ultimately, to the ocean, where it contributes to the ocean's alkalinity \u2014 and so its capacity to absorb CO 2  and buffer changes in acidity. The weathering of silicate rocks such as basalt and granite results in complete conversion of consumed CO 2  to bicarbonate in soils and groundwater, and the weathering of carbonates such as limestone converts one molecule of mineral CO 2  to bicarbonate for each molecule of atmospheric CO 2  consumed 5 . Overall, chemical weathering is a sink of CO 2  on land, and represents a transfer of atmospheric carbon and buffering capacity to the ocean at timescales relevant to human activity (hundreds to thousands of years). But in all this, human alterations of weathering fluxes through land management had typically been neglected in large-scale assessments. Raymond  et al . 4  exploit alkalinity measurements taken at the water-treatment plants that supply the city of New Orleans with drinking water drawn from the Mississippi. Combined with information about river discharge from the US Geological Survey, these data provide an extraordinary 100-year record of monthly variability in water and bicarbonate export from North America's largest river. They show little change before the 1950s, but confirm the approximately 40% increase in bicarbonate export over the past 50 years previously assessed using an independent record 3 . To investigate the factors driving this increased annual flux, Raymond  et al . separate out two possible mechanisms. First, there are increases in water discharge that increase total amounts of bicarbonate export, but imply no change in bicarbonate concentration. Second, there are increases in bicarbonate flux at equivalent discharge values, representing net increases in mean bicarbonate concentration. The authors assess this second effect by normalizing annual bicarbonate flux to the long-term mean annual water discharge. They conclude that more than 60% of the increased bicarbonate flux results from increased concentrations, and not mainly from increased water discharge as was previously thought 3 . Alterations in how the watersheds of the Mississippi basin work seem to have driven the increased bicarbonate discharges of the past 50 years. This period coincides with agricultural intensification, and changes in crop type and land-management practices in the basin. One must bear in mind, however, that the data from New Orleans, near the mouths of the Mississippi, provide only a highly aggregated picture. So Raymond  et al . 4  turn to an extensive sub-watershed data set of bicarbonate discharge, land use and precipitation distribution to probe the role of cropland extent, changes in hydrology and increased precipitation. They find that increases in discharge in agricultural \u2014 but not grassland or forested \u2014 watersheds outpaced increases in precipitation. This conclusion agrees with recent hydrological studies 6  that found that agricultural changes in the Mississippi basin, especially the expansion of soya-bean row crops, might be reducing evapotranspiration and increasing the fraction of precipitation that reaches the groundwater and flows to streams ( Fig. 1 ). Together with practices such as liming soil to neutralize acidity, this enhanced flow through deeper mineral-rich soils results in increased bicarbonate exports from agricultural areas. The authors suggest that more than 50% of the total increase in bicarbonate export in the past 50 years results from the direct effect of land-use changes. The influence of precipitation increase and CO 2  fertilization from atmospheric CO 2  increase is comparatively small. Agriculturally driven hydrological alterations will, however, magnify the effect of precipitation increases. Does enhanced weathering tip croplands into becoming a net sink of atmospheric CO 2  in comparison with the situation in pristine ecosystems such as forests or grasslands? The answer is complex. First, the acceleration of weathering reported by Raymond  et al . 4  is probably limited to mineral-rich soils and particular agricultural practices. More importantly, other direct human pressures must be considered. Besides the removal of biomass during conversion from pristine ecosystems, agricultural activities commonly lead to enhanced erosion of soils and loss of associated organic carbon, providing a potential source of CO 2  to the atmosphere through oxidation downstream 2 . Sedimentation in the reservoirs that are often built to support irrigation can, on the other hand, serve as a long-term sink for eroded-soil organic carbon 2 . Consequently, the net global effect of agricultural soil erosion on atmospheric CO 2  remains contentious 2 , 7 . Land-management effects on river-carbon exports should be considered in parallel with the more extensively studied effects on nutrient exports. The Mississippi basin represents a notable example of both 8 . An intensification of groundwater flow and bicarbonate flux analogous to, but of smaller magnitude than, that highlighted by Raymond  et al . seems to be occurring in some Arctic basins. Here, it is an effect of climate change on freeze\u2013thaw cycles and permafrost coverage 9 . Thus, changes in chemical weathering caused both by direct human alterations and by the indirect effects of climate change seem to be a more significant component of regional and global perturbations of the carbon cycle than was thought. This latest study 4  adds to mounting evidence that the levels of carbon export from developed watersheds today might not be representative of conditions before pressures such as intensive agriculture and acid deposition from industrial emissions became widespread 10 . Long biogeochemical time-series such as that from the New Orleans water-treatment stations are invaluable tools for discerning what the dominant controls on river-carbon exports are, and how they respond to large-scale human activities.

As the first chair of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), and one of the first scientists to understand the environmental impact of carbon dioxide produced by human activities, Bert Bolin left an indelible mark. A pioneer of climate science, he died in Stockholm on 30 December 2007, aged 82. Bolin was born in Nyk\u00f6ping, Sweden, on 15 May 1925. He completed his PhD at the University of Stockholm in 1956, and was within five years professor of meteorology there \u2014 a post he held until his retirement in 1990. During that time, he published more than 160 papers related to the meteorology and chemistry of the atmosphere, contributing to an improved understanding of numerical weather models and acid deposition. As early as the 1950s, Bolin started to study the natural carbon cycle. His fundamental research advanced our understanding of the fate and transformations of carbon dioxide, not only in the atmosphere, but also in the oceans and in the terrestrial biosphere. He was among the first scientists to recognize the significance of changes in ecosystems for atmospheric carbon dioxide, and that deforestation in particular was contributing to the observed increase. He was also one of the first to go public with his concerns: in May 1959, he travelled to Washington DC to warn the National Academy of Sciences that a 25% increase in carbon dioxide in Earth's atmosphere by the end of the century could have serious consequences for the temperature of the planet. Bolin rapidly acquired a reputation as an eminent organizer and leader of cross-border scientific collaborations. In 1963, he became involved in setting up an international effort to study the general circulation of the atmosphere. This work led to the formation of the International Council for Science's (ICSU's) committee on atmospheric sciences in 1964, of which Bolin became the first chair. That committee's work resulted in the establishment three years later, by ICSU and the World Meteorological Organization, of the Global Atmospheric Research Program \u2014 GARP. The timing of this move was especially significant: the availability of the first information on Earth from space was exciting meteorologists across the world, owing to the unprecedented opportunity it offered to study the atmosphere as a whole. This ambitious goal was supported by the rapidly growing potential of computers to perform large-scale modelling. Bolin chaired GARP from 1968 to 1971, bringing together scientists from around the world at the height of the cold war. Under his aegis, GARP became an acclaimed international research programme that contributed much to our understanding of weather and climate. In 1983, Bolin began a project supported by the United Nations Environment Programme to explore the links between the physical climate system and global ecosystems. The result was the foundation, under the auspices of ICSU, of the International Geosphere\u2013Biosphere Programme, which brought about a new level of integration between physical, chemical and biological perspectives of the global ecosystem. Bolin's particular insight was to comprehend the magnitude of the problems faced by the scientific community in working across disciplinary boundaries, as well as to envisage how these problems might be solved. These were qualities that served him well in the role for which he will undoubtedly be best remembered \u2014 as the first chair of the IPCC, from 1988 to 1998. His reputation as a brilliant and honest scientist, who listened to and respected diverse views, attracted the best and the brightest of the scientific community to the IPCC, and the fledgling panel rapidly gained the attention of the politicians to whom its reports were addressed. Bolin's quiet, soft-spoken style earned him the trust and respect not just of government officials who already recognized the threat of human-induced climate change, but also of those who vehemently challenged the idea that Earth's climate was even changing, let alone whether humans were involved. These same 'soft' skills helped him nurture talent in his own research team in Stockholm, where he was a mentor to many young researchers who have since become leading climate scientists. Rarely does a single individual change the world, but Bolin's work as a scientist, as an organizer of major international research programmes and as leader of the IPCC has certainly changed the way we think about the world. That we are now aware of the potentially catastrophic impact of human activities on Earth's climate, and of the need to make the transition to a low-carbon economy and to protect our natural forests, is in no small part down to him. Without his leadership of the IPCC, the 1992 Rio de Janeiro Framework Convention on Climate Change and the 1997 Kyoto Protocol would have taken longer to negotiate. His vision was central to all of the achievements for which the IPCC was jointly awarded the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize along with the former US vice-president Al Gore. Bolin was by then too ill to attend the ceremony but, as Gore wrote to him: \u201cBert, without you we would not have come to where we are today.\u201d Brilliant yet humble, Bert Bolin was an excellent communicator, a leader despite his natural shyness, and one who always gave credit to others rather than to himself. A world-class scientist, a man of great integrity, a great organizer and an inveterate optimist, he was above all a nice guy who just enjoyed singing in his choir at home in Sweden. Isaac Newton famously said that we in science all stand on the shoulders of giants. For those of us who knew and worked with Bert at the IPCC, he above all was the giant upon whose shoulders we stood. Reprints and Permissions"},

Voytas"}], "parsed_as_year": "2006_or_before", "body": "Mobile genetic elements called transposons could cause havoc in the genome if left unregulated. Of the various cellular defence strategies used to preserve genome integrity, one involves exploiting transposons themselves. The college sophomores in my genetics class become visibly uncomfortable during my lectures on transposable elements. \u201cYou mean to tell me there are things jumping around my genome?\u201d they ask when I explain that much of their genetic material is made up of DNA segments that can move about their chromosomes. The mobility of transposable elements is understandably disconcerting, because it would be expected to lead to chromosome rearrangements and mutations that could cause disease. In the long term, however, these elements are probably beneficial, serving as a powerful force for genome change and evolution. Although the long-term view may do little to appease a 20-year-old, my students can take some comfort in the findings of Cam  et al . 1  reported in this issue ( page 431 ). The authors show that, in the fission yeast  Schizosaccharomyces pombe , proteins called CENP-Bs are drafted in to quell transposon activity. What is unusual about this particular choice is that CENP-Bs themselves are derived from transposable elements. CENP-Bs were first discovered because they bind to repetitive DNA sequences called centromeres 2 . During cell division, centromeres assemble proteins to serve as anchor points for the spindle fibres that move chromosomes to the daughter cells. Fission yeast has three closely related CENP-Bs that bind to centromeres and that are crucial for centromere function 3 . Cam  et al . wanted to know whether CENP-Bs also associate with genomic regions other than centromeres. They found that, indeed, CENP-Bs occur at dispersed DNA repeats, particularly at the Tf2 transposable elements that litter the  S. pombe  genome. The authors show that CENP-Bs bind to Tf2 and recruit enzymes known as histone deacetylases, which turn off Tf2 expression and prevent transposition. The silenced Tf2 elements are then packaged into subdomains of the nucleus called Tf bodies ( Fig. 1 ). But transposition can on rare occasions be advantageous, particularly in times of stress, as it has the ability to create potentially beneficial genetic variants 4 . When Cam and colleagues exposed  S. pombe  cells to oxidative stress, Tf2 elements became unbundled from Tf bodies and were expressed ( Fig. 1 ). Furthermore, in cells lacking certain CENP-Bs, the Tf2-related element Tf1 was mobilized, making new insertions that were then packaged into Tf bodies. These observations indicate that CENP-Bs regulate Tf activity through selective packaging. The CENP-B proteins are an unexpected choice for combating mobile elements because they originate from transposase 5 , the enzyme necessary for cutting and pasting DNA during transposition. The transposase progenitor of CENP-Bs belongs to a class of mobile element that is unrelated to Tf2. The authors argue that this unrelatedness suggests a conflict between different classes of mobile element, but this view is probably unnecessarily provocative. As transposases normally bind to DNA, they are suited to being moulded over time into genome regulators. In the case of CENP-B, the vestigial DNA-binding domain of the transposase recognizes centromeric repeats and Tf2 elements. So, whereas CENP-Bs can no longer cut and paste DNA, they can recruit histone deacetylases to regulate Tf2. Other transposase-derived proteins also act as gene regulators. For example, two transcriptional activators used by plants in their response to light are derived from transposases 6 , and it is speculated that many such transposase-derived proteins serve crucial roles in gene regulation 7 . Vertebrates also have CENP-Bs, which, like their  S. pombe  counterparts, bind to centromeres, and were only recently shown 8  to contribute to centromere function. The vertebrate proteins also act on centromeric DNA repeats integrated on chromosomes outside the centromere. At these non-centromeric sites, the repeats become tightly packaged into transcriptionally inert protein\u2013DNA complexes called heterochromatin in a way that is analogous to the action of CENP-Bs on the Tf2 elements of  S. pombe . It is not known whether CENP-Bs also regulate the activity of vertebrate transposable elements, or how the different roles of CENP-Bs in centromere formation and heterochromatin assembly are assigned. Nonetheless, this emerging story suggests a general role for CENP-Bs in helping the cell to manage its burden of repetitive DNA. The packaging of transposable elements into transcriptionally inactive chromatin is not a defensive strategy limited to CENP-Bs. RNA interference also serves as a surveillance mechanism for double-stranded RNAs that result from the transcription of clustered or scrambled arrays of transposable elements 9 . This process leads to the degradation of messenger RNA transcripts of mobile elements, thus diminishing their activity. RNA interference also assembles mobile elements into heterochromatin, similar to the action of CENP-Bs on centromeric repeats and transposable elements. Of course, the war between transposable elements and their host genome has been going on for millennia, allowing defensive strategies to assume other roles. The RNA-interference machinery in  S. pombe , for example, has only a modest impact on Tf2 expression 10 , yet it is essential for the formation of heterochromatin at centromeric repeats, and is thus important for centromere function 11 . Also, a particularly remarkable finding of Cam  et al . 1  is that CENP-Bs regulate the expression of some genes adjacent to sites of Tf2 insertion. This indicates that CENP-Bs and transposable elements collaborate to create genetic diversity, which could benefit the cell. The relationship between transposable elements and their host cell is made more complex by combative strategies that affect regular cellular functions. Undoubtedly, the future holds more surprises about the conflicts and collaborations between mobile elements and their host cell that contribute to genome function. Reprints and Permissions"},

At just the right dye proportions, a low-cost, highly efficient source of white light is the result. If you have ever wondered what makes that ghostly colour in the light sticks used by trick-or-treaters on a Hallowe'en night, wonder no more: a typical answer might be a fluorescing organic molecule such as 5,6,11,12-tetraphenyltetracene, also known as rubrene. Writing in  Advanced Materials , Zhao  et al . 1  describe how they used such organic molecules to make white-light-emitting composite nanocrystals that are visible only under a microscope. Cute as these lilliputian light sticks are, they might also point the way to a new generation of light sources. A typical light stick contains two chemicals: hydrogen peroxide and a phenyl oxalate ester. When these two substances are mixed, energy is released. That energy excites a suitable fluorescent dye, causing it to emit a photon. The wavelength of the photon, and so the colour of the emitted light, depends on the structure of the dye ( Fig. 1a ). Rubrene, for example, is an orange-emitter; the related molecule 1,3,5-triphenyl-2-pyrazoline (TPP) is blue. Zhao  et al . 1  use a process called physical vapour deposition, which is a common way of making organic nanocrystals, to co-evaporate rubrene and TPP at 200\u2013300 \u00b0C and condense them onto a substrate at a lower temperature. The result is a collection of uniform organic nanorods with diameters of hundreds of nanometres and lengths of several micrometres ( Fig. 1b ). Each nanorod functions as a tiny light stick, with its colour determined by the molecular ratio of the two organic dyes. The energy-transfer mechanism in these nanorods is known as intermolecular fluorescence resonance energy transfer (IFRET), and is fundamentally different from that of a typical light stick. In a typical IFRET process 2 , energy is absorbed by one fluorescent molecule (blue-emitting TPP in Zhao and colleagues' case), and transferred non-radiatively to another fluorescent molecule (orange-emitting rubrene). Consequently, the emission of the first molecule is quenched, and the emission of the second is enhanced. The efficiency of this process depends sensitively on the degree of electronic coupling between the two molecules. In an amorphous thin film, for example, where TPP and rubrene molecules are intimately mixed, the emission of TPP can be almost completely quenched with a very small amount of rubrene. The nanorods prepared by Zhao  et al . show an intermediate degree of IFRET owing to an unusual structural feature: as X-ray diffraction studies reveal, the rubrene nanocrystals are uniformly embedded in a crystalline TPP matrix. This results in incomplete quenching of the blue emission from TPP, even with decent levels of rubrene 'doping', leading to colour mixing of the orange and blue emissions. Importantly, at the proper molecular ratio, it becomes possible to generate stable white light. Among researchers investigating comparable lighting devices based on inorganic semiconductors, this kind of colour tunability is often achieved by using homogeneous mixtures of different compounds. A good example is recent research into indium gallium nitride (InGaN) materials, which are considered excellent candidates for solid-state lighting applications. Here, a mixture of indium nitride and gallium nitride is used to systematically shift the emission of the materials from ultraviolet wavelengths to the near-infrared 3 . Similarly, doping has commonly been used in organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), both to tune their emission colour and to improve their luminescence efficiency 4 . Many of these doping studies have used amorphous thin films, in which charge carriers have low mobility. Zhao and colleagues' composite organic nanorods not only represent an unusual source of stable white light, but, because of their ordered crystalline natures, should offer better transport properties, and hence better optoelectronic performance. Single crystalline nanowires of the aromatic hydrocarbon hexathiapentacene have been shown to have charge-carrier mobilities almost ten times those of more disordered thin-film structures 5 . To sound a note of caution, however, the emission efficiency of these composite nanorods has yet to be determined. Their integration into a functional electroluminescent device must also be demonstrated. Because of the great tunability of both their crystal and their electronic structures, inorganic semiconductor nanowires have proved to be workhorses of nanoscale science and engineering 6 , finding applications in various electronic, photonic and sensing devices. Considering the vast number of optically and electronically active organic molecules, the organic version of the nanowires could reasonably be expected to have similar potential \u2014 and indeed, they are already being considered for devices such as transistors, LEDs and photovoltaic cells. Their one-dimensional nanostructures offer the additional advantage of being mechanically flexible, making them particularly appealing for flexible optoelectronic applications: a hexathiapentacene nanowire transistor, for instance, suffers no significant loss in performance when placed under mechanical stress 5 . Just as with their inorganic counterparts, several important optical properties have already been demonstrated in organic nanowires, including lasing 7 , waveguiding 8 , nonlinear optical mixing 9  and polarized emission 10 . With Zhao  et al . 1  adding colour tunability to the list, the nanowires seem to have a bright, white future ahead. Reprints and Permissions"},

Seymour Benzer, one of the giants of twentieth-century biology, died on 30 November. Benzer, who maintained an active laboratory until the time of his death, was a unique figure who made seminal contributions to physics, molecular biology and behavioural genetics. He was born in New York to immigrant Jewish parents from Poland, and grew up in Brooklyn. After graduating from Brooklyn College, he obtained his PhD in physics from Purdue University in 1947, where his discoveries in solid-state physics contributed to the development of the transistor. Relentlessly curious, Benzer possessed both a single-minded fascination with the mysteries of nature and the intellectual talent to unravel them. Purdue hired him as a physics professor, but almost immediately he began working in biology, taking the 'bacteriophage course' at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, followed by a two-year postdoc with Max Delbr\u00fcck at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech). Benzer's style was to pioneer a new area, and then to move on to something new once the hordes had rushed in. As he said: \u201cI like to take things that are fuzzy, and turn them into something tangible.\u201d Benzer next took a series of sabbaticals, wandering the world of phage genetics to sojourn with Fran\u00e7ois Jacob in Paris and Francis Crick in Cambridge, UK. It was during this period that he made some of his most important contributions to what is now viewed as the golden era of molecular genetics \u2014 the period following the publication of James Watson and Crick's double-helical structure of DNA that witnessed a feverish race to understand the mechanisms underlying the molecular basis of heredity. Using bacteriophage T4, Benzer developed a technique to select for rare genetic-recombination events in organisms carrying different mutations in the  rII  locus, and showed that mutations can occur at many different sites in the same gene. By generating a fine-structure genetic map, he proved that genes are not indivisible units, but are composed of a linear array of chemical building-blocks, or bases, each of which can be subject to alteration. Moreover, by a simple argument, he deduced that the minimum unit of mutation is probably a single base pair of DNA. This idea was fundamental to connecting the structure of DNA to the reality of genetics. And, together with Fred Sanger's discovery that proteins are composed of precise sequences of amino acids, this work laid the foundations of the new science of molecular biology. Most scientists would have been content to continue in this exciting field, but Benzer became characteristically restless. For him, once it became obvious how a problem could be solved, it was time to move on to another. This time, he was attracted to a far more formidable question: how genes influence behaviour. Traditional approaches to this problem had included studying how complex behavioural traits could be enhanced by selective breeding or altered by intercrossing. But Benzer had a different approach in mind: he would look for a model organism in which it would be possible to define single-gene mutations that altered specific behaviours. This strategy was clearly linked to his previous work on bacteriophage, and it established what he called genetic dissection as a valid method for analysing complex biological processes. In search of such an organism, Benzer took a sabbatical with Roger Sperry at Caltech, where he tinkered with various animal models. Eventually, he chose the fruitfly  Drosophila , and although his colleagues in the Sperry lab were not convinced, Benzer was undeterred. He once said: \u201cIf everyone you talk to says you shouldn't do something, you probably shouldn't do it, and if everyone says you should do something, you should also probably not do it; but if half the people you talk to tell you to do it and half say you're crazy, then you should definitely go ahead.\u201d Benzer turned his sabbatical at Caltech into an indefinite stay and never touched a phage again. He founded the modern field of  Drosophila  neurogenetics and explored this area in his peripatetic style from 1967 until his death. His work showed not only that it is possible to dissect behaviour with single-gene mutations, but also that fruitflies are capable of far more sophisticated behaviour than had previously been thought possible. They could learn, they had a sense of time, and they showed complex, stereotyped courtship rituals. To quantify these behaviours, Benzer built simple but ingenious devices, such as his counter-current apparatus for measuring phototaxis (an organism's movement in response to light). Using such tools, Benzer screened large numbers of flies to discover rare mutants with specific behavioural defects. This work, among his other achievements, laid the foundations for cloning genes controlling circadian rhythms and encoding potassium channels \u2014 crucial regulators of neuronal excitability\u2014 that had resisted all efforts at identification. Throughout, Benzer retained his arch and often ribald sense of humour, for example naming his learning and light-avoiding mutants dunce and photophobe, respectively. Almost 40 years later, hundreds of scientists continue in this experimental tradition, and entire meetings are devoted to neurogenetics. In later years, Benzer turned his attention to the genetic control of ageing, discovering mutations that cause degeneration of the brain (Swiss cheese) or extended lifespan (Methuselah) in  Drosophila , and opening the way to using the fruitfly as a model system in which to study neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's or Parkinson's. Benzer remained active until his last days. A food-lover, he led expeditions to exotic ethnic restaurants, and into his eighties participated in matzoh-ball or potato-latke cook-offs with his friends. Watching him trundle tirelessly down the corridor of his laboratory draped in a smudged lab coat, pockets heavy with tools and packets of notes scrawled in his near-illegible, crabbed handwriting; holding court with his lab members around a small steel table in his cramped conference room, while sipping hot tea and munching Fig Newtons; and asking rare but razor-sharp questions well into his mid-eighties, it was difficult to escape the conclusion that Benzer had discovered some magical elixir of youth in Drosophila and was experimenting with it on himself \u2014 but not telling. Benzer was an original, a scientist's scientist, and his death in many ways marks the end of an era.\u00a0 David Anderson (with additional contributions by Sydney Brenner) Reprints and Permissions"},

Gibbs"}], "parsed_as_year": "2006_or_before", "body": "A new variation on an old theme in atomic physics, a spectral distortion known as the Fano effect, has been revealed \u2014 not in an atom, but in an artificial nanostructure known as a quantum dot. The Fano effect is a quantum-mechanical interference phenomenon characterized by an asymmetrical broadening of spectral lines that pops up all over the place when certain materials absorb light. In 1981, it was predicted 1  that using light from a strong resonant laser beam would completely alter the spectrum of the Fano effect. That prediction has still not been fulfilled; but on  page 311  of this issue, Kroner  et al . 2  describe how using a resonant laser beam reveals a Fano effect that had hitherto remained obscured. Rather than using atoms, as has generally been the case in investigations of the Fano effect, the authors' demonstration uses single quantum dots. These nanoscale semiconducting structures are being used not only to study the fundamental interactions between photons and systems of energy levels similar to those in atoms, but also for constructing minuscule light-emitting diodes and lasers. Kroner and colleagues' Fano effect could have practical implications because it represents a sensitive way to detect the coupling of a transition between two energy levels to a continuum of energy states. Such couplings are usually undesirable for applications using quantum dots. Kroner and colleagues' quantum dots are made of the semiconductor indium arsenide (InAs) capped with a thin layer of gallium arsenide (GaAs). When light is shone on one of these quantum dots, the absorption of a photon excites an electron out of the semiconductor's valence band and into its conduction band. This excitation produces not only an electron, but also a hole, equivalent to a positive charge, where the electron used to be. Both the electron and the hole are tightly confined in three dimensions within the dot. Their energies are thus quantized into a set of discrete levels, just as in an atom. By adjusting the thickness of the GaAs capping layer and applying an electric field, the authors also created an effective quantum well, which contains a two-dimensional continuum of energy states for holes at energies overlapping the discrete energy of the hole, but spatially separated by a thin barrier. A hole, generated along with an electron by absorption of an incident photon, can tunnel into this well. By measuring the absorption spectrum of an individual quantum dot, Kroner  et al . looked for Fano interference between these two ways of absorbing a photon: the usual transition producing an electron and a hole in discrete energy levels, and the much weaker discrete\u2013continuum transition through the quantum tunnel. With a very weak laser beam, the authors saw no hint of the weak tunnel coupling. But as they increased the laser power, the discrete\u2013discrete absorption decreased towards the level of the discrete\u2013continuum transition 2 . Interference between these two pathways when they are of almost equal strength causes the absorption spectrum to take on the asymmetrical shape characteristic of a strong Fano effect. The credibility of this interpretation is strengthened by the fact that the asymmetry in the spectrum disappears if the continuum state is removed by making the capping layer thinner. So what? The important point to bear in mind is that the complete isolation of discrete\u2013discrete transitions in quantum dots is essential for almost all fundamental experiments on single quantum dots. This isolation could be spoiled by a small coupling to an unknown continuum. By driving the discrete\u2013discrete transition with a continuous-wave laser, a relatively weak leak to an unwanted continuum can be detected through the clear signal of Fano distortion. The effect will thus be a useful diagnostic tool in designing quantum-dot structures to eliminate such effects. This research is the latest in a long progression ever since it was first proposed in 1970 3  that man-made quantum structures could be designed that would mimic the quantized energy levels of an atom's potential well. The experimental breakthrough came with the development of the technique known as molecular-beam epitaxy, which allows single layers of semiconductor materials to be grown one on top of each other. Quantized energy levels were soon observed 4  in quantum energy wells produced by growing GaAs between potential barriers consisting of the closely related semiconductor aluminium gallium arsenide (AlGaAs). A few years later, Alexei Ekimov hypothesized that the losses in optical fibres that were then preventing their use for telecommunications were the result of semiconductor impurities. He introduced controlled amounts of semiconductor compounds into glass to test that theory. Ekimov noticed bumps in the absorption spectra of the glass that became more widely separated in energy as the volumes of the semiconductor regions were reduced. By analogy with the quantum-well phenomenon, he concluded 5  that this was a signature of three-dimensional quantum confinement 6 . The quantum dot had arrived. Quantum dots in glass and in colloidal solutions are useful for some applications. But it was obvious that the ability to grow dots within the easily doped heterostructures that dominate the world of semiconductor light-emitters would be highly desirable. This would enable the production of quantum-dot lasers that would require a reduced threshold current and maintain greater wavelength stability against temperature changes. The development 7  of self-organization techniques that use mechanical strain to trick the usual planar growth of molecular-beam epitaxy into becoming three-dimensional has permitted the control of quantum-dot density, diameter and height. High dot densities are ideal for lasers of very small volume. Low dot densities allow the isolation of a single quantum dot, providing sources of single photons on demand and quantum entangled states for quantum information science 8 . In all this, it is curious and instructive to note the mutual benefits of basic and applied research. An applied goal, reducing losses in optical fibres, led to the fundamental discovery of quantum dots; the applied goal of growing quantum dots for lasers resulted in dots that now compete with atoms for use in basic research. A quantum dot has the distinct advantage over an atom of being nailed to one place, and not needing multiple highly stabilized laser beams to trap it; the dot structure is also monolithic, tiny and long-lived. Indeed, quantum dots have arguably already become more useful than atoms in a number of instances, such as an efficient source of single photons on demand 9 . Kroner and colleagues' use 2  of the nonlinear Fano effect as, in essence, a tremendous sensitivity amplifier for the spectroscopic identification of weak continuum spectra adds another instance to the growing list.

But it is a very real proposition, and could be used to illuminate some profound aspects of wave\u2013particle duality. The law of wave diffraction is a tough nut to crack. Consider, for example, a beam from a simple laser pointer. It might still seem narrow and pencil-like when you shine it on a wall or screen a few metres from you, but if you were to point it at the Moon, it would have a diameter of several hundred kilometres. But there are ways to beat the system, and one of them is investigated by Siviloglou  et al . 1 , writing in  Physical Review Letters . They have generated objects known as Airy wave packets that are entirely resistant to spreading or diffraction. To appreciate the context of this advance, we must go back more than 100 years, to the time when it was becoming ever more apparent that classical mechanics and classical optics had significant shortcomings. Isaac Newton had originally proposed the idea that light came in discrete packets, which he called 'corpuscles'. But the wave-like behaviour of many optical phenomena swayed scientists towards the wave description of light. With the advent of quantum mechanics, however, came the notion of wave\u2013particle duality, which pops up in many different guises in physics. In this context, the concept of a wave packet takes on a pivotal, unifying significance. The wave packet is an 'envelope' containing an arbitrary number of waveforms, and also describes the probability that the particle or particles in a certain state will be measured to have a particular position and momentum. Owing to dispersion \u2014 waves of different frequencies travelling at different speeds \u2014 this wave packet should not remain unaltered. More generally, a given wave packet would then spread or diffract as it moves, changing its shape. In quantum mechanics, the wave packet is the mathematical solution to the Schr\u00f6dinger equation, which describes how a system evolves in time. The elegance of the physics is illustrated in the similarity between the mathematical form of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation (for particles) and the equation describing the diffraction of light. Light offers a very powerful way to explore such wave packets and their evolution, and to make telling analogies to the wave-like behaviour of matter. The non-diffracting Airy wave packets generated by Siviloglou  et al . 1  were predicted by Michael Berry and Nandor Balazs almost 30 years ago 2 . They are named after the nineteenth-century British astronomer George Biddell Airy, whose Airy function describes mathematically the way in which a star \u2014 an 'ideal' point source of light \u2014 is seen in a telescope. Owing to light's wave nature and the telescope's limited aperture, the ideal point image becomes a series of concentric ripples of bright and dark regions. In another demonstration of the underlying connections between matter and light, the Airy function is also the solution to Schr\u00f6dinger's equation for a particle confined in a triangular-shaped potential well. Siviloglou and colleagues 1  shone a beam of visible light on a device known as a spatial light modulator. This is an array of liquid-crystal droplets that can present a varying path length to the wavefront of the incident light. Its effect is to mould the wavefront to a desired shape or function. The authors programmed it to produce an Airy function ( Fig. 1 ) and looked at the beam's propagation characteristics. They confirmed that, as had been predicted 2 , the intensity profile of a beam of this shape remained unchanged ('propagation invariant') as the beam moved through free space. They also verified other intriguing aspects of these beams, such as the ability of local intensity maxima in the Airy beam to be coaxed to perform ballistic dynamics, rather like a cannonball, and to follow a parabolic trajectory. Features within the beams were seen to 'accelerate' by starting to move transverse to their direction of propagation. This behaviour may mimic that of a quantum-mechanical particle placed in a constant gravitational field 3 . It would be interesting to see if one could generate such wave packets with matter waves, perhaps in a 'quantum degenerate gas' in which most atoms have settled into a ground state, creating a coherent matter wave. In the absence of spreading or diffraction in light or matter, exciting applications become possible. Other light modes, such as Bessel beams 4 , have shown similar intriguing diffraction-free properties. These beams are now used to exert forces on minuscule particles (such as biological cells) in microfluidic environments, and to achieve targeted drug delivery into cells using ultrashort bursts of non-diffracting light 5 , with no precise focusing required. Stopping the spread of light or matter is a theorist's dream, but one with eminently practical consequences. Reprints and Permissions"},

The mysterious factor that tethers HIV-1 is probably a cell-membrane protein. Mammals have evolved various mechanisms to thwart the spread of intracellular pathogens. Thus, even if the infectious agent breaches the first lines of defence, the infected cells express restriction factors that suppress its further dissemination. One such restriction factor prevents HIV-1 from leaving infected cells and is counteracted by an accessory viral protein called Vpu. On  page 425  of this issue, Neil and colleagues 1  characterize this factor and provide tantalizing clues about how it functions Footnote  1 . To escape the infected cell, HIV-1 buds through the cell surface (thus becoming wrapped in an envelope derived from the host cell membrane) ( Fig. 1a ) and pinches off. But even if the virus reaches this stage of release, Vpu-deficient HIV-1 particles tend to remain trapped at the cell surface. What keeps them there has been a mystery. The effect of Vpu on virus release has been perplexing, as it seems to be unrelated to the protein's other function of reducing cellular levels of CD4, the HIV-1 receptor on T cells of the immune system. Also, Vpu's effect on release does not seem to require other HIV-1 components, and its importance for virus release varies widely among cell lines. It has emerged 2 , 3  that Vpu counteracts a human antiviral factor that suppresses HIV-1 release by tethering mature viral particles to the cell surface after they have completely pinched off. Such retention of HIV-1 particles at the surface of infected cells can also be induced by human interferon-\u03b1, a protein that 'jump-starts' a cell's antiviral defences 4 . Moreover, in an earlier study 5 , Neil and colleagues found that Vpu counteracts the effect of interferon-\u03b1 on HIV-1 release. The authors now identify 1  an interferon-\u03b1-induced human protein that fulfils all the criteria for the tethering factor antagonized by Vpu. The protein, which they aptly name tetherin, is expressed only by cells that require Vpu for HIV-1 release. Decreasing tetherin levels in cells that normally produce this protein allows the release of Vpu-deficient viruses. Furthermore, tetherin expression in cells that normally lack this protein selectively inhibits the release of Vpu-deficient HIV-1. Neil and colleagues' findings suggest that tetherin is highly potent, with only minute quantities being enough to efficiently inhibit HIV-1 lacking Vpu. How can tetherin entrap outgoing viral particles with such efficiency? Little is known about this small protein, but one aspect is clear \u2014 both ends of tetherin are inserted in the cell membrane through its unusual pair of membrane anchors 6 . The central portion of the protein faces the outside of the cell 6  and seems to interact with the same region of another tetherin molecule 7 . Thus, assuming that tetherin is incorporated into the membrane enveloping Vpu-deficient HIV-1 particles, Neil  et al . 1  envisage a situation in which tetherin molecules that end up in the viral envelope hold the virus back by interacting with tetherins that are associated with the cell surface ( Fig. 1b ). Tetherin also interacts with the cell's endocytotic \u2014 or internalization \u2014 machinery 8 , which might play a part in the reuptake of the trapped viruses into the cell and their degradation in intracellular compartments 3  ( Fig. 1c ). How does Vpu counteract the effects of tetherin? Neil  et al . 1  did not detect reduced tetherin levels in the presence of Vpu, although this could have been due to experimental overexpression of tetherin. A previous study 9 , however, found that levels of the protein now identified as tetherin are reduced by an entirely unrelated human virus, Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (a finding that also hints at the broad antiviral activity of this protein.) The viral protein responsible in this case, K5, is a ubiquitin ligase enzyme, which adds the molecular tag ubiquitin to proteins, marking them for degradation. K5 is structurally similar to a family of human ubiquitin ligases, at least one of which can strongly reduce the cellular levels of tetherin. With what turns out to be remarkable foresight, the authors of this earlier study 9  also tested Vpu and found that it, too, decreases the normal cellular levels of tetherin. These observations raise the possibility that Vpu uses a cellular ubiquitin ligase to dispose of tetherin, as it does for CD4. But other possibilities, such as tetherin relocalization by Vpu, rather than its degradation, are also possible. Only HIV-1 and a handful of its cousin viruses make Vpu, which poses the question of how other related viruses deal with tetherin. For HIV-2 (the less virulent human AIDS virus), a protein that mainly facilitates viral entry substitutes for Vpu, promoting virus release 10 , and we will probably soon learn whether this protein also antagonizes tetherin. Because the amino-acid sequence of tetherin differs considerably among mammals, some HIV-1-related animal viruses might find it difficult to overcome human tetherin, preventing them from becoming human viruses. Conversely, it is worth investigating whether tetherin contributes to the inability of HIV-1 to efficiently escape from most rodent cells 11 , which has hampered efforts to develop small-animal models of HIV-1 infection. Even in human cells, Vpu might not always be able to overcome the powerful effect of tetherin, as the release of infectious Vpu-positive HIV-1 can be inhibited with high doses of interferon-\u03b1 (ref.  5 ). Thus, an understanding of how tetherin works, and how Vpu fends it off, could lead to strategies to limit the spread of HIV-1 and other viruses that target humans. Reprints and Permissions"},

Alan Southward's many contributions set him among the most influential figures of twentieth-century marine science. Much of his career was spent at Plymouth, in Devon, an ideal location for studying how environmental changes affect marine ecosystems: the western English Channel and its approaches form a boundary between oceanic and coastal waters, as well as between two biogeographical provinces. In the 1890s, plankton surveys were started in this region by the Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom (MBA). Several time series were established, including those of zooplankton by Frederick Russell in the 1930s. Southward started baseline surveys of intertidal organisms around the British and Irish coasts in the 1950s, and later took over the Plymouth zooplankton time series. Using old records, he demonstrated how the distribution of organisms changed with changing sea temperatures. This was long before the advent of concern about global warming; his work laid the foundations for subsequent studies of climatic effects on marine ecosystems. Southward was born in Liverpool, the son of a Cunard engineering fitter. He contracted meningitis at 15, with the result that he lost his hearing and sense of balance, and had to learn to balance by eye. An interest in shore organisms led him to study zoology at the University of Liverpool, graduating in 1948. Doctoral studies followed, on the ecology of intertidal animals, at Port Erin Marine Laboratory on the Isle of Man. It was there that he met, and later married, his lifetime scientific partner, Eve Judges. In 1953, the year the MBA acquired the side-trawler  Sarsia  for offshore studies, Southward moved to Plymouth as a postdoctoral fellow. He was on the MBA staff from 1956 until his retirement in 1988, and continued working there until his death on 27 October 2007. He initially followed in the steps of Charles Darwin, the most famous student of barnacles, in showing how studies on barnacle distribution could allow inferences to be made about biogeographical barriers. His early intertidal surveys were used to quantify the damage caused by the detergent used to disperse the  Torrey Canyon  oil spill in 1967; more notably, he showed how long it took for the ecosystem to recover. From the early 1950s onwards, Southward showed how minor changes in environmental conditions, especially temperature, correlated with changing geographical ranges of intertidal and planktonic organisms. He worked with Russell, and others, describing the events leading to the 1930s collapse of the herring fishery and the replacement of herring by pilchards. Their seminal paper, published in 1971, linked changes in water mass and water chemistry to changes in plankton species and abundance. Subsequent studies on cyclical and long-term changes in the marine ecosystem led to an understanding of the causes of these changes, and to predictions of the consequences of rising sea temperatures. The Southwards first used  Sarsia  for deep-sea studies in 1956, dredging the continental slope for barnacles, which involved long hours of noisy winch work. The scientists' cabins were directly under the winch, making sleep difficult \u2014 except for Southward, whose deafness proved a boon (likewise his immunity to seasickness, although he was, once, reported to have felt uncomfortable in a force 12). Looking through dredge sievings, the Southwards noticed hair-like organisms that had probably been ignored previously because they resembled the fibres of the dredge nets. They became fascinated by these small, mouthless, gutless tubeworms, known as pogonophores, and investigated whether they could obtain nutrition from dissolved organic compounds in the sediment. Following the 1977 discovery of hydrothermal vents and giant pogonophores (vestimentifera) on the Galapagos Rift, Colleen Cavanaugh showed that sulphur-oxidizing bacteria living symbiotically within the vestimentiferans supplied them with their nutrition by chemosynthesis. It soon emerged that the small pogonophores of the continental slope also contained such bacteria. Several cruises to the slope were spent looking for the bacterial energy source because, unlike the vents, hydrogen sulphide and methane were almost absent there. Finally, Southward negotiated funding to study a shallow pogonophore habitat near Bergen, Norway. Two bivalve species were found, also with chemosynthetic bacteria, living alongside the pogonophores. Eventually, it was deduced that all these organisms 'mined' sedimentary iron sulphides to obtain energy for bacterial carbon dioxide fixation. In this way, chemosynthetic ecosystems were shown to be widespread in reducing sediments, from the intertidal regions to the deep sea. Southward continued studying pogonophores throughout his life, a final paper being completed just before his death. Research came full circle with the conclusion that many pogonophores are 'mixotrophic', depending on both endosymbiotic bacteria and dissolved organic matter. In retirement, Southward turned to the study of hydrothermal-vent ecosystems. This was aided by an invitation to become an adjunct professor at the University of Victoria, Canada, to study vents in the Pacific. He was an early user of stable-isotope data to follow nutritional pathways in such ecosystems in the Atlantic, Mediterranean and the Pacific. Southward was an excellent writer and stimulating speaker. For 20 years he was a meticulous editor of  Advances in Marine Biology , with an uncanny eye even for the missing comma in a reference list. He encouraged scientists from the Soviet Union to publish reviews in English to gain a wider audience. This led to a heavy editing workload, not least in coping with the authors' 'Russish', but Southward justifiably obtained great satisfaction from seeing their work in print. Following the break-up of the Soviet Union, there was little funding for Russian marine biologists, and Southward worked hard to find Western sources of money to keep them in post. Alan Southward was an innovative, multi-disciplinary scientist, one measure of his encyclopaedic knowledge being the impression he left on postgraduates at Victoria by his ability to advise them on any research project. He published prolifically, with 11 papers stemming from his doctoral studies alone; overall, he published 200 papers, along with two books ( Life on the Seashore  and  British Barnacles ). He could be impatient, especially with administrators who took a short-term view, but devoted much time to encouraging young scientists. Southward was one of the greatest marine biologists of his generation, and leaves an internationally regarded legacy of dedication and achievement. Reprints and Permissions"},

But it is in principle wholly realizable, and could open up new vistas \u2014 literally. Imagine walking down a footpath, staring unconcernedly at the clear track in front of you. Suddenly, you stumble over an object. You look down, but there is nothing to be seen on the ground. You step back and try a different angle of view, again without success. But you know something must be there, because you can feel it. This situation is brought a step closer to reality with a device dreamt up by Greenleaf  et al . 1  and described in  Physical Review Letters . The authors propose a way of creating an 'invisible tunnel' through which photons, the elementary particles of light, can propagate between two seemingly unconnected points. To an observer standing where they emerge from their tunnel, the photons seem to come from nowhere. To an external viewer, they seem to be teleported from one place to the other. And anything within the tunnel cannot be seen by anyone. In analogy to the infamous 'wormholes' \u2014 a prediction in general relativity of tunnels through space-time that connect distant areas of the Universe \u2014 the authors call their brainchild an electromagnetic wormhole. The wormhole works (in theory) by neatly combining concepts from differential geometry, general relativity, electromagnetism and the theory of 'metamaterials' 2 . Metamaterials are composite, nanostructured materials with specifically tuned electromagnetic properties. The authors construct the tunnel wall of their wormhole using a metamaterial layer that is designed to bend light waves around it without reflection, much as water waves bend around a tree branch or similar obstruction lying just below the surface of the water. This layer thus renders whatever is inside it invisible. The idea draws on techniques proposed 3 , 4  for the creation of an 'invisibility cloak' ( Fig. 1a ) \u2014 a device that has already been constructed and proved viable, at both microwave 5  and optical 6  wavelengths. The advance in Greenleaf and colleagues' scheme 1  is that a cloaked object can 'see' into the outside world at the end of the tunnel, because photons are also free to propagate through it. The tunnel 'deceives' photons into thinking that remote regions are connected to each other so that they naturally follow the path inside the cylindrical channel. This cylinder is not part of conventional three-dimensional space, but is part of a higher-dimensional space outside it. Its topology is rather like the handle of a coffee cup connecting two areas of the cup's surface. If the handle is hollow and has two open ends, it presents an alternative route (other than staying on the surface of the cup) for getting from the one place to the other. The key to the realization of this scheme is that this new photon-space does not naturally exist in real space. Rather, using suitable coordinate transformations, the authors tweak Maxwell's equations \u2014 the set of equations that describe the workings of electromagnetic waves \u2014 to simulate it. The equations retain their form on passing from the real to an artificial photon-space; the only thing that is required to complete the deception of the photons is to modify the values of the electric permittivity and magnetic permeability (numbers that codify the degree to which a material allows electric and magnetic fields to pass). Such a concealed communication channel could be deployed for military purposes for the secret transmission of information or stealth technologies. But it might also find its way into civilian applications: rerouting mobile-phone signals around obstacles, for example, or shielding sensitive medical devices from interference by magnetic resonance imaging scanners. But the possibilities don't end there. Two of Greenleaf and colleagues' invisible electromagnetic tunnels, built into the frame of a pair of special half-moon spectacles, would effectively 'glue' the photon-space behind the head to the photon-space in front of the eyes, allowing one literally to watch one's back ( Fig. 1b ). Currently, metamaterial technology allows the construction of invisibility cloaks that work well for only a limited range of frequencies. The electromagnetic wormhole in its present form can also be only short, otherwise the image of an object being transmitted through it becomes noticeably distorted. The true potential of such schemes will become clear in future experimental tests. What is plain now is that innovations are coming thick and fast in this burgeoning world of 'transformation optics'.

By observing how storms erupt in these jet streams and disturb them, we can penetrate deeper into what lies beneath. Just as physicians use outward signs to diagnose the conditions inside their patients, so planetary scientists get beneath the skin of their equally dynamic subjects by looking at their surface appearances. Penetrating deep into Jupiter, the Solar System's largest planet, is especially difficult, as a thick cloud-deck keeps the lower levels of the atmosphere hidden from telescopic observations. Thus, S\u00e1nchez-Lavega  et al . ( page 437  of this issue) 1  study the behaviour of giant storms at Jupiter's visible surface to reveal the vertical wind and temperature structure in the atmosphere beneath. The vivid stripes of Jupiter make the planet one of the most visually appealing objects in our Solar System. Observations by NASA's two Voyager spacecraft, which flew past in 1979, revealed that these bands of cloud are associated with atmospheric jet streams 2 . These jet streams are remarkably stable compared with their counterparts on Earth, which continually change course and vary in speed. Jupiter's jet streams, by contrast, flow essentially along lines of constant latitude. Measurements made by the Cassini probe 3 , passing in 2000 on its way to Saturn, show no change in the jets' large-scale structure since the Voyager observations, and only minor differences in their locations and peak speeds. Below this thick deck of cloud, however, observational records become scarce. The only direct measurements so far were made by the Galileo mission's entry probe 4 , 5  in 1995. This probe was designed to reach 140 kilometres below the clouds, but in fact entered a small, anomalously cloud-free region. Applying the information gleaned from this single  in situ  measurement to the rest of the planet is therefore not straightforward. As part of a campaign of observations to coincide with the passing of NASA's Pluto mission New Horizons, which swung by Jupiter in early 2007, S\u00e1nchez-Lavega  et al . 1  used the Hubble Space Telescope to monitor the Jupiter system. By chance, in late March 2007 they captured the onset of two large convective storms in a jovian jet stream at a latitude of 23\u00b0 N. This jet stream is particularly notable because it is Jupiter's fastest, with a speed that has varied between 140 and 180 metres per second in recent years 6 , 7 , 8 . The authors monitored the development of the storms using various ground-based telescopes as well as Hubble. The motion of the clouds during the outbursts gives useful hints about the atmospheric structures that lie beneath. In analysing their images, the authors found that the convective plumes substantially overshot the tropopause, a horizontal boundary in the atmosphere located above most clouds that generally acts as a stable dynamical lid on weather phenomena. The storm plumes must be extremely energetic, as they seem to extend more than 100 kilometres vertically from the storm's base below the thick cloud-deck. Towers of cumulus cloud on Earth extend up to only about 10 kilometres or so in the vertical. To explore this observation further, S\u00e1nchez-Lavega  et al . 1  performed numerical simulations with various background thermal stratifications. They show that, for a storm to become as energetic as those observed, the temperatures below the tropopause must be 2\u20135 kelvin colder than those measured by the Cassini probe on its 2000 fly-by 9 . It is as yet unclear whether this difference represents a local spatial variance or a change in the vertical temperature structure throughout the latitude band over time. But constraining the thermodynamic conditions that allow episodic stormy outbursts is in itself a significant advance. The authors' analysis also shows that the jet at 23\u00b0 N remained robust throughout the storm disturbances. Using another numerical model, S\u00e1nchez-Lavega  et al . tested various shapes of vertical shear below the clouds to reproduce the observed jet behaviour, and concluded that the jet stream's speed must increase with depth. This conclusion reaffirms an earlier result 10  reached following studies of a very similar disturbance in 1990. The disturbance in the 23\u00b0 N jet marked the climax of a global upheaval on Jupiter, with changes in the colours of the visible clouds in several different latitude bands being seen throughout the 2007 observation season. This turmoil followed a very similar pattern to events in 1975 and 1990 (ref.  11 ). It is tempting to draw an analogy to a beating pulse \u2014 albeit an irregular one, and of unknown origin. It will be interesting to see whether a similar phenomenon returns sometime after 2020, following another break of a similar length. Saturn, too, has recurring giant convective outbursts 12 ; both Jupiter and Saturn radiate more heat to space than they receive from the Sun, with cumulus convection transporting a great deal of heat vertically in their tropospheres. The pulsing nature of the giant storms on Jupiter and Saturn might even help us to understand how the heat flows from the deep interior to the surface on these planets. A remarkable aspect of S\u00e1nchez-Lavega and colleagues' report 1  is the increasing part now being played by amateur astronomers in planetary observation campaigns. The almost continuous observational coverage by amateurs around the globe allowed the growth and motion of individual large-scale storm clouds to be followed for up to 45 days, while the Hubble telescope performed occasional tracking of fine-scale features for about 10 hours at a time. In recent years, inexpensive digital cameras and access to sophisticated image-processing techniques that correct for the blurring caused by Earth's atmosphere have enabled advanced amateurs with modest-sized telescopes to image planets with resolutions high enough to resolve many atmospheric phenomena ( Fig. 1 ). This coverage from around the world nicely complements the more powerful, but less flexible capabilities of the large ground- and space-based telescopes. Undoubtedly, as the planetary physicians continue to probe deeper under the skin of their subjects, the dedicated amateur medic will be on hand to supply some of the diagnostic tools.

Judah Folkman often said \u201cScience goes where you imagine it.\u201d Few imagined more boldly or pushed science further than he did. As director of the Vascular Biology Program and a former surgeon-in-chief at the Children's Hospital Boston in Massachusetts, Folkman brought both a scientist's and a surgeon's perspectives to finding solutions to medical problems. His research observation that some tumours grow whereas others remain dormant, fused with his clinical experience in removing hot, bloody malignancies, produced a profound insight \u2014 that the recruitment of a dedicated blood supply, a process known as angiogenesis, is essential to tumour growth. Folkman's single-mindedness in demonstrating this principle redefined our understanding of cancer biology. Furthermore, it established angiogenesis as a fundamental biological process operating in health, embryonic development and many diseases besides cancer \u2014 macular degeneration, heart disease, diabetic retinopathy, endometriosis and obesity among them. Peter Carmeliet has predicted that treatments to stimulate or repress angiogenesis will eventually benefit half a billion people worldwide (P. Carmeliet  Nature   438 , 932\u2013936; 2005). Today, thousands of researchers around the world, many trained in Folkman's lab, are working to make this promise a reality. But when Folkman embarked on the scientific odyssey that would establish the field of angiogenesis, he sailed alone. Folkman was born in 1933, in Cleveland, Ohio, and was educated at Ohio State University and Harvard Medical School. He followed this with a surgical residency at Massachusetts General Hospital. His angiogenesis hypothesis had its roots in the late 1960s. On leave from his surgical residency to complete two years of military service at the National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland, he was developing blood substitutes and testing them by perfusing rabbit thyroid glands in the lab. Out of curiosity, he seeded the glands with mouse tumour cells. The tumours grew to about 1 millimetre, then stopped. Yet,  in vivo , the same cells formed large, lethal cancers. After completing his surgical training and establishing his lab at the Children's Hospital, Folkman pursued the puzzle of dormant versus active tumours. Watching thread-like capillaries grow straight towards dormant tumours, he concluded that the tumours secreted an angiogenesis stimulator. Because not all tumours become vascularized, however, he further proposed a corollary process of angiogenesis inhibition. Blocking angiogenesis, he argued, would provide a new approach to controlling certain cancers. Folkman published his ideas about angiogenesis in 1971 (J. Folkman  N. Engl. J. Med.   285,  1182\u20131186; 1971). This landmark paper initially met with scepticism. Undaunted, he and his small research group developed the cell-culture methods, bioassays and drug-delivery systems they needed to validate the theory. Notably, the technology for slow-release, drug-delivery polymers emerged from this work. It took a decade for Folkman's lab to isolate the first angiogenesis stimulator \u2014 basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) \u2014 and yet another for it to identify the inhibitors angiostatin and endostatin. These breakthroughs launched an era of discovery and validation, during which Folkman's group and others uncovered additional pro- and antiangiogenic factors, began mapping the molecular pathways of pathological angiogenesis, and started to develop antiangiogenic drugs. Today, more than 50 angiogenesis inhibitors are approved or in clinical trials around the globe. Although most target cancer, drugs to treat a condition called wet age-related macular degeneration have had the most stunning success so far, reversing blindness in many patients. Folkman never stopped pushing his own imagination or the bounds of scientific understanding. In 2004, he proposed that we may someday control cancer by \u201ctreating a biomarker\u201d with angiogenesis inhibitors (J. Folkman & R. Kalluri  Nature   427 , 787; 2004), just as we treat heart disease by prescribing statins in response to high cholesterol levels. Folkman foresaw biomarkers for the 'angiogenic switch', the point at which the balance of angiogenesis stimulators and inhibitors shifts in favour of stimulation, generating the web of blood vessels that turns cancer into a killer. The switch happens years before a tumour can be imaged or felt. Folkman speculated that if cancer were detected this early and treated with low-toxicity antiangiogenic drugs, it would remain dormant. Patients would have cancer but not disease. At the time of his sudden death on 14 January, Folkman had been testing this theory in patients at risk of recurrent cancer, using biomarkers for early angiogenesis developed in his Vascular Biology Program. He had also begun to view angiogenesis as an organizing principle of biology, essential for the growth of any mass from a cancerous tumour to an atherosclerotic plaque. He had proposed that angiogenesis biomarkers could potentially detect a range of blood-vessel-dependent diseases, and that one day a single, broad-spectrum angiogenesis inhibitor or a combination of antiangiogenic drugs might be used to treat them all. This was another bold theory, one left for others to pursue. Folkman's contributions to vision and cardiovascular research, as well as to cancer biology, were widely recognized. Apart from being elected to the National Academy of Sciences and Institute of Medicine, and appointed to the President's Cancer Advisory Board, he received more than 150 awards and prizes, including scientific honours from 11 nations. But neither the awards nor accounts of his scientific accomplishments capture what those who knew him valued most in Folkman \u2014 his humanity and generosity. He was legendary for sharing unpublished data, and masterly at balancing guidance and creative freedom to nurture young investigators' careers. Nowhere was Folkman's compassion and generosity more evident, however, than with patients. He would leave the office late in the evening, a briefcase slung over each shoulder, a notebook of to-do's in his breast pocket, wheeling his laptop behind him. After dinner with his wife of 47 years, Paula, he would retire to his study, take out the notebook, and begin calling patients who had left messages that day. Most were people he had never met, desperate for hope and advice. He called them all. Folkman never used his first name, Moses, but he shared much in common with his Biblical namesake. He was a teacher, leader and iconoclast. Although he did not live to see the full promise of antiangiogenic therapy realized, he trained and inspired many who will carry forward his dream.

Zaworotko"}], "parsed_as_year": "2006_or_before", "body": "Imagine being able to tweak the properties of a compound simply by replacing a molecular 'cartridge' with a different one. Just such a capability has been developed in a new class of porous crystalline materials. Porous materials are creating quite a stir among materials scientists because of their many possible uses, which range from gas storage to drug delivery. But before certain applications are possible, a simple way must be found of tweaking the properties of these molecular sponges. Reporting in the  Journal of the American Chemical Society , Kawano  et al . 1  describe just such a method. They have prepared a porous material consisting of two molecular components, one of which can be easily replaced, rather like changing the cartridge in a pen. This flexibility allows the absorption properties of the solid to be fine-tuned. Metal\u2013organic materials are porous compounds consisting of metals or metal clusters bound to organic molecules known as ligands. Research into these compounds has undergone two bursts of growth over the past couple of decades. The first occurred after the publication of a seminal paper 2  in 1990, which outlined the design opportunities these compounds present for controlling the arrangements of atoms in solids. The second burst occurred in the late 1990s, when it became clear that such compounds combine unprecedented levels of porosity with properties such as magnetism, catalysis, polarity and luminescence 3 , 4 , 5 . This makes them potentially useful for many applications, including for gas storage and separation, as chemical and biological sensors, and even for harvesting energy from light. Metal\u2013organic materials now deservedly lie at the forefront of advanced materials, offering a synergistic suite of features that gives them several advantages over other porous compounds. Their first useful property is ease of design. Most crystal structures are unpredictable, but those of metal\u2013organic materials are controllable. They also have structural blueprints similar to those found in nature. For example, they can exist as 'zero-dimensional' nanostructures based on atomic polyhedra, rather like those found in viruses or the carbon molecule buckminsterfullerene. Other metal\u2013organic materials adopt two- and three-dimensional atomic frameworks that have topologies comparable to those of minerals 6 , 7 . One such topology, known as the cubic net, inspired the Dutch artist M. C. Escher ( Fig. 1a ). Aesthetic qualities aside, the cubic net is a good example of the framework of a metal\u2013organic material \u2014 a modular structure in which the dimensions of the pores are controlled by the size of its molecular building-blocks 6 . The second desirable aspect of these materials is that a given topology can be constructed from very different molecular building-blocks \u2014 anything from simple metal ions to complex organic molecules. This means that a desired structural framework can be reproduced at different scales, and with diverse chemical or physical properties. For example, the cubic net can be constructed at an atomic scale from octahedral complexes of metal ions 3 , or at 10 to 30 times atomic scale from pseudo-octahedral nanostructures 8 . Furthermore, because these materials often self-assemble from existing molecular building-blocks, they can frequently be prepared in simple, single-step procedures. Finally, the general properties of metal\u2013organic materials set them apart from other porous materials: they are readily characterized, crystalline compounds with well-defined compositions and an unprecedented range of surface areas (as a result of their controllable pore and cavity sizes). Combined with the diverse range of specific properties that can be obtained by varying the molecular building-blocks, these compounds provide a platform of materials that can be adapted for many applications. An exciting strategy for fine-tuning the properties of metal\u2013organic materials would be to incorporate sites for molecular recognition into their pores, so creating systems that mimic molecular binding in nature. This general concept has also been illustrated by Escher ( Fig. 1b ). But building molecular recognition into these compounds requires chemical modification of their walls and cavities, to introduce groups that can bind to target molecules (by hydrogen bonding for example). This has, in fact, already been accomplished in a limited fashion using two approaches: pre-synthetic modification, in which chemical groups are incorporated into a molecular building-block before the metal\u2013organic material is synthesized 9 , and post-synthetic modification, in which chemical reactions take place in the pre-assembled compound 10 , 11 . But these are not generally applicable strategies, because pre-synthetic modification of the molecular building-blocks can interfere with the reactions needed to form a metal\u2013organic material, whereas post-synthetic modification often requires harsh reaction conditions that might damage the compound. Kawano  et al . 1  describe an innovative solution to this problem \u2014 they use interchangeable molecular 'cartridges' to modify the internal surfaces of the compounds. The authors prepared a porous system in which an organic ligand donates electrons to zinc iodide, forming so-called coordination bonds. The resulting network traps aromatic molecules (known as triphenylenes) via non-covalent interactions. This results in a three-dimensional compound held together by a synergistic combination of coordination bonds and non-covalent bonds, and which contains two types of nanopore ( Fig. 2 ). The triphenylenes can be thought of as molecular cartridges, because they can be replaced during synthesis with other triphenylenes that have different chemical groups attached. Because these molecules form some of the walls of the pores, the pores' molecular-recognition properties depend on which cartridge is present. More specifically, recognition depends on the chemical groups attached to the cartridges. So, for example, one of the triphenylenes used by the authors directs a phenol group \u2014 an OH group attached to a benzene ring \u2014 towards the interior of the pores; the resulting metal\u2013organic material selectively adsorbs alcohol molecules such as propan-2-ol. In effect, the authors have found a simple way of fine-tuning the hydrogen-bonding capabilities of their metal\u2013organic material. This breakthrough is not just of scientific interest, as such compounds are serious candidates for membrane materials that will separate alcohols from mixtures of liquids. This property could be useful in biofuel production, for example, or in highly selective chemical sensors. Kawano and colleagues' discovery realizes long-held aspirations of many physicists. Almost 50 years ago, Richard Feynman had this to say 12 : \u201cWhat would the properties of materials be if we could really arrange the atoms the way we want them? They would be very interesting to investigate theoretically. I can't see exactly what would happen, but I can hardly doubt that when we have some control of the arrangement of things on a small scale we will get an enormously greater range of possible properties that substances can have, and of different things that we can do.\u201d Feynman would undoubtedly have been thrilled at the possibilities opened up by the authors' molecular cartridges.
