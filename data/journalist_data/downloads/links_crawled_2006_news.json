An unprecedented repository of disease-related data is bringing together information about the genes, health and lifestyles of thousands of subjects studied over many years. The web-based portal will allow any interested investigator to search across multiple epidemiological studies, in the hope of identifying new links to disease. The 'database of Genotype and Phenotype' (dbGaP) is funded by the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) and was launched earlier this month. So far, it contains data from two big studies that aim to link information about genetic make-up (genotype), physical characteristics including health (phenotype) and lifestyle to particular diseases. These are the 600-subject Age-Related Eye Diseases Study and the 2,573-subject Parkinsonism Study. Starting next year, the repository will also contain data from the huge Framingham Heart Study, which has followed 14,000 subjects over three generations since 1948. These will be joined by information from the NIH's recently launched Genetic Association Information Network (GAIN), a public\u2013private partnership that genotypes samples from existing studies. Other US and international databases will follow. It is the first time that some of these big studies, such as the Framingham, have been available to interested parties. And researchers will now be able to mine the vast stores of genetic, phenotypic and study-protocol data simultaneously. \u201cThis is really going to change the scope and efficiency of access to the data,\u201d says Chris O'Donnell, associate director of the Framingham study. The repository is part of a larger push towards genome-wide association studies at the NIH. And similar efforts are under way elsewhere. For example, Britain's Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium began collecting genotype data for such studies in 2005. Rather than studying only a few genes or gene markers of interest, as researchers have done in the past, these studies try to link features in individuals suffering from certain diseases to variations in a genome-wide set of genetic markers. It is hoped that this will identify new associations, and the huge sample sizes in the NIH repository should give such studies more power than ever before. There are technical caveats. If gene variants for a particular disease are very uncommon, or a disease risk comes from hundreds of different genes, then links could still go undetected. Furthermore, data might not have been treated in the same way across different studies, and so may not be strictly comparable. \u201cControls for schizophrenia might not be as good for diabetes,\u201d notes GAIN investigator Pablo Gejman, director of the Center for Genetics in Psychiatry at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois. But it is hoped that investigators will gain major insights by looking across studies for genetic variants linked to, for example, blood pressure, which is often measured. The launch of the dbGaP comes as the NIH wrestles with how best to monitor and disseminate the unprecedented amount of clinical and biological data that studies are now producing. The agency is working on a policy that will govern all the genome-wide association studies that it funds. There is particular focus on addressing concerns over privacy. Some people worry about the consequences of, say, insurance companies or law-enforcement officials getting hold of the data. The dbGaP's regulations on data access mirror the proposed NIH-wide rules: although study documents, protocols and summary data will be freely available online, researchers will have to apply for access to individual genotype and phenotype results, and these data will lack any information that could identify the subjects. Also at issue is how much of a publishing advantage should be given to the researchers who may have devoted the best part of their careers to collecting the patient data. The proposed NIH policy calls for a nine-month period during which only the original study investigators can submit a paper for publication based on the data, although all researchers are free to analyse them immediately. In the case of the dbGaP, that period might vary according to the study. Framingham study investigators, for example, will have a 12-month window, according to O'Donnell. \n                     Opinion: A gene-centric approach to genome-wide association studies \n                   \n                     Evaluating coverage of genome-wide association studies \n                   \n                     Huge Biobank project launches despite critics \n                   \n                     Japan launches controversial Biobank project \n                   \n                     NIH's dbGaP database \n                   \n                     Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium \n                   \n                     Framingham Heart Study \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Two unexpected effects are plaguing a quixotic satellite designed to measure a subtle effect of gravity. But project scientists say they are optimistic that they can still extract a significant finding from their data. The problems have delayed results from the satellite, known as Gravity Probe-B, until spring 2007, according to project head Francis Everitt, a physicist at Stanford University in California. Gravity Probe-B is designed to detect a tiny effect of gravity known as frame dragging. According to Einstein's general theory of relativity, a spinning mass such as the Earth drags space-time around it like a mixer dragging batter. Gravity Probe-B hoped to detect the effect with four almost perfectly spherical gyroscopes attached to a telescope. The telescope is trained on a guide star, and the gyros are set spinning. With the satellite aligned to the star, the drag should tilt the gyros off their axes by a minuscule amount, around 0.000011 degrees in a year. Gravity Probe-B's journey from conception into orbit was unusually long. It began with modest funding from NASA in 1964, but the high-precision instruments it required took around two decades to develop. The 1986 Challenger disaster further set back the launch of the probe, which was originally scheduled to fly aboard a space shuttle (see  Nature   426 , 380; 2003). After several near-cancellations, the satellite finally lifted off in April 2004. By then it had racked up a price tag of US$700 million, and another project, Lageos, had become the first to measure the frame-dragging effect (see  Nature   431 , 958; 2004). After an initial calibration phase, Gravity Probe-B took a year's worth of data, completing operations in September 2005. Results were expected by last summer, but the announcement never came. Nature  has learned that this is because two unanticipated effects are clouding the team's frame-dragging result. The first is a slight, circular wobble created by a combination of tiny imperfections in the gyroscopes and a gradual slowing of their spinning. Gravity Probe-B scientists anticipated the wobble, but their calculations had ruled out the possibility that its period would change. \u201cBut it happened,\u201d says Everitt. \u201cNature decides what it wants to do.\u201d The second problem is a torque on the four gyros. The twisting force came about when the satellite's telescope occasionally slipped off the guide star, and it seems to be related to tiny electric fields between various components of the probe. The team didn't discover the effect until after the satellite finished taking data, but are now trying to disentangle it from the result. The problem appeared quite serious during the summer, but Everitt says the team is now working on a \u201cvery elegant\u201d solution. It is unclear how the problems will affect the mission's result. \u201cThe Gravity Probe-B team is playing its cards very close to its chest,\u201d says Bernard Schutz of the Max-Planck Institute for Gravitational Physics in Potsdam, Germany. \u201cNobody outside the project knows whether they can understand and measure the effects well enough to reach their original objective.\u201d That objective was to measure the frame-dragging effect to within about 1%, which would be ten times more accurate than the Lageos result. Clifford Will, a physicist at Washington University in St Louis, who chairs NASA's scientific advisory board for the project and has been briefed by the team, says he is optimistic that there will be some sort of result. \u201cBut will it be what they promised NASA? I don't know.\u201d Everitt says that his team will announce a definitive result at the American Physical Society meeting in April 2007. He says he is still worried about whether they can produce a meaningful finding: \u201cI don't think you should be relaxed on $700 million,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I wouldn't have agreed to give a talk if I wasn't reasonably confident.\u201d \n                     Gravity probe to test Einstein \n                   \n                     A confirmation of the general relativistic prediction of the Lense\u2013Thirring effect \n                   \n                     Space science: Unstoppable force \n                   \n                     Spinning Earth twists space \n                   \n                     Gravity Probe B \n                   \n                     Lageos \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

What if threatened species, instead of waiting for extinction, decided to charm humans into saving them? That's the plot of this winter's hit film,  Happy Feet , in which emperor penguins score a total moratorium on Antarctic fishing thanks to their winsome tap-dancing routines. Environmental groups are using the film, and last year's equally popular documentary  March of the Penguins , to push their messages \u2014 especially the dangers of increasing fishing in the Southern Ocean and climate change. Mark Stevens, a campaign manager at the National Environmental Trust, sees  Happy Feet  as a way to boost audiences' environmental awareness. \u201cIt's a fun, gentle way to educate people about it. Whenever we get a chance, we like to talk about the facts behind the movie.\u201d In  Happy Feet , the penguins' fish shortage is caused by humans. Stevens says that another source of food for some penguins is threatened in real life: \u201cFishing for krill is expected to increase dramatically in the next few years.\u201d During the height of  March of the Penguins ' popularity, lawyers at another environmental group, the Center for Biological Diversity based in Tucson, Arizona, decided to ask the Environmental Protection Agency to list a dozen penguin species as endangered. They timed the move to the release of  Happy Feet . \u201cWe scrambled to assemble and file the petition while the buzz around the movie was at its peak,\u201d says Brendan Cummings, an attorney with the group. But all this animated advocacy has some US commentators up in arms, criticizing  Happy Feet  as propaganda by stealth. Conservative-leaning Fox News anchor Neil Cavuto called it an \u201canimated  Inconvenient Truth \u201d, referring to former US vice-president Al Gore's documentary on climate change, even though the film doesn't mention global warming directly. Many children's films have had environmental themes in the past few years (see  'Messages in movies' ). Meanwhile the US Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources, although widely praised for setting sensible fishing quotas, is being pressured by various groups of environmentalists and scientists to consider more cautiously the whole Antarctic ecosystem, including penguins, when setting fishing restrictions in the Southern Ocean. One major effort is the Antarctic Krill Conservation Project, in which the National Environmental Trust and Pew Charitable Trusts are both involved. David Ainley, an ornithologist and adviser for ecological consultants H. T. Harvey & Associates, spoke to  Nature  via satellite phone from Ross Island in Antarctica, and understandably hasn't seen  Happy Feet  yet. He's less worried about krill than about Antarctic toothfish ( Dissostichus mawsoni)  further up the food chain, but adds that the combined effect of climate change and human intervention on the food web are complex and need more research. Even Ainley's perspective is likely to be more widely disseminated thanks to penguinmania. He's producing a film on climate change and Adelie penguins, which he hopes to distribute to schools. \u201cObviously,\u201d he says, \u201cwe're banking on penguins for the wide distribution of our educational DVD.\u201d \n                     Demise of the world's most famous iceberg \n                   \n                     Family values in black and white \n                   \n                     Grizzlies, dodos and Gore put science on film \n                   \n                     Climate change in focus \n                   \n                     Regional climate change special \n                   \n                     National Environmental Trust's Happy Feet tie-in page \n                   \n                     Antarctic Krill Conservation Project \n                   \n                     Center for Biological Diversity's Penguin Page \n                   \n                     Penguin Science \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

In the contentious world of animal research, one question surfaces time and again: how useful are animal experiments as a way to prepare for trials of medical treatments in humans? The issue is crucial, as public opinion is behind animal research only if it helps develop better drugs. Consequently, scientists defending animal experiments insist they are essential for safe clinical trials, whereas animal-rights activists vehemently maintain that they are useless. Now a British team has made the first attempt to answer the question in a scientific way, and the result suggests that animal researchers need to raise their game. The team claims that animal experiments are often poorly designed, and so fail to lay the ground properly for subsequent human studies. The study looked at six treatments that have been evaluated in detail in human trials. The researchers assessed whether animal studies had accurately predicted the outcome of the human work, a task that involved reviewing more than 200 papers. In three of the six cases, the answer was no (P. Perel  et al. Br. Med. J.  doi:10.1136/bmj.39048.407928.BE; 2006). Ian Roberts, an epidemiologist at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and one of the study's authors, says further analysis revealed that poor-quality methodologies and inappropriate models caused the failures. Some studies didn't randomize the allocation of animals to control and treatment groups properly, whereas others showed evidence for publication bias \u2014 the tendency not to publish negative results. A third set involved inappropriate models: for example in studies of head injury, treatments were administered just five minutes after rodents were deliberately injured, but humans are typically treated within three hours of accidents. Roberts would like to see animal researchers learn from clinical trials, where similar problems are now being addressed. He says animal researchers should register experiments before they begin, for example, to ensure the results are reported and to avoid publication bias. He would also like more detailed reporting of experimental procedures, so reviewers can ignore low-quality and potentially biased work. \u201cAll the things that happen in clinical trials need to happen in animal experiments,\u201d he says. Some scientists familiar with both animal and human studies have welcomed the paper, saying it highlights the need for researchers from the two arenas to work more closely on the design of animal experiments. But others have questioned whether a crude comparison of trials says anything meaningful about the usefulness of animal work. In many cases, say critics, animal studies are designed to address specific questions not related to a drug's effectiveness, such as how it distributes around the body, and so cannot be compared to clinical trials. Others point out that applying the standards used in human trials to animal experiments could be prohibitively expensive. For example, initial tests are often run by small groups of researchers. With just one or two scientists, it is impractical to properly blind a study. It is also worth remembering that researchers apply an \u201cintelligent filter\u201d to animal results when designing clinical trials, says Robert Lechler, an immunologist at Kings College London, and don't expect the results to map straight over to human work. Roberts counters that his paper looked only at animal studies that were specifically designed to model human disease. And he adds that despite the low cost, small-scale studies are pointless if they do not produce results that people can have confidence in, even if researchers are aware of the limitations. \u201cIf you have something cheap and cheerful you have a high probability that the result is wrong,\u201d he says. \u201cJust think of the money that is wasted down the line if you follow up that lead.\u201d The results are likely to feature in future campaigns by animal-rights groups as evidence that animal research doesn't benefit medicine. But the authors stress that this would be an error, and that a comparison of just six treatments cannot be used to justify general statements about animal research. \u201cIt's not a polemic against animal researchers,\u201d says Peter Sandercock, a neurologist at the University of Edinburgh and another author on the study. \u201cBut we need to be aware that there are biases in the animal trials.\u201d \n                     Primate research 'should have dedicated centres' \n                   \n                     Scientists share thoughts on animal research \n                   \n                     Animal research: A matter of life and death \n                   \n                     Animal research: Grey Matters \n                   \n                     Animal Research: Primates in the frame \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

When this photo was taken on 3 October, the rover Opportunity was sitting on the edge of the kilometre-wide crater, although it can't be seen at this scale. \n               Our Earth, ever more familiar \n             This is the quarter-of-a-millionth image from the International Space Station, taken on 15 August. The ever-increasing amount of information from space is changing the way we look at ourselves \u2014 and encouraging people to abandon the crumpled road maps in the their gloveboxes in favour of satellite navigation. \n               Eclipse 2006 \n             A total solar eclipse is not that rare. But it still seems miraculous that the Sun could ever disappear, and images of the event have a unique power. This one was taken on 29 March by Fred Espenak in Libya. \n               A face on Mars no more \n             On 21 September, the Mars Express satellite took this image of a cluster of mountains that in a famous 1976 Viking photo (inset) looked eerily like a face. Human beings' innate tendency to see patterns may be at the heart of many scientific discoveries, but we also have it to thank for seeing faces in out-of-focus mountains and crouching leopards in the backyard shrubbery. \n               The ozone hole is back \n             The ozone hole is breaking records again. It was as large this September as it has ever been, at 27.5 million square kilometres, thanks to cold Antarctic temperatures. Long term, the hole is still shrinking, but year-on-year variability can mask this gradual process. \n               A cathedral of detectors \n             This is a view down the gullet of the ATLAS experiment at CERN, the particle-physics lab near Geneva. Over the course of this year it has slowly been filled up with all manner of detectors, and work will continue until it's ready to go live sometime in November 2007. Its constructors hope that results from the detectors will allow them to infer the presence of such exotic particles as the Higgs boson. \n               The art in your engine \n             A vortex of flame swirls inside a combustion chamber. Researchers at the French National Aerospace Research Center (ONERA) caught this shot while examining combustion inside an engine in minute detail. The aim was to make such motors more efficient, but the team has also shown the beauty of their inner workings. \n               A butterfly on a butterfly \n             This butterfly, which appeared in November, is actually on a butterfly's wing. The insect was engineered so that its cells expressed a green fluorescent dye when a particular heat-sensitive protein was activated. A laser was then used to induce heat shock and etch out the pattern. \n               Anatomy of a smile \n             In October 2004, the  Mona Lisa  was transported from her home in the Louvre to the Centre for Research and Restoration of the Museums of France in Paris for its first thorough scientific examination. Published in September, this three-dimensional laser scan of the painting's surface shows the slight warping of the wood on which Leonardo painted 500 years ago. \n               Intricate sequence \n             Ditch the pipette and do your DNA sequencing at the nanolitre scale with this stylish 100-mm wafer, created by Robert Blazej and his colleagues at the University of California, Berkeley, and unveiled in May.

Quirin Schiermeier investigates whether carbon offsetting can really save the planet. The 2006 World Cup in Germany will be remembered for France's Zinedine Zidane head-butting Italy's Marco Materazzi in the final. But in another sense, the largest sports event ever has passed without a trace: it has supposedly left no mark on the planet's atmosphere. The international football association FIFA says it has met its 'Green Goal' to wipe out the World Cup's carbon footprint. It's estimated that the millions of fans who travelled to Germany to watch the matches generated around 100,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide. So local organizers collected \u20ac1.2 million (US$1.6 million) from sponsors and used it to buy credits worth that amount on the voluntary emission market. The money will be invested in renewable-energy projects in developing countries. Such voluntary carbon offsetting is becoming ever more fashionable: the 2012 Olympic Games in London will be labelled carbon neutral, and bands from Pink Floyd to Pearl Jam claim to rock carbon-free. British diplomats and government members jet around the world in a supposedly climate-friendly manner, as do many bankers and insurance brokers. Nicholas Stern, chief author of a recent report on the costs of climate change (see  Nature   444 , 6\u20137; 2006), is offsetting the CO 2  produced by his current promotional tour. Offsetting is also becoming more popular among households, air travellers and car owners. There are currently around 40 retailers in Europe, Australia and North America that offer to save emissions on customers' behalf. And many travel companies allow customers to fund environmental projects worldwide. It seems easy: for a small sum we can assuage our climate guilt \u2014 without changing our lifestyles. But does such offsetting really save the carbon emissions it promises? And can we really counter climate change by paying for carbon-saving projects elsewhere? The projects on offer vary hugely. The first problem is simply calculating the amount of carbon that needs to be offset. For example, the British Carbon Neutral Company calculates a return flight from London to Bangkok, Thailand, at 2.1 tonnes of CO 2  per passenger, which it charges around \u20ac30 to offset. Swiss-based myclimate arrives at 3.6 tonnes and \u20ac86 for the same flight, and the German Atmosfair reckons 6.9 tonnes and \u20ac139. The figures differ because the Carbon Neutral Company calculates only the extra CO 2  emitted per passenger on a given route. Other providers multiply that impact by a factor of 2\u20133. This is because aircraft emissions, including nitric oxide, nitrogen dioxide and planes' vapour trails, have a more complex effect on clouds, ozone and climate than do those from earthbound polluters. \n               Hot air? \n             And if it's difficult to measure an individual's carbon footprint, it's almost impossible for big companies and events to decide which activities to include and where to draw the line between necessary and avoidable emissions, says Martin Cames, an emissions-trading expert with the \u00d6ko-Institut in Berlin. This means that extra emissions are often underestimated. For example, the \u00d6ko-Institut worked out thecarbon footprint of the World Cup for FIFA, but simplified the calculation by counting only the extra flights caused by the event. Another issue is the choice of project. The cost of offsetting one tonne of CO 2  currently ranges from \u20ac3 to \u20ac30, and the projects on offer vary in type, scale and quality, from small fuel-switching projects to large-scale changes in land use and forest growth (see  'Setting off' ). Buyers, private or corporate, need to make sure that the emission cuts that they pay for would not otherwise occur. If, for example, a measure is already required by law, the 'additionality' of a project, compared with business as usual, is not guaranteed. Sascha Lafeld, of the Frankfurt-based company Climate Change Consulting (3C), says the key is to check that the projects on offer require the external funding. Also important is ensuring that offset projects are not counted more than once. This might happen if the same credit is sold to more than one buyer, or if voluntary reductions are counted against mandatory national targets. And even if a project looks good on paper, such deals are risky. Most are located in developing countries, which don't have emission targets set by the Kyoto Protocol. But credits are usually sold upfront, with a promise that the money will be put into future projects, so there is a significant risk that the projects could fail to deliver reductions, or to materialize at all. \n               Bull market \n             The market's main weakness is a lack of standards and verification procedures. But guidelines are available from the UK Carbon Trust and the Clean Air\u2013Cool Planet initiative in the United States. And the UK government's Environmental Audit Committee launched an inquiry last week into the issues surrounding voluntary offsetting. One key question is whether such schemes should require official accreditation. The most widely recognized certification so far, called the Gold Standard, is owned and supported by 42 non-governmental environmental organizations. It accepts only projects with proven additionality, and that have social and environmental benefits for local communities. Afforestation and reforestation projects are excluded, mainly because there is no guarantee that a forest will be permanent. When trees die, they release all the CO 2  they absorbed during their lives. So, if we can calculate our emissions and invest in the right schemes, could offsetting save the planet? Right now we are far from that goal. Around ten million tonnes of carbon dioxide were voluntarily offset in 2005 \u2014 less than 1% of the volume and value of transactions in mandatory carbon markets. And 25 billion tonnes of CO 2  entered the atmosphere. But the voluntary offset market is likely to grow exponentially. The German 3C, which handled the market transactions for FIFA's Green Goal, expects that its project-based transactions, currently 600,000 tonnes of CO 2 , will double in 2007. Worldwide, the voluntary market could grow by 40 times by 2010,according to a recent analysis by ICF, aLondon-based climate consultancy. Russ George, founder and president of the offsetting company Planktos, based in Foster City, California, is one of those thinking big. He plans a 10,000-hectare 'climate park' in Hungary. Plant ecologists with the Hungarian Academy of Sciences have conducted a feasibility study of the environmental impact and permanence of the project, and planting is to begin in 2007. Planktos is also offering credits for its controversial ocean eco-restoration projects, which involve fertilizing plankton growth with iron. \n               Bottom line \n             George believes voluntary offsetting could solve the problem of climate change. \u201cWe're expecting to save the world and make a little money on the side,\u201d he says. \u201cIn that order.\u201d Most experts agree that voluntary carbon offsetting could be part of a global strategy against climate change. But, they warn, most voluntary offsetting companies use small projects in developing countries, which together could account for only 3\u20135% of carbon emitted. Worse, overselling offsetting might persuade consumers that no other action is needed. \u201cThere's really nothing you can say against offsetting unavoidable emissions with truly permanent projects,\u201d says Olav Hohmeyer, an economist and renewable-energy expert at the University of Flensburg in Germany. \u201cMore importantly, however, consumers must question their behaviour.\u201d \u201cThe symbolic value is certainly high,\u201d adds Ottmar Edenhofer, an economist at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany. \u201cBut it's nonsense to believe that a little bit of goodwill is all it takes to solve the problem.\u201d Offsetting can deal with remaining emissions once avoidable energy consumption has been eliminated, he says. But most experts agree that the incentive to reduce consumption will come only when all sectors of business and industry are included in mandatory emissions-trading schemes. If they were, industry would have to reduce emissions, and consumers would change their behaviour as the price of carbon rose. For example, Edenhofer estimates that including aviation in EU emissions-trading schemes would make flights 50\u201380% more expensive. Only such a move would force people to reconsider flying, he says: \u201cCarbon dioxide must have a price \u2014 full stop.\u201d \n                 Additional reporting by Michael Hopkin. \n               \n                     Kyoto for commuters \n                   \n                     How much will it cost to save the world? \n                   \n                     Economists claim carbon cuts won't break the world's bank \n                   \n                     The costs of global warming \n                   \n                     Climate change in focus \n                   \n                     Regional climate change special \n                   \n                     Atmosfair \n                   \n                     CarbonNeutral Company \n                   \n                     MyClimate \n                   \n                     3C \n                   \n                     Carbon Trust \n                   \n                     Consumer Guide to Retail Offset Providers \n                   \n                     Gold Standard \n                   \n                     Planktos \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

A European mission to scan the skies for signs of other worlds is set to launch next week. The six-year mission will also measure ripples from stellar cores to find out what distant stars are made of. The French-led campaign is due to set off on 27 December from Baikonur, Kazakhstan. COROT, which stands for Convection Rotation and planetary Transits, has already been delayed twice because of problems with the Soyuz-Fregat launch vehicle, but mission staff are now confident that everything will go according to plan.  The COROT craft will be placed in a circular orbit that passes over Earth's poles, and within two months it should begin its first 150-day stare into space. During that time it will be scouring thousands of stars outside our Solar System for signs of orbiting planets (exoplanets). The plan is to spot these planets as they pass in front of \u2014 or 'transit' \u2014 their stars.  By measuring how much light is blotted out, astronomers can deduce the size of each planet. They can also work out the planet's mass by observing its effect on its parent star, allowing them to calculate the planet's density \u2014 and thus whether it is made of rock or gas.  \n              Planetary physics \n            So far, 209 extrasolar planets have been found. With information gathered by COROT's telescope, this number is set to rise rapidly. Over the next six years 120,000 stars will be scanned, says Malcolm Fridlund, a scientist on the project, which is run by the French space agency CNES, with help from the European Space Agency (ESA) and other partners in Europe and Brazil. \"COROT has the great opportunity to detect the first Earth-size planets around normal stars similar to the Sun,\" says Geoffrey Marcy of the University of California, Berkeley. Marcy is arguably the most successful planet-hunter to date \u2014 his team has spotted 121 of the 209 known exoplanets. COROT's 150-day scan time means it is most likely to spot planets with shorter, smaller orbits than Earth's, so is unlikely to find a true Earth analogue. But it will nonetheless provide useful statistics about the number of rocky planets that are out there.  \"With COROT, we will hopefully begin to map out the mass\u2013radius relation for close-in planets in detail, which will tell us a lot of about the internal physics and composition of extrasolar planets,\" says Scott Gaudi, an extrasolar scientist at Ohio State University in Columbus.  \n              Dual objectives \n            Besides searching for Earth-like planets, COROT will measure ripples on the surface of the stars and study how these change the wavelength of the stars' light. The ripples seen on a star's surface are caused by acoustical waves originating deep inside a star, so this information can give details about its inner workings. \"We can retrieve information about the stellar density and temperature profile and determine how the star rotates,\" says Fridlund. \"COROT is a mission with two objectives, and will be doing both of them in beautiful harmony.\" COROT is the first of an international battery of planned studies of distant stars. Following closely behind is NASA's Kepler mission, due to launch in late 2008, which will stare at the same place for four years, and may therefore spy an Earth-like planet in transit. After that are planned ESA's Darwin mission in 2015, and NASA's Terrestrial Planet Finder, though the funding and timing on these missions are uncertain. \n             Visit our  \n             \n                 newsblog \n               \n              to read and post comments about this story.  \n           \n                   Extrasolar planets \n                 \n                   CNES' COROT site \n                 \n                   ESA's COROT site \n                 \n                   The extrasolar planets encylopedia \n                 Reprints and Permissions"},

Tony Blair's choice of successor as Britain's prime minister has seemed little more than a formality since he announced in September that he would stand down. So UK scientists have begun to wonder what a government led by Gordon Brown, the current chancellor of the exchequer, would be like. A few hints emerged last week, when Brown unveiled his annual pre-budget report. UK researchers have rarely questioned Brown's commitment to research, given that he has boosted science spending by 70% to \u00a32.5 billion (US$4.9 billion) since 1997. But his largesse comes with a desire to micro-manage and a close eye on what industry wants. So it is little surprise that Brown's report reinforces his commitment to science, while raising fears about how he might govern it. For example, the report restated an intention, first aired in March, to ensure that the Department of Health's research funds actually get spent on research. At present, a sizeable fraction of the department's \u00a3600-million research budget gets diverted to the National Health Service. But Brown's blueprint for this reform looks complex and perhaps slanted in industry's favour. Funds for the Medical Research Council and the health department would be coordinated by a new body, the Office for Strategic Coordination of Health Research. Another new organization, the Translational Medicine Funding Board, would work with these to get results from bench to bedside, raising the possibility that basic-research funds could be raided to pay for work that industry wants done. Reforms to another mainstay of UK science have also received a mixed response. Every seven or so years, UK researchers undergo the Research Assessment Exercise (RAE), an expert review of university research used to distribute more than \u00a31 billion of government money to higher-education institutes. Pleas for reform of this time-consuming activity have grown louder in recent years, prompting Brown to launch a consultation on a metrics-based alternative earlier this year. With the results now announced, some critics may be wishing they had stayed silent. Measures of external research income, postgraduate training and research impact, the last by citation analysis, are broadly in line with what researchers wanted. The plan also fits the treasury's desire to streamline the process. But the proposals would almost completely eliminate peer review. Bibliometrics experts say properly weighted citation statistics produce the same results as expert review, but many, including the Royal Society, do not agree. Ole Petersen, a cell biologist at the University of Liverpool who chaired the society's RAE panel, uses the story of Nobel prizewinner Bert Sakmann to explain why. Sakmann's key paper on ion channels was published in 1976, but citations didn't take off until new experimental tools came into use a decade later. If metrics had been used to evaluate Sakmann's paper in the mid-1970s, they would have returned a low score. \u201cBut everyone knew this was a breakthrough,\u201d says Petersen. Even Brown's oft-repeated statement that science and the innovation that springs from it should be central to Britain's economy could prove controversial. Some suggest he may create a Ministry for Science to push the idea. But this could mean shifting more funds from basic to applied research, as Brown did with \u00a360 million of university money last week. Brown's spending increases have turned Britain's labs around, but some fear that the future may look less certain if applied research is seen as the  raison d'\u00eatre  of science. \u201cYou always have to be wary when people march down that road,\u201d says Peter Cotgreave, director of the Campaign for Science and Engineering, a London-based lobby group. \u201cThey can forget about the science base.\u201d \n                     Brown's budget briefing \n                   \n                     Britain spends to secure scientific growth \n                   \n                     White heat \u2014 at last \n                   \n                     HM Treasury 2006 Pre-budget report \n                   \n                     Campaign for Science and Engineering in the UK \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Australia has ended its ban on research that involves therapeutic cloning \u2014 giving researchers there a chance to join the small number of groups engaged in the procedure worldwide. A bill lifting the ban was passed by the Senate last month, and by the lower house on 12 December \u2014 despite being opposed by both prime minister John Howard and the leader of the opposition, Kevin Rudd. \u201cI was losing confidence that we had the support,\u201d says an elated Alan Trounson, director of the Monash Immunology and Stem Cell Laboratories in Melbourne. \u201cBut were able to win \u2014 even against the most powerful figures.\u201d Therapeutic cloning refers to the extraction of stem cells from embryos created by cloning, sometimes known as somatic\u2013nuclear cell transfer. It can potentially create stem cells from patients with diseases such as Alzheimer's, multiple sclerosis or diabetes. Trounson hopes to use such stem cells to study the progression of these diseases and their possible treatment. The bill repealed this month \u2014 the 2002 Prohibition of Human Cloning Act \u2014 banned the creation of cloned embryos for either reproduction or research. In 2004, Australia supported a US-led effort to have the United Nations ban all forms of cloning. But now Australia becomes one of several countries, including Britain, Finland, Singapore and South Korea, that specifically permit the creation of cloned embryos for research purposes under certain conditions. The United States has no law stating what work researchers may or may not do \u2014 but they cannot use federal funding for therapeutic cloning. US researchers nonetheless account for about half of the groups known to be pursuing research on therapeutic cloning. In 2005, a committee chaired by John Lockhart, a Sydney lawyer, reviewed Australia's 2002 cloning act. Its findings, which stressed the potential value of therapeutic cloning, are reflected in the new bill. But the same bottleneck that has limited research elsewhere in the world \u2014 the low availability of human eggs \u2014 will also slow therapeutic cloning in Australia. Eggs are needed to reprogramme donor cells to an embryonic state. Women who donate eggs must undergo the same invasive procedure as those who have  in vitro  fertilization (IVF), which carries a slight risk of serious side-effects (see  Nature   442 , 606\u2013608; 2006). Australia will forbid direct payments to egg donors, and its researchers will have to rely on altruistic donations or on eggs from ovaries that have been removed for medical reasons. \u201cThere is not going to be an avalanche of research in the field,\u201d says Tejia Peura, a stem-cell researcher at Sydney IVF, a fertility treatment company. She thinks that hers is one of three or four groups, at most, that will take up the research. But the bill also opens up other avenues of related investigation. Parthenogenetic activation of eggs, in which eggs start development without a sperm, will be allowed, for example. So will research involving the transfer of cytoplasm, the material surrounding the nucleus of an egg. The latter could lend insight into why eggs age, and, perhaps, offer hope for families with an abnormality in the cytoplasmic mitochondrial DNA that causes Leigh's disease in children. The bill will, however, prohibit the production of human embryonic stem cells by injecting human donor cells into animal eggs. Details of how the change will be implemented, including licensing requirements for researchers, are expected early in the new year. Trounson says he cannot wait to get started, but adds that the widespread support the measure attracted has also been a huge boost for scientists' morale. \u201cIt was a great show of democracy in Australia,\u201d he says. \n                     Cloning: Mining the secrets of the egg \n                   \n                     Australia considers changing laws to allow therapeutic cloning \n                   \n                     Making stem cells web focus \n                   \n                     Stem Cells in focus \n                   \n                     Stem cells insight \n                   \n                     Stem cells podcast \n                   \n                     25 years of embryonic stem cells \n                   \n                     Lockhart report \n                   \n                     Monash Immunology and Stem Cell Laboratories (MISCL) \n                   \n                     Sydney IVF \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

San Diego The prestigious Salk Institute for Biological Studies is on the brink of change. Fresh leadership at the California research facility in La Jolla is set to direct it towards a major expansion. The search for a president has already begun after neuroscientist Richard Murphy announced on 8 December that he will leave next July, after nearly seven years in the post. And Irwin Jacobs, an electrical engineer who led his company, San Diego-based Qualcomm, to pre-eminence in mobile-phone technology, assumed the nine-year chairmanship of the Salk board last month. Billionaire Jacobs is a popular choice. He has a stellar international business reputation, a track record in philanthropy, and is the first board chair to come from the Salk's home town. \u201cThese developments create the opportunity for the Salk to unlock its substantial potential,\u201d says Kenneth Chien, a Harvard physician who has a Salk adjunct faculty position. \u201cThis is a very opportune moment to capitalize on a science-driven agenda.\u201d Although it has only 62 faculty members, the Salk has set a sterling record for answering some of the most basic questions in biology, and its strength and direction are closely watched. The leadership changes come as the institute prepares to complete an expansion first envisaged in the 1960s, when polio researcher Jonas Salk founded the institute. Whereas three other non-profit research institutes in San Diego's cluster recently accepted lavish financial payouts to open labs in Florida, Salk officials spurned its suitors (see  Nature   442 , 729; 2006). \u201cThree or four Florida groups asked us to consider moving,\u201d says Murphy. \u201cWe were not interested. Our strength is remaining small and interactive.\u201d The Salk plan calls for a new building for labs; a research facility for photonics, mass spectroscopy and human stem-cell projects; a child-care centre; and ocean-view residences for visiting scientists. Salk officials hope to win the necessary government approvals by next June, while launching a funding drive for the project. Costs are estimated to exceed $100 million. The institute is considered a national architectural landmark \u2014 it was designed by Louis Kahn and crowns an ocean-front cliff. So the expansion is already drawing fire. A local design organization has criticized the plan, even though much of the new building will be underground, temporary structures and parking lots will disappear, and no final model has been decided. Having Jacobs as board chairman should help considerably, though, especially given his services to the community \u2014 his many donations include $110 million to the University of California, San Diego, and $120 million to the San Diego Symphony. \u201cWe plan to focus on raising money for the institute's scientific work,\u201d says Jacobs. The number of faculty to be added with the expansion has not been decided, but a 10% increase has been suggested. Murphy's tenure had been a fruitful one. During his term, 16 faculty members were hired, major research centres were created, about a third of the labs were renovated and the endowment rose. \u201cIt's been a great six years,\u201d says Murphy. \u201cI thought it best to go before the institute started the capital campaign.\u201d Looking to the future, faculty head Inder Verma says: \u201cFor the first time, we have a board chairman who is from San Diego; this is very positive. He is a community leader with academic credentials.\u201d On the presidential search, Verma notes: \u201cThe faculty would prefer someone from outside, to bring in new blood.\u201d \n                     The Salk Institute \n                   \n                     Salk building plan \n                   \n                     Irwin Jacobs profile \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

This molecular 'lock and key' process is thought to lie behind a wide range of the body's detection systems: it is how some parts of the immune system recognise invaders, for example, and how the tongue recognizes some tastes. But Turin argued that smell doesn't seem to fit this picture very well. Molecules that look almost identical can smell very different \u2014 such as alcohols, which smell like spirits, and thiols, which smell like rotten eggs. And molecules with very different structures can smell similar. Most strikingly, some molecules can smell different \u2014 to animals, if not necessarily to humans \u2014 simply because they contain different isotopes (atoms that are chemically identical but have a different mass). Turin's explanation for these smelly facts invokes the idea that the smell signal in olfactory receptor proteins is triggered not by an odour molecule's shape, but by its vibrations, which can enourage an electron to jump between two parts of the receptor in a quantum-mechanical process called tunnelling. This electron movement could initiate the smell signal being sent to the brain. This would explain why isotopes can smell different: their vibration frequencies are changed if the atoms are heavier. Turin's mechanism, says Marshall Stoneham of the UCL team, is more like swipe-card identification than a key fitting a lock. Vibration-assisted electron tunnelling can undoubtedly occur \u2014 it is used in an experimental technique for measuring molecular vibrations. \"The question is whether this is possible in the nose,\" says Stoneham's colleague, Andrew Horsfield.  \n              Unbelievable \n            Stoneham says that when he first heard about Turin's idea, while Turin was himself based at UCL, \"I didn't believe it\". But, he adds, \"because it was an interesting idea, I thought I should prove it couldn't work. I did some simple calculations, and only then began to feel Luca could be right.\" Now Stoneham and his co-workers have done the job more thoroughly, in a paper soon to be published in  Physical Review Letters . The UCL team calculated the rates of electron hopping in a nose receptor that has an odorant molecule bound to it. This rate depends on various properties of the biomolecular system that are not known, but the researchers could estimate these parameters based on typical values for molecules of this sort. The key issue is whether the hopping rate with the odorant in place is significantly greater than that without it. The calculations show that it is \u2014 which means that odour identification in this way seems theoretically possible.   But Horsfield stresses that that's different from a proof of Turin's idea. \"So far things look plausible, but we need proper experimental verification. We're beginning to think about what experiments could be performed.\" Meanwhile, Turin is pressing ahead with his hypothesis. \"At Flexitral we have been designing odorants exclusively on the basis of their computed vibrations,\" he says. \"Our success rate at odorant discovery is two orders of magnitude better than the competition.\" At the very least, he is putting his money where his nose is. \n             Visit our  \n             \n                 newsblog \n               \n              to read and post comments about this story.  \n           \n                   Could humans recognize odor by phonon assisted tunneling? \n                 \n                   Flexitral \n                 Reprints and Permissions"},

Washington DC In a late-night flurry of activity as it rushed to adjourn, the US Congress last week created a new agency that will allocate $1 billion to companies that are developing drugs and vaccines to tackle bioterror and pandemic agents. Bleary-eyed lawmakers also passed legislation governing the broad workings of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and authorizing a hefty budget boost for the biomedical agency over the next two years. Both bills \u2014 which President Bush is expected to sign into law as soon as this week \u2014 faced long odds as the Republican-dominated Congress entered its final hours before ceding control of both the House and the Senate to Democrats in January. But the determination of Republicans to leave on a note of achievement, and the insistence of Joe Barton (Republican, Texas), who chairs the energy and commerce committee, that the NIH bill must be passed by the Senate for the popular bioterror measure to be brought to a vote in the House, combined to push both measures through. The complex horse-trading also involved a state-run health-insurance programme for children. The biodefence bill establishes a new agency \u2014 the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) \u2014 as part of the Department of Health and Human Services. The agency will initially get $1 billion over two years to fund civilian research on countermeasures to bioterror and pandemic threats. Senator Richard Burr (Republican, North Carolina), who sponsored the bill, describes BARDA as \u201can aggressive venture capitalist\u201d that will partner universities and companies to help them through middle- and late-stage drug development and manufacture. The bill had broad bipartisan support, including co-sponsorship by Senator Edward Kennedy (Democrat, Massachusetts), whose state is a hub of biotechnology firms, and Senator Hillary Clinton (Democrat, New York), whose constituents suffered the most in the attacks of 11 September 2001. The BARDA bill has long been a darling of industry, which had lobbied for its passage.Its backers noted that the $5.6-billion Project BioShield, which was passed into law in 2004, provides funds for the government to buy vaccines and drugs once they are ready for use. At earlier stages in drug and vaccine development \u2014 stages the industry has termed the 'Valley of Death' \u2014 companies are therefore left to push forward at their own expense. \u201cThis legislation recognizes that the 'Valley of Death' remains a barrier to effective countermeasure product development,\u201d Jim Greenwood, a former Republican congressman who is president of the Washington-based Biotechnology Industry Organization, said in a statement after the Senate passed the measure to create BARDA. Other proponents argue that developing agents to tackle what are only potential attacks and pandemics is far riskier than investing in a new diabetes medicine, for example, and that it's reasonable to expect the government to share that risk. \u201cIt's like a B2 bomber,\u201d says Francesca Cook, vice-president of policy and government affairs at PharmAthene, a company based in Annapolis, Maryland, that is developing prophylactics and treatments against anthrax and chemical nerve agents. \u201cOnly the Department of Defense is going to buy that.\u201d But critics say the bill is a blatant giveaway to business, a security risk and a wasteful move in an era of ballooning federal deficits. \u201cI don't know when this terrible cycle of splurging on biodefence is going to end,\u201d says Ed Hammond, director of the US office of the Sunshine Project, a bioweapons watchdog group based in Austin, Texas, and Hamburg, Germany. \u201cI don't think we need nearly 20,000 people at over 400 institutions researching biological weapons agents.\u201d Hammond refers to numbers compiled by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, Georgia, which reports periodically on the number of people and institutions registered to handle potential bioweapons agents. He worries that the sheer number of people involved in such research increases US vulnerability to domestic terrorism, and encourages other countries to enter a race that could lead to the offensive use of biological weapons. Fiscal conservatives also bemoaned the BARDA bill's passage by a Congress that has spent $26.7 billion on civilian biodefence since 2001. \u201cThe creation of a new office is always suspect,\u201d says Tom Finnigan, a spokesman for Citizens Against Government Waste, a Washington-based group that monitors government spending, \u201cbecause it will be duplicating roles that already exist. And it will never go away. Even if they stockpile all the vaccines they need, the office won't close down. It will expand its mission, inevitably.\u201d The other bill passed in the small hours on Saturday was the National Institutes of Health Reform Act of 2006. For the first time since 1993, it offers broad guidance and new requirements for the structure and running of the NIH. Barton, the bill's author, noted that even as the agency's budget doubled between 1998 and 2003, its \u201chodge-podge\u201d structure was left untouched. The bill caps the number of institutes at the current 27, and requires the agency's director to submit biennial reports to Congress cataloguing all NIH research and justifying the individual institutes' priorities. It requires the NIH to set up a user-friendly electronic system to uniformly code all its grants and activities. And it establishes a 'common fund', comprising up to 5% of the total NIH budget in any given year, for research involving more than one NIH institute. But the most eye-catching provision is a funding boost that would increase the biomedical agency's budget by more than $4 billion to $32.8 billion in 2008. But there is no guarantee that the money will materialize. That remains in the hands of the congressional appropriating committees that fund the NIH year by year. \u201cWe recognize that it's not money in the bank and that we'll have to convince appropriators to do the same,\u201d says Howard Garrison, a spokesman for the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology. \u201cBut this is a good sign. It's a strong endorsement of the NIH.\u201d \n                     News in brief \n                   \n                     Physics wins the US budget race \n                   \n                     Network of concern \n                   \n                     Boom, or bust? \n                   \n                     Anthrax web focus \n                   \n                     The Sunshine Project \n                   \n                     University of Pittsburgh Center for Biosecurity \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Last week's dramatic failure of a drug trial aimed at boosting 'good' cholesterol is bad news for Pfizer, the world's largest drug company. But will it also dash the hopes of those looking for a new way of preventing heart attacks? Until now, the cholesterol story has been portrayed as a simple one, with just two characters: 'bad' cholesterol, which promotes heart disease, and 'good' cholesterol, which protects against it. Driving down levels of the former helps the heart, as should boosting levels of the latter. The first idea is broadly accepted, thanks to statins, the best-selling drugs that cut levels of bad cholesterol (more properly called low-density lipoproteins, or LDLs). But with Pfizer being obliged on 2 December to abandon trials of its drug candidate torcetrapib, which was designed to increase levels of good cholesterol, the second idea has suffered a serious setback. The trial in 15,000 people was called off because of the increased number of people who had died after taking the drug and a statin for 18\u201320 months, compared with a group taking the statin alone; 82 people died on the combined therapy, compared with 51 on the statin. \u201cThis cancellation came as a complete shock,\u201d says John Chapman, who has studied torcetrapib at the biomedical research institute INSERM in Paris. But not everyone was so surprised. Some specialists have been harbouring doubts that certain ways of raising good cholesterol \u2014 high-density lipoproteins, or HDLs \u2014 might cause more problems than they solve. Bumping up HDL levels makes sense on the basis of many epidemiological studies showing that people with low levels of HDLs tend to be at higher risk of heart disease. But Pfizer's trial was one of the first to test whether this beneficial effect could be mimicked using a drug to specifically boost levels of HDLs. HDLs labour away in the bloodstream like a huge fleet of garbage trucks, carting off cholesterol to the liver for safe disposal. LDLs do the opposite, dumping their cholesterol load in blood vessels where it can accumulate and potentially clog the vessels. Torcetrapib works by inhibiting a protein called cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP), which moves cholesterol from HDLs to LDLs. This, it was hoped, would help clear more cholesterol from the bloodstream. As Wall Street frets over the implications of Pfizer's failed trial (see  page 805 ), cardiovascular specialists are equally abuzz about why the failure occurred. They want to know whether the problem lies with this drug alone, whether all drugs that inhibit CETP might be prone to similar problems, or whether meddling with HDL levels is inherently dangerous. The last possibility would have serious repercussions for researchers and drug companies already investing heavily in an array of other methods to boost or alter HDL levels. The reason for the increased deaths in the trial participants will not become clear until the results of the abandoned trial are released. One hint lies in evidence from earlier studies that torcetrapib raises blood pressure in some people. That might have proved fatal in patients with already raised blood pressure. If this is the case \u2014 or if the problems are caused by some other factor unique to torcetrapib \u2014 then other drugs being developed to inhibit CETP might not suffer the same downfall. One drug being developed by Roche, for example, is thought to interact with a different part of the CETP molecule and might not affect blood pressure. But some researchers are asking whether the very concept of inhibiting CETP is flawed. Normally, when the HDL trucks dump their cholesterol at the liver, they do so by offloading some of it to LDLs on the way. But CETP partially prevents the transfer of cholesterol from HDLs to LDLs, so there has been some debate about whether drugs such as torcetrapib could cause HDLs to accumulate large amounts of cholesterol that they cannot traffic out of the body normally. \u201cYou're blocking a physiological mechanism to eliminate cholesterol,\u201d says Moti Kashyap, who directs atherosclerosis research at the VA Medical Center in Long Beach, California. According to other experts, the idea of boosting good cholesterol may be far too simplistic to start with. HDLs are complicated particles, they point out, composed of different proteins and lipids. Each particle's components and chemical modifications are thought to affect how it behaves, and some recent studies have suggested that certain variants of HDLs may actually promote cardiovascular disease. In one such study, a team led by Ben Ansell at the University of California, Los Angeles, studied people who defy medical expectation because they have particularly high HDL levels, but still develop heart disease. In lab assays, the team found that HDLs from these people behave in ways that could promote the build-up of cholesterol in the arteries rather than protect against it (B. J. Ansell  et al .  Circulation   108 , 2751\u20132756; 2003). Similarly, Ansell says, Pfizer's drug might have favoured the formation of damaging or dysfunctional forms of HDL. He adds that his finding is \u201cvery analogous to what I'm sure happened in this trial\u201d. Following this line of thinking, HDLs themselves should be reclassified into 'good' and 'bad' forms. This means that total HDL levels could be a poor measure of its actions and that heart drugs would work only if they boost the correct form of HDL. \u201cIt might not be enough to have a lot of HDL \u2014 what matters is how that HDL functions,\u201d says Prediman Shah, director of cardiology and atherosclerosis at the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. Some researchers are optimistic about efforts to boost one of these particularly 'good' breeds, a variant of a protein found in HDL. The protein, called ApoA-1 Milano, was found in residents of a rural Italian village who have very low HDL levels but do not seem to be prone to cardiovascular problems. In 2003, a team led by Steven Nissen of the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio showed that five infusions of this protein in humans shrank plaques in the arteries (S. E. Nissen  et al .  J. Am. Med. Assoc .  290 , 2292\u20132300; 2003). The approach is now being pursued by Pfizer. Many cholesterol specialists say they are still optimistic that, by one means or another, tweaking HDLs can add to the benefits already accrued by statins. But at least some admit that the case for raising good cholesterol is nowhere near as watertight as that for lowering bad cholesterol. \u201cThere are many ways to raise HDLs. The problem is we really don't know if any of them work [to prevent the cardiovascular disease],\u201d says Christie Ballantyne, a cardiovascular specialist at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, Texas. \n                     Why did a promising heart drug fail? \n                   \n                     The bitterest pill \n                   \n                     Pfizer hires 'outsider' for insider top job \n                   \n                     Tackle your cholesterol early \n                   \n                     Profile: Steve Nissen \n                   \n                     American Heart Association \n                   \n                     Pfizer \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Nine months after serious allegations were levelled against high-profile 'bubble fusion' research at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana, the institution is being criticized by researchers within and outside its walls for its apparent failure to respond. Lefteri Tsoukalas, head of the nuclear-engineering school where the work was carried out, resigned his position in October, expressing disappointment over the slow pace and secrecy of the university's response. Last week, he made his concerns public. In an open letter from his lawyer to Purdue's provost Sally Mason, Tsoukalas called for the university to release an interim report on its progress. \u201cPurdue is a great public university, not a private club,\u201d he told  Nature . In response, Purdue spokesman Joe Bennett confirmed for the first time that there is an ongoing inquiry at the university. \u201cWe are not going to have any comment while this is under way,\u201d he said. The allegations relate to the work of Rusi Taleyarkhan, a professor of nuclear engineering at Purdue. Since 2002, Taleyarkhan has published three major papers claiming to have achieved nuclear fusion by using sound waves to collapse bubbles in deuterated liquids, raising the prospect of a virtually unlimited energy source 1 , 2 , 3 . Tsoukalas' letter comes days after the announcement that a Texas physicist, working with Taleyarkhan in his lab, has achieved similar results (see  'Bubbling up' ). In March,  Nature  reported concerns over the validity and reliability of Taleyarkhan's work 4 , based on statements made by members of Purdue's nuclear-engineering school, as well as an analysis by physicist Brian Naranjo at the University of California, Los Angeles. Naranjo's study 5  showed that the spectrum of neutrons produced by Taleyarkhan's experiments fits not fusion, but the radioactive decay of californium, a standard lab material. Purdue quickly announced that a university panel would review Taleyarkhan's work and make the findings public. In June, it said the review was complete but that its findings and any future steps would remain confidential. Since then, Purdue has released no information (until Bennett's comment this week) about whether or not it is investigating Taleyarkhan. Tsoukalas says he decided to write to Purdue because he had received no adequate response to his concerns since he first expressed them in March. Purdue's policies suggest a timeline of three months for investigating misconduct allegations. Other researchers in the field are also far from impressed by the apparent lack of progress. Ken Suslick, for example, a professor of chemistry at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, sent a confidential note in June to Purdue's associate vice-president for research, Peter Dunn, stating that he believed Taleyarkhan's research claims are fraudulent. Suslick detailed a number of reasons for his view, including Naranjo's analysis; the fact that other teams were unable to repeat the work; and an experimental demonstration he attended at which he believed data were being \u201ccherry-picked\u201d by Taleyarkhan. Suslick has received no reply from Purdue. \u201cThey have to be careful what they say in case the accusations are false, so I'm not horrified they didn't respond,\u201d Suslick says. \u201cBut it is in keeping with their other foot-dragging. At some point they have to say that they have had an investigation and that they either exonerated him or didn't.\u201d Internally, misconduct allegations have been made that centre on the claim that Taleyarkhan wrote up work with his postdoc Yiban Xu claiming to have achieved bubble fusion, then left his own name off the resulting paper (he is listed in the acknowledgments) 6 . Taleyarkhan cited this study in a later paper 3  as independent confirmation of his work. Taleyarkhan has indicated that he is unable to respond to requests for comment about the various allegations because this might violate university's confidentiality procedures. But Taleyarkhan's co-author, Richard Lahey of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, New York, has defended him. \u201cAs far as I have been told, [the data] were taken by the authors of this paper,\u201d Lahey says. Concerns have been raised, however, over the fact that data published in Xu's paper are apparently identical to separate data reported by Taleyarkhan. Xu included a figure showing microphone measurements taken during a fusion experiment at Purdue. It includes data that look identical to those reported by Taleyarkhan from a prior experiment carried out at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee 7 , where he previously worked, as well as those presented by him in a slideshow for DARPA, the Pentagon's research agency, in 2005. The results from Oak Ridge and Purdue were reported to have been produced under different experimental conditions, and the papers have no common authors. Xu has defended the measurements as his own, but declined to say who wrote the paper. Nature  showed the data to three scientists from different groups in the field. All concluded that the measurements must have been taken from the same experiment, because different acoustic cells tend to have characteristic outputs. Lahey disagrees. \u201cIf the test sections were of the same design (which they were), the response during cavitation events will be essentially the same,\u201d he says. For Tsoukalas, the lack of word from Purdue is damaging the reputations of all concerned. In the letter to Mason, Tsoukalas's lawyer, Philip Michael, writes: \u201cSignificant time has now elapsed since the Purdue Administration made any public statement on the progress of its investigation, inquiry or examination of the allegations of misconduct which Professor Tsoukalas and other researchers have made... we believe that it is appropriate to ask for an interim report.\u201d \n                     Concerns grow over secrecy of bubble-fusion inquiry \n                   \n                     Bubble fusion: silencing the hype \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

With President George W. Bush and his administration continuing to avoid the issue, the courts and Congress are poised to shape climate-change policy in the United States. Last week, the Supreme Court heard a high-profile case in which Massachusetts, along with numerous other states, cities and environmental groups, argued that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) should be forced to regulate greenhouse-gas emissions from cars and trucks as a pollutant. Massachusetts itself stands to lose 300 kilometres of its coastline as a result of the rise in sea level as the planet warms. The suit can be read as an expression of many states' impatience with the federal government's inaction on climate change (see  Nature   443 , 486\u2013487; 2006). Meanwhile, staff in the offices of Democratic politicians are sharpening their pencils for January, when the more liberal party takes over Congress, and supporters hope that climate-change bills will fly. The verdict will be announced by the Supreme Court by the end of its term in June. Although the EPA trotted out the same old administration line that the \u201cscientific uncertainty\u201d was too great to act upon, the discussions during the 29 November hearing hint that the case might be decided on the technical grounds of standing \u2014 Massachusetts could sue the agency only if the harm suffered will be redressed if the EPA does act. The problem is that climate change is such a large and global problem that the emissions in question \u2014 from the tailpipes of US vehicles \u2014 may not make a huge difference by themselves. Massachusetts will probably still lose a considerable chunk of coastline. Beneath the issue of standing, there seems to be a schism of opinion on more ideological grounds, with the more conservative judges looking likely to support the EPA, and the more liberal judges lining up with the Massachusetts group. With four justices on each side, Justice Anthony Kennedy, a noted moderate, may have the casting vote. But many observers say that the decision itself will be less important than the buzz around the case. \u201cI think no matter which way it breaks, it will put more pressure on Congress,\u201d says Andrew Aulisi of the World Resources Institute, an environmental think-tank in Washington DC. If the Supreme Court sides with the EPA, he says, \u201ceverybody is going to throw up their hands and say that the judiciary isn't doing anything and Congress needs to step in\u201d. When the Democrats take control of Congress in January, the prediction for the first months is a steady diet of hearings, with bills taking a little longer. No one is quite sure if the votes are there for a tough bill on climate change. \u201cWhat the elections did, to a large extent, was replace Republican moderates with Democratic moderates,\u201d says Manik Roy, director of congressional affairs at the Pew Center on Global Climate Change. \u201cYou don't have many more votes. What has changed is who controls the agenda.\u201d Senator Barbara Boxer (Democrat, California), who will head the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, has promised lots of talk and action on climate change, and on 15 November sent a letter with two other heads of related committees to President Bush, asking for a commitment to \u201cpass meaningful climate change legislation in 2007\u201d. Republican Senator (and probable presidential candidate) from Arizona, John McCain, will also undoubtedly reintroduce the McCain\u2013Lieberman Climate Change Act, a cap-and-trade bill, for its third outing. Frank Maisano, a spokesman for Bracewell & Giuliani, a law firm representing oil and gas industries, cautions that advocates for climate-change regulation have been overtaken by unrealistic exuberance. The complexity of the issue will push substantive action way past the verdict, he says. \u201cIt is not something that is going to be slam-dunked in 12 months.\u201d But even if the rounds of hearings seem to produce nothing but hot air, Roy points out that they will at least educate members of Congress, where, for example, Senator James Inhofe (Republican, Oklahoma) has been holding forth on his view of climate change as some sort of conspiracy theory. \u201cI would not in any way consider it a delay tactic if Congress spends a year holding hearings on this issue,\u201d Roy says. \n                     US Supreme Court hears climate case \n                   \n                     Britain plans tough limits to curb emissions \n                   \n                     Britain aims to take lead on aggressive carbon cuts \n                   \n                     Economic review counts costs of climate change \n                   \n                     Climate in court \n                   \n                     Going to court over climate change \n                   \n                     Climate change in focus \n                   \n                     Massachusetts Attorney General's page on the case \n                   \n                     The case on the Supreme Court docket \n                   \n                     The argument transcript in full \n                   \n                     Senators' letter to George W.

Washington DC In a notable move aimed at curbing fraud in scientific publications, the journal  Science  said last week that it will probably begin targeting certain \u201chigh-risk\u201d papers for extra scrutiny. The move comes in response to a report from an external committee convened by the journal to assess its handling of the papers behind the Woo Suk Hwang fraud scandal. And it turns on its head \u2014 for a handful of papers at least \u2014 the traditional presumption that manuscripts submitted to a journal are researched and written honestly. \u201cUntil now, it has been assumed as a default that scientists are honest. The burden of proof is to show that they are not. Now, at least for a select number of papers where the risk factor is high, there is a new burden, to show that these papers are honest,\u201d says Sheldon Krimsky, a bioethicist at Tufts University in Medford, Massachusetts. Hwang, a South Korean researcher working at Seoul National University, published high-profile papers in  Science 1 , 2  in 2004 and 2005 that claimed to have generated embryonic stem cells by somatic-cell nuclear transfer. This is a key step to generating replacement tissues from a patient's own cells. Both papers turned out to have been fabricated, and  Science  retracted them in January 3 . The review committee, headed by John Brauman, a chemist at Stanford University in California, released its report into  Science 's conduct last week. Although  Science  had followed high-standard editorial procedures \u201cwith exceptional care\u201d in the Hwang case, Brauman says, \u201cwe suggested that the journal institute a policy we describe as risk assessment\u201d in an effort to clamp down on fraud. Writing in an editorial 4 ,  Science 's editor-in-chief Donald Kennedy said that the journal is now developing criteria for deciding which papers deserve particularly careful scrutiny. \u201cPapers that are of substantial public interest, present results that are unexpected and/or counterintuitive, or touch on areas of high political controversy may fall into this category,\u201d he wrote. Such papers, perhaps ten a year, would receive \u201cspecial attention\u201d that could include greater requirements for including primary data and more intensive evaluation of digital images. The journal would also demand explicit descriptions of each author's contribution to a paper. Even as Kennedy announced the plans,  Science  reported doubts about the results of another high-profile paper it recently published in a controversial area of developmental biology. Pending the outcome of an investigation by the University of Missouri, Columbia, this will also probably be retracted. In a paper 5  that sparked debate from the moment it was published, R. Michael Roberts and colleagues, researchers at the university, claimed that mouse embryonic cells have distinct developmental fates from the first cell division onwards. This flies in the face of the broadly held view that in mammals such cells can still develop into any cell in the body. The paper was published on 17 February this year, and the university launched an investigation in April that is still continuing. Kennedy cautioned in a press briefing that the social costs associated with loss of trust among scientists might be greater than those of the occasional retraction. But he said he would collaborate with  Nature  and other journals to draw up a common set of standards aimed at deterring fraud. Philip Campbell,  Nature's  editor-in-chief, declined to comment in detail on the committee's findings, but said: \u201cWe at  Nature  welcome the external review conducted by  Science  and are considering its recommendations.\u201d But many commentators seem to feel that the recommendations don't go far enough. \u201cThere should be very strict criteria not only for high-impact or controversial papers but for everybody,\u201d says Thereza Imanishi-Kari, an immunogeneticist at Tufts. Imanishi-Kari's career stalled when her work became the subject of a high-profile US government investigation in the 1990s. She was exonerated. Krimsky also favours increased scrutiny of papers: \u201dWhat could the negative impacts be? A less trusting community of scientists? A new McCarthyism? I don't think that's likely.\u201d He adds that a further criterion should trigger extra scrutiny of papers: where an author or authors have an unusually high degree of commercial interest in the results. Meanwhile, Arthur Caplan, director of the Center for Bioethics at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, says he would like to see the criteria expanded to include papers in areas with a history of fraud and those in highly specialized areas where relatively few other scientists would be equipped to detect such problems. He adds: \u201cI think you have to be blunt and say that papers coming from certain countries also raise red flags. China has not yet been convincing and South Korea has problems.\u201d But Kennedy said in the press briefing that he would guard against any targeting of foreign scientists. \u201cWe don't want to engage in profiling. It would really be unfair if we started looking extra hard at some of the papers from emerging scientific powers in countries such as South Korea.\u201d \n                     Hwang takes the stand at fraud trial \n                   \n                     Should journals police scientific fraud? \n                   \n                     Verdict: Hwang's human stem cells were all fakes \n                   \n                     Rise and fall \n                   \n                     Woo Suk Hwang special \n                   \n                     Stem Cells in focus \n                   \n                     Nature Medicine May 2006 fraud special \n                   \n                     The Science committee's report \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

International experts in DNA forensics say that a paper published online by  Nature  this week provides a firm alibi for the six medical workers facing the death penalty in Libya. The workers have been charged with deliberately infecting more than 400 children with HIV in 1998. In the study, an international team led by researchers from Oxford and Rome used the genetic sequences of the viruses isolated from the patients to reconstruct the exact phylogeny, or 'family tree', of the outbreak. Analysing the mutations that accumulated over time allowed the researchers to work out when different outbreaks occurred. They showed that the strain of HIV with which the children had been infected was already present and spreading locally in the mid-1990s, long before the medics arrived in Libya in 1998. The trial of the six medical workers ended in Tripoli on 4 November, and a verdict is expected on 19 December. Despite mounting international pressure to free them, defence lawyers are pessimistic about the outcome, and  Nature  has fast-tracked publication to make this new evidence available before the verdict (see  Nature  444 , 2006 ). There was already a body of scientific evidence indicating that the outbreak was caused not by deliberate transmission, but by poor hygiene at the Al-Fateh hospital in Benghazi, where the outbreak took place (see  Nature   443 , 888\u2013889; 2006). Analysis of hospital records suggested that the outbreak began before the medics arrived. And almost half of the HIV-infected children were also infected with hepatitis B or C, pointing to poor hospital practices as the cause. The new results provide independent genetic confirmation of these findings. As well as showing that the outbreaks predated the medics' arrival, the study suggests that the HIV strain is related most closely to strains from West Africa, suggesting a natural introduction, probably via the many migrant workers in Libya, says co-author Tulio de Oliveira of the University of Oxford, UK. Other phylogenetic analyses of HIV have been used in court cases involving allegations of HIV infection. The first was in 1991, when a Florida dentist was shown to have contaminated his patients. The technique has since been accepted as evidence in dozens of cases involving rape, hospital infection transmissions and people with HIV knowingly exposing others in Sweden, France and elsewhere. Thomas Leitner of Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico has provided forensic HIV evidence in more than 30 such cases over the past 15 years. He describes the de Oliveira paper as \u201ccompelling evidence that the outbreak had started before the accused could have started it\u201d, a view shared by every expert that  Nature  contacted (see  'Expert opinion' ). Leitner points out that calculating evolutionary timescales is tricky, but that because HIV has such a fast mutation rate, even recent events can be pinpointed quite accurately. \u201cDe Oliveira  et al . have tested and evaluated the clock and its uncertainty using several methods,\u201d he says. \u201cI find their analysis well done and timely, and hope it will affect the judgement in the Libyan court.\u201d \n                     Molecular Epidemiology: HIV-1 and HCV sequences from Libyan outbreak \n                   \n                     Libya death-penalty trial ends \n                   \n                     'A shocking lack of evidence' \n                   \n                     Protests mount against Libyan trial \n                   \n                     Lawyers call for science to clear AIDS nurses in Libya \n                   \n                     Libya's travesty \n                   \n                     Aids Medics in Libya web focus \n                   \n                     Resources page on Libya trial \n                   \n                     AAAS Human Rights Action Network \n                   \n                     Amnesty International on Libya \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

The US government is pushing ahead with a plan to overhaul its nuclear stockpile, despite a scientific review showing that existing warheads will last at least another half-century. On 1 December, the National Nuclear Security Administration \u2014 the agency that oversees the US nuclear stockpile \u2014 announced that it will pursue plans to develop a new Reliable Replacement Warhead (RRW), which it claims will be safer and more robust than current designs. But the announcement came just two days after the release of research showing that the plutonium in existing warheads has a shelf-life of at least a century. Most warheads in the US stockpile are only about 20 years old. Critics say the decision to proceed is an example of politics trumping science. \u201cIt is clear that the present stockpile is going to be reliable beyond our lifetime,\u201d says Jay Coghlan, executive director of Nuclear Watch, a watchdog group in Santa Fe, New Mexico. \u201cIt's not the science that rules, it's the special interests.\u201d But officials maintain that the programme was never solely about replacing old warheads. \u201cI believe the reasons for the RRW are in some ways independent of plutonium ageing,\u201d says Charles McMillan, associate director for weapons physics at Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico. \u201cRRW enables us to bring new technologies to the table.\u201d Since 2004, the RRW concept has been gathering momentum \u2014 both at the nation's nuclear weapons labs and in Congress (see  Nature   442 , 18\u201321; 2006). The idea is to build a new generation of robust warheads to replace existing designs. They would be larger than existing warheads, but would have a greater margin of error, be easier to manufacture and include more safeguards. The proposed designs have mainly focused on making changes to the plutonium triggers, or pits, of the current warheads. Some argue that adding more plutonium or changing the way they are cast would result in a more stable, dependable trigger that could sit on the shelf for years without testing. Officials have pushed for the programme to proceed quickly because of concerns that the ageing triggers on the current warheads might become unreliable within a few decades. The chief worry was that the constant stream of radiation that comes from the plutonium itself could create cavities in its crystalline structure, causing the weapon to fail. But a trawl of old nuclear test data and a battery of lab tests have shown this isn't the case. Some of the 1,054 nuclear tests carried out by the United States before 1992 were done with ageing weapons, and the data helped scientists understand how older plutonium triggers behave. Meanwhile, researchers also discovered that artificially aged plutonium heals itself by shifting new atoms back into its crystalline lattice. The current generation of weapons can therefore last for at least 85\u2013100 years. These findings are likely to have implications elsewhere, especially in Britain, which is thought to have warheads similar to the US design. Other nations such as France use plutonium triggers and have stockpile stewardship programmes. The findings were \u201ca real surprise\u201d, says Raymond Jeanloz, a geologist at the University of California, Berkeley, and a member of the JASONs \u2014 an independent scientific group that advises the US government on security issues and that reviewed the work. \u201cThe labs have done an outstanding job.\u201d The revised lifetimes call into question the need for an RRW programme, say many critics. RRW was sold to congressional supporters on the basis that the ageing stockpile would soon have to be replaced anyway. But as it will be in good condition for the conceivable future, such a plan now seems unnecessary, says Christopher Paine, a nuclear analyst at the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group based in New York. \u201cThe arguments with which they won congressional support have fallen apart.\u201d McMillan counters that the RRW has always been about more than just replacing older warheads. \u201cRRW will bring to the stockpile the most modern technologies for safety and security,\u201d he says. In addition, he says, the process of developing and producing the RRW will help transform the weapons complex into a smaller, more responsive one. If nothing else, the extended shelf-life of the current warheads should allow more time for debate.

Cape town At last, the South African government seems to have agreed to tackle the AIDS pandemic in a whole-hearted manner. Admitting that \u201cwe all know that HIV and AIDS are among us\u201d, deputy President Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka appealed to South Africans on 1 December, World AIDS Day, to \u201cjoin hands to save our people, in the same way that we joined hands to fight and defeat apartheid\u201d. At a rally in Nelspruit, the capital of South Africa's Mpumalanga province, Mlambo-Ngcuka released a draft of the government's plan. The document contains only two targets: to halve the rate of infection, and to make antiretroviral treatment available to 80% of those who require it, both by the end of 2011. Mlambo-Ngcuka also declared her intention to restructure the South African National AIDS Council to include representatives from the private sector, trade unions and non-governmental organizations. No information is available on how the targets will be met \u2014 the government plans to finalize the details by March. But the developments have been greeted with cautious optimism by AIDS activists and practitioners. \u201cIf enough funds are provided, and if human resources problems \u2014 particularly relating to nurses \u2014 can be resolved, treatment targets are achievable,\u201d says economist Nicoli Nattrass, director of the AIDS and Society research unit at the University of Cape Town. South Africa has previously taken an ambivalent approach to HIV. President Thabo Mbeki has maintained a stony silence on the issue, and with no coordinated national strategy to provide antiretroviral drugs to patients, access to treatment has been patchy at best. Many see the Worlds AIDS Congress, held in Toronto, Canada, in August, as a turning point. The government was embarrassed by health minister Manto Tshabalala-Msimang, who used it to extol the virtues of garlic, lemon and beetroot in the fight against AIDS. Mlambo-Ngcuka, who many see as a possible successor to Mbeki, quickly assumed responsibility for government policy on the issue. She faces a tough task. A report released last week by the Actuarial Society of South Africa (ASSA) stated that 1.8 million people have died of AIDS in South Africa since the early 1990s. Between 800,000 and 1 million people need antiretroviral treatment but only a third of them \u2014 and a tenth of children \u2014 are getting it. Slowing down rates of infection might be even more difficult. The ASSA estimates that half a million people became infected this year, down from 650,000 in 1998. But the signs are promising. In 2005, 1.7 million people used government counselling and testing services, and this year the number of people treated for HIV nearly doubled. Last week the deputy health minister, Nozizwe Madlala-Routledge, became the first government minister to publicly undergo an AIDS test. Reprints and Permissions"},

New York Can brain scans of a racist, liar or psychopath accurately tell whether that person will persecute, fib or kill? No, say experts in the ethics of neuroscience, who are increasingly concerned that such images will be used to make dangerous legal or social judgements about people's behaviour. They say it is time for scientists, lawyers and philosophers to speak up about the limitations of such techniques. \u201cLawyers want to know 'Can I put somebody on the scanner and tell if they're racist?'\u201d says Elizabeth Phelps, a psychologist and neuroscientist at New York University who has studied the brain's response to race. \u201cWe as a group of scientists have to be able to say that we can't make that distinction.\u201d Phelps spoke at a panel discussion on the emerging field of neuroethics held in New York last week. Neuroscientists increasingly use technologies such as functional magnetic resonance imaging to see how blood flow in the brain changes when we see pictures, recall memories or make decisions. But these images are prompting concerns about how they might be over-interpreted or misused (see  Nature   435 , 254\u2013255; 2005). Outside the lab, neuroimaging is being touted as a way to detect lies (see  Nature   437 , 457; 2005) or to predict what shoppers might buy. There have been suggestions that brain imaging could be used to screen police officers for race bias by showing them faces of particular ethnicities. But most scientists say that studies of behavioural or physical responses \u2014 for example, a person's reaction to different races in real life \u2014 should trump imaging every time. That's because interpreting brain scans, and correlating them to actions, is inaccurate at best. All we can really gain from such studies is a more nuanced understanding of behaviour, says Phelps. The persuasiveness of brain scans has already drawn them into the court-room. In a landmark case in the US Supreme Court in March 2005, several leading scientific groups, including the American Medical Association, the American Psychiatric Association and the National Mental Health Association, filed briefs to support the premise that teenagers are less rational than adults. The data included a brain-imaging study showing that the prefrontal cortex, which governs impulse control and reasoning, develops late in adolescence (see  Nature   442 , 865\u2013867; 2006), and could explain some irrational aspects of teenage behaviour. Many groups thought this study could help rule against the death penalty. But although the court ruled against the death penalty for those younger than 18, it chose not to cite the brain-imaging study, relying instead on behavioural studies that showed adolescents are more impulsive, more vulnerable to peer pressure and more affected by stress. Stephen Morse, a professor of law and psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, thinks it was a wise decision.Although the imaging study helped to explain why a particular group might have different behaviour, the behaviour itself is more important than the changes seen in the brain, he says. Citing the study would have given it too much credibility, he adds, and opened the door for further claims that imaging predicts behaviour. \u201cThe legal and moral claims being made [from imaging studies involving very few people] are far too extensive.\u201d Morse is a founding member of the Neuroethics Society, set up earlier this year by a group of lawyers, philosophers and scientists to address issues raised by the use of brain scans and other future applications of neuroscience (see  Nature   441 , 907; doi:10.1038/441907a2006 ). Many neuroscientists are concerned about inappropriate applications of their research, but they rarely come out and say so. Scientists should speak up, but it will also take lawyers and sociologists to lay out the concerns, says Morse. \u201cWe need scientists to say what they know and what they don't know,\u201d he says. \u201cBut the implications are not a science question, they are a moral question, a social question, a legal question.\u201d \n                     Neuroethics needed \n                   \n                     Ethicists urge caution over emotive power of brain scans \n                   \n                     Lure of lie detectors spooks ethicists \n                   \n                     International Humanist and Ethical Union \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Bonny island, Nigeria Oil and gas companies have set up a three-year project to tackle the rapid spread of AIDS around one of the largest facilities in the Niger delta. King Edward XI of Bonny Island announced the partnership on 1 December, World AIDS Day, saying he hoped it would \u201crouse the community into action\u201d and lead to free treatment for people living with HIV/AIDS. The island, with a population of about 150,000, houses a vast US$15-billion liquefied natural-gas plant. The Bonny Island initiative, named Ibani-se, is initially being supported by Nigeria Liquified Natural Gas, Shell and Exxon-Mobil to address the welfare of the local community. The companies spent $600,000 to start it this year and are expected to put in another $1.4 million in 2007. The initiative is led by Donald de Korte, a physician and consultant to drug company Merck, who used to run the African Comprehensive HIV/AIDS Partnerships in Botswana. The plan is to consult local people and establish Ibani-se as a community-based project funded not just by oil and gas companies but by sources such as the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. The challenges of operating in the lawless and volatile delta mean little has been done so far to confront the menace of AIDS. High infection rates are fuelled, researchers suspect, by rampant sexual interaction between oil workers, other migrant labour and the many sex workers who surround the oil and gas facilities. Project officials chose Bonny Island because it provides a distinct entity for monitoring and treatment, and is stably governed by the king. It is one of the few places in the delta secure enough for such an initiative to work. A survey of 800 households suggests that the AIDS prevalence on the island is around 8%, almost twice the national average. The project plans to counsel and test 30,000 people for HIV over three years, and offer antiretroviral treatment at Bonny General Hospital, the island's dilapidated medical facility. \u201cThe first priority is to equip and staff the hospital properly,\u201d says Douglas Pepple, its senior physician. The project's organizers hope to have 50 patients on antiretroviral drugs by the end of 2007, and 800 (a quarter of those estimated to need them) by the end of 2009. Reprints and Permissions"},

The main US ship for Arctic research is patching together plans for next year's cruises under the shadow of safety concerns, after its marine science officer and a crewman died while diving under the ice. The US Coast Guard icebreaker  Healy  is scheduled to begin operations in April, as part of International Polar Year, in which hundreds of scientists from at least 60 countries will launch projects at the poles. But US agencies are experiencing considerable challenges, including replacing two ageing icebreakers, securing a crucial helicopter service, and training icebreaker crews for scientific missions. And in a telephone conference on 16 November, Coast Guard officers told US research agencies that divers may not be available for the 200 days of scientific operations that the  Healy  is scheduled to complete. A Navy-certified dive team typically supports researchers aboard the 128-metre icebreaker, helping with equipment and operations in the water. On 17 August, while stopped in pack ice about 800 kilometres north of Barrow, Alaska, marine science officer Jessica Hill and a mate, Steven Duque, died while on a short dive under the ice. Hill, a marine biologist who was also the ship's dive officer, was conducting a 'familiarization' dive for the less-experienced Duque. When the divers ran into difficulties, crew members pulled them out of the water via lifeline ropes. Resuscitation was unsuccessful and the divers were pronounced dead. The  Healy  steamed to Alaska, where Coast Guard officials relieved the captain, suspended all dives, and cancelled the ship's two remaining research cruises for 2006. A month-long cruise led by scientists at the University of New Hampshire in Durham, who are mapping the continental shelf to redraw the US economic zone, was delayed until next September. And a cruise to test an under-ice vehicle operated by researchers from Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Massachusetts was cancelled. The team will deploy the vehicle next summer without the benefit of a full test run. \u201cWe were disappointed,\u201d says Simon Stephenson, director of the Arctic science division of the US National Science Foundation (NSF). \u201cBut this was a safety issue; there was concern about the crew functioning properly.\u201d Coast Guard investigations into the deaths are due to be completed by February 2007. Earlier this month, military officials released autopsy reports to the families in Florida. Hill, 30, died of asphyxiation, with lung trauma from a likely unconscious ascent from about 60 metres down. The report says that both divers' air tanks were empty. \u201cNothing will bring her back, but I would like to know what happened,\u201d says retired microbiologist William Hill, the woman's father. The tragedy adds to difficulties already being experienced by the US fleet of four icebreakers. In September, the Government Accountability Office reported on the inadequacies of the ageing ships, and a National Academy of Sciences panel called for the replacement of two of them ( Polar Sea  and  Polar Star ). The  Healy  is the newest of the fleet, commissioned in 2000, and the only one primarily devoted to scientific missions. But there have been difficulties with the  Healy 's Coast Guard crew having sufficient technical experience to support researchers on board. In recent years, the NSF has had to contract out various services, including the handling of ocean-floor cores (to Oregon State University) and key depth and temperature data (to Scripps Institution of Oceanography). Last summer the agency also had to pay for a contract helicopter service for some cruises, doubling costs to US$600,000, because Coast Guard helicopter engines were being replaced. Stephenson is now aiming for a more coordinated approach. Next year, he says, the NSF will issue a request for proposals in which one institution would provide scientific support personnel for the  Healy . The contract, worth around $1 million, is to be in place for 2008. But Stephenson is still aiming to fill a month-long gap in June, when no team is scheduled to use the ship. \u201cIt's ironic this is happening [during International Polar Year],\u201d he admits. \u201cBut I predict there will be too much demand in 2008.\u201d \n                     Archaeology: The coast road \n                   \n                     USCGC Healy website \n                   \n                     US Coast Guard icebreakers \n                   \n                     International Polar Year \n                   \n                     Healy expedition April 2007 \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

The origins of the small collection of bones that will soon travel from London's Natural History Museum (NHM) to Tasmania say much about why the journey has taken so long to come about \u2014 and is still so controversial. One skull comes from an unnamed Tasmanian aboriginal woman, shot by a white settler and later decapitated. The curatorial description for another set of remains notes coolly that: \u201cThere has been white settlement of Tasmania since 1802. The remnants of the blacks being removed from the island in 1831.\u201d Just a dozen or so Tasmanian aboriginal women survived the brutal colonization by British settlers, and only a handful of museums retain specimens of the now dead race. For scientists, those remains are a crucial illustration on a page in human history. But for modern Australians descended from the aborigines, they are stolen property. On 17 November the NHM trustees announced that, in this case at least, indigenous claims trump scientific value. The decision is a landmark in a process that has seen human remains repatriated to an increasing number of indigenous groups over the past 20 years. In the United States, a change in the law has allowed native Americans to request the return of cultural and biological artefacts since 1990. But the move by the NHM could mark a change in the process, as few remains have so far been repatriated to groups outside the country in which they are held. The museum has also unsettled scientists by assessing indigenous ownership using much looser criteria than other institutions have used. \u201cYou have to ask questions about the will of the Natural History Museum trustees to defend science,\u201d says Robert Foley, who studies human evolution at the University of Cambridge, UK. The NHM's decision is the first to be made since Britain passed legislation in 2004 that permits repatriation claims. Descendants of the aborigines, represented by the Tasmanian Aboriginal Centre, submitted a case for the return of the remains of 17 Tasmanians to an independent panel of experts asked by the museum to weigh the ethical and scientific sides of the argument. The four-member panel recommended repatriation; the museum's trustees agreed and announced the move immediately. The loss of the specimens is a blow to museum scientists. Rising sea levels cut Tasmania off from Australia some 12,000 years ago, isolating people there from the innovations, such as stone tools, that changed life on the rest of the continent. NHM researchers say that the Tasmanian remains are a crucial record of the region and a vital component in records of human variability. Very few Tasmanian remains exist in other museums, and those in Australia are often not accessible to scientists. The NHM will retain the remains for three months to sample DNA and run computerized tomography scans. Storing such scans reduces the loss caused by the repatriation, but researchers point out that as the remains are likely to be cremated, experimental techniques that arise in the future cannot be applied. New analytical techniques were behind important results on Neanderthal DNA published just last week, they point out (see  Nature   444 , 254; 2006). \u201cWho knows what kind of questions we could ask,\u201d says Daniel Lieberman, an anthropologist at Harvard University. Others worry that the NHM's decision puts at risk other foreign remains in its collection, which make up just under half of its 20,000 human specimens. The museum is already talking to the Australian government about the return of some 450 other aboriginal remains, and has also been approached by indigenous groups from New Zealand and the United States. Museums in Europe and the United States typically require such groups to prove a strong connection to the community from which the bones were removed. Yet the Tasmanian claim is based on a relatively loose connection, as the small number of aboriginal ancestors became part of other communities. Such a claim would not satisfy US law, say experts familiar with the process. It also seems to contradict UK guidelines, which call for descendancy to be proved. \u201cI find it bizarre,\u201d says one researcher familiar with the guidelines, who asked not to be named. \u201cThere is no evidence that [the Tasmanian Aboriginal Centre] is the appropriate body\u201d to receive these remains. But Richard Lane, the NHM's director of science, says the museum made the decision after considering how the descendants of the Tasmanian aborigines view their link with the remains. He says that aboriginal groups place a great deal of importance on cultural links with their ancestors. Western thinking emphasizes genealogical descendancy above such links, but Lane says it would be unethical to place European views above those of the aborigines. He adds that the advisory panel's guidelines, drawn up after considering the national guidelines, reflect this approach. \n                     Bone archives face prospect of dispersal \n                   \n                     Natural History Museum \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Other conservationists want governments to place more emphasis on curbing the trade in tiger parts and skins, which are in high demand in Tibet and China.

The UK government clearly aimed to make a statement about climate change last week. And it succeeded. At the Queen's official opening of parliament on 15 November, it promised legislation that will see the country's greenhouse-gas emissions slashed to 60% of 1990 levels by 2050. That is a level far beyond its carbon-reduction commitments under the Kyoto Protocol, and a longer-term programme of cuts than any other major polluting country has so far adopted. Is the British pledge as impressive as it sounds? The legislation has not yet been officially introduced into parliament \u2014 that will happen in the coming months when the government produces a draft bill. So, although the announcement is a powerful statement of intent, the details remain vague. \u201cHow the target is defined and set, and how progress is measured and reported, are fundamental issues that are still being considered,\u201d said a statement from the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, which is charged with drafting the legislation. Opposition politicians and environmentalists have also pointed out that although the far-reaching target is laudable, the plan isn't so tough in the short term. Critics have called for the plan to involve fixed annual cuts in emissions, rather than the five-yearly targets suggested by the government. There is optimism, however, that the target is achievable \u2014 if improvements in energy efficiency are combined with the development of low-carbon technologies. Unfortunately the same cannot be said of sorting out what should happen in the next phase of the Kyoto agreement. International talks in Nairobi, Kenya, last week were meant to address how to incorporate large developing economies such as China, India and Brazil into the treaty after 2012. On Friday, the summit's final day, the Kyoto nations decided to postpone the negotiation until 2008. \n                     Developing world concerned over climate fund \n                   \n                     Economic review counts costs of climate change \n                   \n                     Britain aims to take lead on aggressive carbon cuts \n                   \n                     Climate change in focus \n                   \n                     Regional climate change special \n                   \n                     Business news \n                   \n                     Earth and environment news \n                   \n                     Policy news \n                   \n                     Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs \n                   \n                     UN Framework Convention on Climate Change  \n                   \n                     Carbon Trust \n                   \n                     United Nations Nairobi 2006 conference \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Almut Graebsch and Quirin Schiermeier assess whether creationism is threatening science in Europe. Being a trained biologist doesn't stop Maciej Giertych from insisting that evolution is a falsified hypothesis 1 . The 70-year-old Polish member of the European parliament, who has a PhD in tree physiology, also wants to spread the word. In October, he organized a workshop for parliamentarians entitled \u201cTeaching evolution theory in Europe: is your child being indoctrinated in the classroom?\u201d Although the teaching of evolution has become a highly politicized and hotly discussed matter in the United States, such moves are rare in Europe, and Giertych's activities have so far met with little response in Strasbourg or Brussels. But a number of similar incidents over the past couple of years, in various countries, are raising fears among the scientific community that creationism may be on the rise in Europe. Last month, for example, it emerged that creationism is being taught at two schools in the German state of Hesse. The incident, albeit minor, has provoked debate in the country. The Christian view of creation should at least be discussed in science classes, argues Karin Wolf, Hesse's Christian Democrat education minister. But the Association of German Biologists warns of the dangers of blurring the division between science and religion. And in Britain in September, the prominent creationist group Truth in Science sent information packs to every UK secondary school. The material suggests intelligent design should be taught as an alternative to the theory of evolution, although the UK government's education department was quick to say that it does not endorse its use in science classes. In response, a group called the British Centre for Science Education has been formed to campaign against the teaching of creationism in schools. Meanwhile, British school leavers' knowledge about evolution is considered so poor, and creationist ideas so widespread, that the universities of Leeds and Leicester are planning to introduce remedial courses next year for first-year science students. Steve Jones, a geneticist at University College London who has lectured widely about evolution, is one of those concerned by the growing influence of creationist groups. \u201cI have talked about evolution in front of more than 100,000 British schoolchildren in the past 20 years \u2014 during most of that time I was never asked questions about creationism,\u201d he says. \u201cBut in the past couple of years, wherever I go I am asked about it.\u201d He ascribes the change largely to the activities of groups such as Truth in Science. But perhaps the most blatant attempt to ban evolution from the classrooms occurred in Italy in 2004. Letizia Moratti, then education minister, caused a public outcry when she removed the theory of evolution from the curricula of Italy's middle schools 2  on the grounds that teaching Darwin's theory of evolution can instil a materialist view of life in young minds. Following widespread protest, the education ministry partially reintroduced darwinism into school courses. A recent study by Observa Science in Society, a Vicenza-based body that promotes informed debate on scientific issues, shows that only 11% of Italians support the exclusion of darwinism from curricula. But almost two-thirds would prefer lessons to cover both evolutionary theory and the creationist view. \u201cItaly is no longer a completely secular country,\u201d says Telmo Pievani, a philosopher of science at the University of Milan II in Italy. \u201cWe are facing a dramatic and worrying cultural and political regression.\u201d In Russia, meanwhile, creationist societies are receiving strong support from the Protestant minority. Besides translating the writings of European and US creationists, Russian groups conduct their own 'creation research'. In Moscow, for example, the ARCTUR Research Geological Lab is looking for geological and geochemical proof of creationism. The society collaborates with creationists in the West and promotes its findings in several Russian and English-language creationist journals. Such examples illustrate the complexity of the issue in Europe compared with the United States. Whereas the US drive towards creationism comes mainly from Protestant fundamentalist groups, the European movement has diverse roots. \u201cThere is an aggressive anti-darwinism inspired by radical Islamic minorities in immigrant communities in Britain and France; there is a Catholic creationism growing in Poland; there is Protestant creationism in some schools in England,\u201d says Pievani. The Koran is less clear than the Bible on divine creation. But that does not mean Islam accepts evolution, and the influence of Islamic creationist groups in countries such as Britain and France is increasing. The movement is by far the strongest in Turkey, however, which is in negotiations to join the European Union. The main Muslim creationist organization, the Turkish Bilim ve Aras\u00b8tirma Vakfi, distributes creationist literature in Turkey and elsewhere that often consists of material translated from Christian fundamentalist groups, particularly the Institute for Creation Research, based in North Santee, California. Prominent US creationists are also frequently invited by the group to give talks. Jones has just returned from the Istanbul book fair, where he says many creationist publications were on sale, and proving extremely popular. \u201cCreationism is a major issue in Turkish politics; the debate is much more tense than in the United States,\u201d he says. \u201cAll biology textbooks now used in schools are creationist in tone.\u201d There is debate over the size of the threat posed to science in Europe by the various creationist movements. The creationists' main goal is to have their views included in school curricula. But, unlike in the United States, many pupils in European schools receive religious education anyway and are therefore familiar with the theme of divine creation. Some think this may steal the thunder of the creationist movement in Europe \u2014 why force creationism into science classes if it is already taught in religious education? Moreover, Europeans do seem to be more enlightened than Americans when it comes to evolution. According to a 2005 US study 3 , just 40% of Americans accepted the theory of evolution, down from 45% in 1985. In Europe, that figure has increased, from 65% in 1992 to 70% in 2005, although numbers vary widely across the region 4 . Others warn that scientists can't afford to be complacent. \u201cThe anti-evolution movement does undermine public understanding of science,\u201d argues Ulrich Kutschera, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Kassel in Germany and vice-president of the Association of German Biologists. \u201cIn Germany and other European countries, anti-evolutionists with different religious backgrounds promote their ideology via colourful web pages that are appealing to students and people without a scientific background. Perception of evolutionary biology, in particular, is seriously undermined by these activities.\u201d He suggests that biologists should devote more time to counteracting its spread by explaining their theories to the public. Jones says that, despite his dislike of creationism \u2014 \u201cit annoys and depresses me that intelligent students persist in holding irrational views\u201d \u2014 he doesn't think that such arguments are set to undermine science in countries such as Britain. \u201cBut I am not so optimistic about Turkey.\u201d \n                     Polish scientists fight creationism \n                   \n                     When science and theology meet \n                   \n                     Intelligent design: Who has designs on your students' minds? \n                   \n                     Designer scientific literature \n                   \n                     Axeing of website article sparks row at Max Planck \n                   \n                     Religion and Science in focus \n                   \n                     British Centre for Science Education \n                   \n                     Eurobarometer \n                   \n                     Truth in Science \n                   \n                     Studiengemeinschaft Wort und Wissen (in German) \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

This month sees the fifth anniversary of the Doha declaration, an international agreement signed by the world's trade ministers that was aimed at broadening poor countries' access to medicines. But in the intervening five years, the main provisions in the declaration have not been used and access to treatments remains dire. So activists are changing tactics. Instead of leaning on governments and corporations, as they have in the past, they are now pressuring universities to guarantee access to drugs and medical products invented on campus. This idea \u2014 labelled socially responsible technology transfer \u2014 has already notched up some key victories. For instance, in 2001, after student protests, external pressure and heavy media coverage, Yale University and Bristol-Myers Squibb agreed to an unprecedented arrangement. The company said it would allow companies in developing nations to produce a generic version of a key AIDS drug, d4T (stavudine), which had been invented at Yale and licensed to the company. And last year, the University of California, Berkeley, issued a royalty-free licence on a process invented by one of its scientists, Jay Keasling, in which engineered yeast churn out the malaria drug artemisinin (see  Nature   440 , 852\u2013853; 2006 doi:10.1038/440852b ). The deal was supported in part by grants from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, and was one of 15 that has been handled by a technology-transfer programme at Berkeley dedicated to socially responsible licensing. The concept of socially responsible technology transfer has also found a potentially influential political backer in US Senator Patrick Leahy (Democrat, Vermont), who is expected to head the powerful Committee on the Judiciary in the next Senate. In September, Leahy introduced a bill that would require federally funded research institutions to ensure that their drugs and novel medical devices are supplied cheaply to the developing world. But the movement now faces several difficult tests, and the next year could see the answer to a key question: can socially responsible technology transfer gain permanent traction? Its proponents say yes \u2014 and they are backed by a host of prominent supporters. On 14 November, a group of students called Universities Allied for Essential Medicines (UAEM) released a manifesto that it calls the Philadelphia Consensus Statement. This has been signed by some 400 scientists, lawyers, public-health specialists and students. The list boasts four Nobel laureates, as well as Paul Farmer, founder of the medical justice group Partners in Health; and the Justice Edwin Cameron, the first high-ranking South African leader to disclose that he had HIV. The consensus statement calls on universities to promote equal access to the fruits of their research, to step up work on diseases that disproportionately affect the poor, and to measure research success according to its impact on human welfare. The group has delivered its statement to an influential group of technology-transfer officers from prominent US universities. And last week, it submitted the statement to a World Health Organization working group that is mapping a more sustainable strategy to develop drugs for neglected diseases. \u201cUniversities have this lofty language in their mission statements about creating and disseminating knowledge for the public good,\u201d says Dave Chokshi, a medical student at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia and a member of UAEM. \u201cIf they want that to mean anything, they have to take up these types of issues and show it's not just lip-service.\u201d But technology-transfer officers at universities say that it's not always easy to do the right thing. Some argue that the socially responsible technology-transfer movement doesn't understand the pressures involved in marketing university inventions to potential investors. In a deal announced this June, for instance, Yale licensed a new AIDS drug, Ed4T, to a Japanese company called Oncolys BioPharma. Ed4T is chemically very similar to d4T. But UAEM has criticized the deal, alleging that the licence doesn't do enough to secure access to the drug for the poor. The students claim that Yale seems to have reversed the course it set with the 2001 d4T agreement. The Clinton Foundation HIV/AIDS Initiative, based in New York, has also questioned Yale about the terms of the Ed4T licence. In a response to the foundation on 26 October, Yale president, Richard Levin, outlined steps that the university has taken to promote access to Ed4T. For instance, the university does not plan to enforce its patents on the drug in some low-income countries, such as India. And it will not grant licences for companies that want to sell the drug in these nations, adds John Soderstrom, managing director of Yale's office of cooperative research. Soderstrom says that Yale would have liked to do more, but that its hands were tied in this instance, adding that Ed4T was \u201ca very difficult case\u201d. \u201cWe marketed this for years before anyone showed any interest in it,\u201d Soderstrom says. In fact, he argues, Yale is lucky if it can get one company interested in an invention \u2014 and that limits the university's ability to negotiate terms that ensure broad access to drugs. \u201cWe were very excited because the company was willing to make a commitment to develop the technology and bring it to the marketplace, but we clearly weren't able to get every single term and condition into the licence agreement that we would have liked,\u201d Soderstrom says. This is why Carol Mimura, head of Berkeley's socially responsible licensing programme, says the third plank of the Philadelphia Consensus Statement is so important. Universities must be open both to new types of arrangements, and to new ways of measuring success in partnership ventures, she says. Simply looking at the current metrics of deals done and dollars earned doesn't capture the full spectrum of benefits that universities reap from socially responsible technology transfer. \u201cIf you measure success in terms of social impact or awareness and you count things such as gifts, research collaborations, global impact and boost to your reputation, it changes your orientation,\u201d Mimura says. \u201cIf you measure success only by the amount of royalties and fees you bring in, then your licensing practices will reflect that.\u201d \n                     Production of the antimalarial drug precursor artemisinic acid in engineered yeast \n                   \n                     Are rich nations up for drug reform? \n                   \n                     Health priorities gain patent reprieve for developing countries \n                   \n                     Malaria web focus \n                   \n                     Malaria special \n                   \n                     Philadelphia Consensus Statement \n                   \n                     Yale ed4t deal \n                   \n                     WHO Panel \n                   \n                     Doha declaration \n                   \n                     Berkeley program web page \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

The tiny, elegant and undeniably ancient Rita Levi-Montalcini \u2014 Nobel laureate and, at 97, still active in her role as senator-for-life \u2014 thrust the plight of Italian research into the headlines last week. She pledged to vote against the new government's 2007 budget if last-minute cutbacks for science were not reversed. That small battle was won, and the bill passed through the first of the Italian parliament's two chambers on 18 November with a final budget for universities and research only slightly lower than that for this year. There is still much fighting to be done, but when the stringent 2007 budget \u2014 designed to reduce Italy's soaring deficit \u2014 is finally signed off in December, scientists are likely to see a significant increase in research project money, a decrease in funding for infrastructure, and a smaller-than-anticipated increase in new positions for young academics. This may disappoint those who had higher hopes for the avowedly research-friendly centre-left coalition government that took office in the summer. But behind the headlines, more fundamental changes to the research system have quietly taken place. Two key decrees were approved last week, which in the long run may serve the scientific community better than immediate cash injections. One decree creates an evaluation agency for universities and research, which should be established by the spring. Its first task will be to broadly grade universities on their performance in teaching and research, producing three or four groupings that the ministry for universities and research will eventually use to allocate funds. \u201cThe agency's aim is to gradually improve, not to judge,\u201d says Luciano Modica, the research ministry's undersecretary. Modica hopes the agency will also help to solve other problems in the Italian research system \u2014 such as recruitment. Rules alone won't stop dishonest hiring policies, says Modica, but universities that allow bad decisions to be made will now be stung by the evaluation system. The second decree radically changes selection procedures for presidents of research organizations. These were previously direct government appointments \u2014 former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi's centre-right administration appointed several research heads considered incompetent by much of the scientific community (see  Nature   440 , 264\u2013265; 2006). Now independent committees will prepare shortlists of three candidates from which the research minister must pick. The new rules are already being put into practice for the Italian space agency, whose previous president, Sergio Vetrella, has resigned under pressure from the government. The rules are also expected to make it easier for the government to oust Fabio Pistella, president of the National Research Council, which runs more than 100 research institutes around Italy. Pistella has evaded attempts to transfer him to another post. Scientists have welcomed the reforms. They will help a lot, even if funding levels for 2007 are modest, says physicist Giorgio Parisi of La Sapienza University in Rome. But after five successive years of cuts, he says it will be \u201cdisappointing\u201d not to maintain at least 2006 levels.

Monsoon rains in Asia are behaving ever more strangely, often with catastrophic effects, an Indian official has told climate experts at the Earth System Science Partnership (ESSP) meeting in Beijing.  The monsoons always have the capacity to cause flooding, and often do. But when the rains strike at an odd time or in the wrong place they can be devastating. A late onset of monsoon rains in the Marathwada region of Maharashtra state this year caused a mix-up that resulted in 400 drought-struck villages being wiped away by floodwaters, along with more than 700 deaths, Nagpur legislative member Devendra Fadnavis told conference-goers on 11 November.  A series of dams in that area catch monsoon rains and save the water for the remainder of the year. This June the reservoirs were filled to 80% of their capacity with rains, said Fadnavis, and many assumed that the monsoon, which historically has struck in late June, had done its job and delivered its water for the year. Despite drought conditions downstream, the water was saved for the anticipated even dryer months ahead.  But there has been a trend over the past five years for the monsoon in this area to be about a month late, said Fadnavis, who blames an unknown effect of climate change for the persistent delay. When the heaviest rains arrived in August 2006, officials were forced to let loose vast quantities of water to prevent the dams from being damaged, he says. The resulting floods caused massive destruction and death in villages downstream.  Those in charge of water distribution should be more aware of changing climate patterns, Fadnavis argued. \"They must understand that this is a new ecological order. The planning should be shifted.\" If officials had anticipated further rain later in the summer, he added, they could have slowly let June's water out, alleviating drought and preventing future flooding.   \n              Wrong place, wrong time  \n            Climate researchers themselves remain unsure whether there really is a long-term trend of delay in the monsoons. \"I am unconvinced,\" responded Congbin Fu, a meteorologist and head of a new ESSP project looking at environmental change in Monsoon Asia launched at this week's meeting. \"This [delay] would be very important \u2014 it needs to be verified,\" he added.  If there is a trend, notes Ahsan Uddin Ahmed, an atmospheric chemist who works with the Bangladesh Unnayan Parishad and is involved with the Monsoon Asia project, it cannot yet be pinned on climate change. \"It's impossible to tell. You need decades of data,\" he says.  But such stories, he adds, are not uncommon. One pattern that is predicted by monsoon models is that future rains are likely to arrive in shorter, more intense bursts \u2014 as they did in Maharashtra last year, when a record single-day rainfall of 944 millimetres on 26 July killed more than 1,000 people in Mumbai.   \"There's no agreement in the models as to when the monsoons will happen, but they all say there will be sharp, high-intensity rains. And that means more floods,\" says Ahmed. India is also expecting more rain overall: 7-11% more rainfall is expected annually by the end of the century, boosting the occurrence of severe floods from once in 20 years to once every 8.3 years, he says.  Other studies indicate that winter monsoons seem to be abating, adds Fu, and the frequency of extreme events \u2014 including both floods and droughts \u2014 are expected to increase.  \"Weird things are happening. Certainly monsoons are hitting in the wrong place at the wrong time, and officials aren't ready for it,\" says Fadnavis. \"It's a major gamble with livelihood.\"  \n             Visit our  \n             \n                 newsblog \n               \n              to read and post comments about this story. \n           \n                   ESSP meeting \n                 \n                   BBC weather: the Asian Monsoon \n                 \n                   Monsoon Asia Integrated Regional Study \n                 Reprints and Permissions"},

Two research teams publish the first detailed glimpse of a Neanderthal genome this week, starting the race to unravel the genetic structure of modern man's closest relative. Articles in  Nature 1  and  Science 2  offer complementary yet contrasting views of nuclear DNA extracted from the same bone of a Neanderthal male who lived 38,000 years ago, found in a Croatian cave. Both groups, which collaborated in part on their projects, say they need to sequence far more of the Neanderthal's DNA to answer key questions. But for now, the studies find roughly similar timescales for when Neanderthals and modern humans,  Homo sapiens , diverged from each other in the course of evolution. Given recent advances in DNA sequencing, a full Neanderthal genome could be sequenced within two years, the  Nature  authors say. \u201cThis is the golden age of ancient DNA work,\u201d says first author Richard Green, a postdoctoral researcher at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany. Neanderthals and  H. sapiens  roamed the same regions of Europe and western Asia until the Neanderthals went extinct 30,000 years ago. Both research groups now have genetic estimates for when the two species shared a most recent common ancestor. In the  Science  article, team leader Edward Rubin places that event at roughly 706,000 years ago. In  Nature , the Max Planck group \u2014 headed by palaeogeneticist Svante P\u00e4\u00e4bo \u2014 write that human and Neanderthal sequences diverged roughly 516,000 years ago. Within the large margins of error typical of such analyses, these conclusions could turn out to be the same. The  Nature  paper also takes a stab at estimating the size of the ancestral population that gave rise to humans and Neanderthals: roughly 3,000 individuals. The gene studies may also shed light on a long-contested idea in palaeoanthropology: that Neanderthals and  H. sapiens  may have interbred. Last week, another research team proposed that modern humans acquired a version of the  microcephalin  gene \u2014 which regulates brain size \u2014 through interbreeding with another  Homo  species that has since gone extinct, possibly the Neanderthals 3 . Fossils \u2014 such as a 30,000-year-old skull from a Romanian cave 4  \u2014 have also been put forward as evidence of hybridization between the two species. The latest data suggest that some interbreeding may have taken place on a limited scale, says P\u00e4\u00e4bo. \u201cOne possibility is gene flow from modern human to Neanderthal,\u201d he says. But the data could also be explained if the studied Neanderthal sample was contaminated with modern human DNA. \u201cWe have contamination under control,\u201d P\u00e4\u00e4bo says. As for the other group, \u201cwe don't see any evidence of interbreeding\u201d, says Rubin, director of the Joint Genome Institute (JGI) in Walnut Creek, California. \u201cBut we could have missed it because we don't have enough Neanderthal sequence yet.\u201d Rubin's group reports analysis of about 65,000 base pairs. The  Nature  article reports about 1 million. The genomes of modern humans and Neanderthals each have about 3 billion base pairs. \u201cThese studies show you can do large-scale sequencing of Neanderthal DNA,\u201d says Jeffrey Wall, a computational biologist at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles who was not involved in either study. \u201cThere are some unresolved issues,\u201d he says. \u201cIn the end, the questions will be answered to everyone's satisfaction.\u201d Both groups agree that less than 0.5% of the two species' genomes are different. But the teams largely used different sequencing methods. The JGI team opted for a traditional bacterial, or Sanger, method to replicate Neanderthal DNA. The Max Planck team used a newer, and faster, sequencing system 5 . Both groups are pumping new sequences into publicly accessible databases. Nearly 5 million base pairs are already available. By spring, P\u00e4\u00e4bo expects to have about 1% of the Neanderthal genome completed. Rubin is now developing methods to target specific genes in the regions of the genome that are different in Neanderthals and modern humans. This approach, he says, allows one \u201cto reach in and fish out DNA for analysis for different traits\u201d. One of the first fishing trips will be for a gene called  FOXP2 , which in  H. sapiens  is linked to speech and language. Many animals have the gene, but the human version has distinct differences from that of the chimpanzee 6 . Such genetic excursions will need more Neanderthal individuals for a truly representative picture of the differences between the species. Palaeoanthropologists and geneticists are now teaming up to acquire more bone, from more caves. Eventually, genetics and palaeoanthropology will intertwine, predicts James Noonan, a JGI postdoc and first author on the  Science  article. \u201cHow biological features are encoded in the genome,\u201d he says, \u201cwill be correlated with what is seen in specimens.\u201d \n                     Did Neanderthals and modern humans get it together? \n                   \n                     Palaeoanthropology: Decoding our cousins \n                   \n                     Neanderthal DNA yields to genome foray \n                   \n                     Neanderthal DNA video \n                   \n                     Neanderthal DNA web focus \n                   \n                     Human Genome Collection \n                   \n                     Chimpanzee Genome web focus \n                   \n                     Chimp Genome special \n                   \n                     Joint Genome Institute \n                   \n                     Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology \n                   \n                     PloS paper, Ancestral Structure in Human Populations \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

But the same message raised eyebrows on the other side of the Atlantic last week, when a UK parliament report suggested that politicians there also pick and choose scientific results that best suit their policies. Britain's three successive Labour governments have made much of their desire to integrate research into policy-making; phrases such as \u201cevidence-based policy\u201d have become buzzwords for ministers. Science minister David Sainsbury, who left his position last week after eight years, also won the respect of researchers (see  page 244 ). But the latest report from the House of Commons Select Committee on Science and Technology tarnishes that happy image. The cross-party group of 11 MPs takes ministers to task for labelling policies \u201cevidence-based\u201d when no relevant research exists, and criticizes the civil service for its poor interpretation of research results. Perhaps most worrying, concludes Phil Willis, the Liberal Democrat member who chairs the committee, is the fact that government-commissioned studies regularly go unpublished when they conflict with a department's policy. The report's most dramatic examples came from Tim Hope, a criminologist at the University of Keele, whom the Home Office commissioned to evaluate an initiative on reducing burglary. Hope told the committee that the Home Office ignored a result showing an increase in crime rates in one area, and focused solely on a second result that showed a drop in offences. The Home Office did not return  Nature 's request for comment. Willis says that this and other examples \u2014 such as a 2005 anti-obesity drive developed in the absence of any evidence that it would work \u2014 show that the government lacks the academic ideal that all results must be aired, regardless of whether they fall as desired. \u201cIt's a level of scientific incompetence,\u201d he says. \u201cThere is not the culture of using scientific evidence and research in the way the scientific community would understand it.\u201d The report recommends that the government should ensure that every department has its own chief science adviser, and should also establish a government scientific service charged with bringing scientists into government and securing proper career paths for them. That is a laudable but old idea, notes Peter Cotgreave, director of the London-based lobby group the Campaign for Science and Engineering; a similar recommendation was made more than seven years ago, yet remains to be implemented. The government is likely to respond to the current proposals in the next few months. The report also suggests that peer review by outside bodies, such as learned societies, could assess the degree to which the government's policies are based on evidence. The government may, however, baulk at the thought of having an outside body audit its performance. Some science-policy experts are also sceptical about the idea: \u201cThis would replace judgements currently being made by officials subject to democratic accountability with judgements made by those outside the process,\u201d points out Roger Pielke Jr of the University of Colorado, Boulder. Whatever the difficulties in Britain, political interference in science policy is far greater in the United States, says Willis. For instance, it is widely thought that David King, the UK chief science adviser, would be able to speak out if government science policy diverged sharply from the evidence, whereas few would expect such independence of US presidential science adviser John Marburger. But during King's six years in office, government policy and scientific thinking on high-profile issues such as climate change have not diverged substantially. An interesting test of his independence, and the government's commitment to evidence-based policy, will occur when they do. \n                     Is US hurricane report being quashed? \n                   \n                     Has NASA's press office gone too far? \n                   \n                     Bush accused of trying to foist favourites on health agency \n                   \n                     Bush administration dismisses allegations of scientific bias \n                   \n                     Bush accused of power abuse over science \n                   \n                     Science and Technology Committee report \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},
{"file_id": "444248a", "url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/444248a", "year": 2006, "authors": [], "parsed_as_year": "2006_or_before", "body": "Both sides in a US pollution dispute claim that science is on their side. Emma Marris explains how environmental laws have forced them into this position. Last month, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) made a ruling on air pollution that contradicts the recommendations of its own staff scientists and a panel of external experts. Many groups, from the National Resources Defense Council to the American Lung Association, are protesting loudly. Both the protesters and the EPA claim that science supports their case, but neither side is really right. All parties insist that concern for human health is the only factor influencing their decision. But in fact they include different external factors, such as cost, in reaching different figures for the acceptable level of pollution. At issue here are small particles found in the air, often the product of combustion in a power plant or car. Formally called 'particulate matter', they are more generally known as soot. When breathed in, the particles inflame the lung tissue, and can lead to obstruction of the airways, and heart and lung disease. Periodically, the EPA comes up with acceptable annual and 24-hour exposure levels for particles smaller than 2.5 micrometres across (fine particles) and for particles smaller than 10 micrometres (coarse particles). Many countries and the European Union (EU) regulate coarse but not fine particles (see  'Dirty cities' ). The EU has set targets for coarse particles that \u2014 assuming that fine particles make up about half to three-quarters of the coarse ones \u2014 mean that fine particles would be regulated at around 10\u201314 micrograms per cubic metre annually by 2010. In the United States, the annual standard for fine particles was set for the first time in 1997 at 15 micrograms per cubic metre. This year, when the EPA was set to reconsider the limit, many wanted it lowered. But when the rules were announced on 17 October, it wasn't. Public-health experts consider this standard to be the most important \u2014 the smaller the particle, the deeper it gets into the lungs, and long-term exposure accounts for more deaths than short-term peaks. At least two large, well-respected epidemiological studies have documented the phenomenon in various cities and are cited extensively by both sides in making the case for different levels of regulation 1 . Arden Pope, an environmental epidemiologist at Brigham Young University in Utah, was involved in both studies. He says there is no evidence that it is safe to breathe any level of particulate. The relationship between particulate concentration and illness or death is more or less linear: the worse the air, the worse your health. The studies suggest that for every additional microgram of fine particulate in the air, between 0.6% and 1.6% more people will die every year \u2014 that's a few tens of thousands of deaths a year in the United States. Science on its own does not provide an obvious standard \u2014 pick any number, and a level set below it will produce fewer deaths \u2014 but a number must nonetheless be chosen. \u201cThere is no threshold at which some sensitive group is not harmed,\u201d says Pope. \u201cThe judgement then becomes: is there some level at which we quit trying to go lower? Then it becomes a policy judgement.\u201d \n               Finding a level \n             That judgement is made by EPA administrator Stephen Johnson. As part of the process, agency scientists pull together the available science and put some values on the table for discussion. An external panel of experts reviews this and makes recommendations: in this instance, to lower the annual standard to 14 micrograms per cubic metre. But in the end, Johnson maintained the level at 15 micrograms. According to the final ruling, Johnson gave more weight to uncertainties in the data at lower exposure levels, and based the long-term standards on long-term studies, instead of also including some related data from short-term studies. Interested parties have until 17 December to file a complaint, or a lawsuit. The panel of external experts was livid. \u201cWe took our tests very seriously and came up with a recommendation that the administrator didn't take,\u201d says Rogene Henderson, head of the panel and an air-pollution expert at the Lovelace Respiratory Research Institute in Albuquerque, New Mexico. \u201cMy concern is that the administrator chose not to take our advice, but other people's.\u201d Some critics charge that in not lowering the standards, Johnson went along with the administration of President George W. Bush, who has close ties to powerful business interests in the oil and gas industry. The EPA estimates that it would cost an additional $2.5 billion to clean the air to 14 micrograms per cubic metre, instead of 15, by 2020. But the same analysis also suggests that lowering the standard to 14 micrograms per cubic metre would save the economy an additional $10 billion in health and visibility-related costs. Many also charge that Johnson's decision violated the Clean Air Act, which says the administrator must set levels \u201crequisite to protect the public health with an adequate margin of safety\u201d. This vague phrase has been interpreted by Congress and the courts to mean that the EPA must protect the public's health without considering other factors, such as cost. The law does not say how many deaths are acceptable. Many pollutants other than soot, including some carcinogens, have a linear relationship between dose and health, so considering health alone would seem to demand that the agency set for all pollutants the politically and practically impossible standard of zero. David Schoenbrod, professor of environmental law at New York Law School, argues that Congress knew about this problem in the wording of the act when it was passed in 1970. In a recent article 2  he quotes the act's sponsor, Senator Edmund Muskie, as saying in 1977: \u201cOur public health scientists and doctors have told us that there is no threshold, that any air pollution is harmful. The Clean Air Act is based on the assumption, although we knew at the time it was inaccurate, that there is a threshold.\u201d Congress passed the act anyway, Schoenbrod contends, so that it could make perfect decisions about banishing harm and let the EPA worry about the inevitable compromises. \u201cThe EPA, as a practical matter, must decide exactly how much health risk to tolerate,\u201d he says. \u201cThe EPA weighs health risks against cost.\u201d Of course, the EPA cannot legally admit to doing this. Bill Wehrum, the agency's acting assistant administrator for air and radiation, says the new regulations were based only on science. But in that case, why not bow to the wishes of the staff scientists and lower the regulatory level? \u201cWe give absolute deference to what the science says, but reasonable minds can differ,\u201d Wehrum says. Wehrum also points to a Supreme Court case in 2000, in which the court supported the idea that air-quality standards should be set \u201cat the level that is 'requisite' \u2014 that is, not higher or lower than necessary\u201d. In that case, the EPA was being sued by a group of industries who argued that the annual fine-particulate level was set too low. This year, any potential lawsuit is likely to come from the health and environmental groups, saying it is set too high. The particulate standard they are suing over is, of course, the same. \n               Political decision \n             Whereas the EPA's external experts wanted the level to be lowered to 14 micrograms per cubic metre, the American Lung Association plumped for a safe level of 12. But the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends setting the limit even lower, at 10 micrograms. The association isn't saying it is willing to accept 50,000 more deaths each year than the WHO; rather, it supports the level of 12 micrograms on political grounds, as the EPA was never willing to consider 10 micrograms per cubic metre. Deborah Shprentz, a consultant to the association, says various analyses support a level of 12 micrograms per cubic metre, and fumes that \u201cthe EPA did not provide a robust scientific justification for leaving the standard at the current level. It seems like a betrayal of trust\u201d. The New York Times  gave its 14 October editorial on this matter the title \u201cScience Ignored, Again\u201d, but this might more properly be \u201cScientists Ignored, Again\u201d, as it was scientists' policy wishes, rather than scientific facts, that were disregarded. Any decision about what standard to set that considered just health would slide right down the linear relationship to zero. Sixteen years ago, in a National Academies report 3  on environmental decision-making, Boston University political-science professor Shep Melnick summed up what he called a uniquely American phenomenon: \u201cThe widespread hostility to the use of benefit\u2013cost and risk assessment analysis,\u201d he wrote, \u201cis based on an absolutist health-only position that virtually no one is willing to embrace in the real world. To put it more bluntly, almost no one really believes what many informed people emphatically maintain in public.\u201d \n                     Climate in court \n                   \n                     Safe and sound? \n                   \n                     Clear skies end global dimming \n                   \n                     Europe is 'failing to clean up its air' \n                   \n                     EPA on particulate matter \n                   \n                     Clean Air Science Advisory Committee \n                   \n                     Clean Air Watch press release \n                   \n                     American Lung Association press release \n                   \n                     The Clean Air Act \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

China has covered up outbreaks of SARS and avian influenza, and baulked at sharing samples and data with the international community. But last week, China's candidate for director-general of the World Health Organization (WHO), Margaret Chan, won a landslide victory in the election to replace South Korea's Lee Jong-wook, who died in May. Chan's election might herald greater Chinese openness and involvement in global health. Many are watching to see if, on taking office in January, she is as independent of her sponsors as she has promised. She has made women and Africa her priorities. The WHO faces a crisis of identity and purpose. The organization used to be the only global-health show in town, but the past decade has seen a series of new players emerge. The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria has a bigger budget than the WHO's US$1.7 billion, and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation spent almost $1 billion last year supporting global health. And nearly 100 public\u2013private health partnerships have sprung up, for example to develop drugs and vaccines for malaria and leishmaniasis. In fact, the presence of more organizations spending more money gives the WHO a chance to reinvent itself. For all its bureaucratic rigidity, it remains the only agency plugged into health ministries worldwide, with staff in almost every country, and the capacity to bring together the world's top scientists to tackle a particular problem. In principle, it is well-placed to help integrate the newer initiatives. In her manifesto, Chan endorsed such a shift in the WHO's focus. She is also apparently open to change: she recently led a review panel that concluded that the Tropical Disease Research programme sponsored by the WHO, the United Nations and the World Bank needs to be rethought. Yet Chan's victory surprised even some of her colleagues, who say that her track record, latterly with the WHO's programmes on communicable diseases and pandemic influenza, is more as a diplomat than a leader. \u201cShe is untested on the technical and political side,\u201d says Richard Horton, editor of  The Lancet , which backed another candidate. \u201cOne of her first tests will be who she brings in: she needs a team that fills the gaps in her own experience.\u201d On the eve of the election, China hosted a summit of African heads of state, and announced more than US$10 billion in aid for trade, health and agricultural development. Besides China, the United States backed her bid. Her 12 rivals included Bernard Kouchner, former French health minister and founder of M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res. Chan campaigned on her \u201coutstanding leadership\u201d as director of health in Hong Kong during the H5N1 avian flu outbreaks in 1997 and the 2003 SARS outbreak. But in 2004, a Hong Kong government inquiry sanctioned Chan for \u201cunsatisfactory performance\u201d in her handling of the SARS outbreak. And Hong Kong's cull of all chickens in late 1997 to stop the spread of H5N1 happened seven months after the first human H5N1 cases were reported. Most observers are giving Chan the benefit of the doubt. \u201cShe has travelled the rocky road of H5N1 and SARS and is well equipped to head the WHO in the many challenges and opportunities that lie ahead,\u201d says Ken Shortridge, a veteran of infectious-disease research in China, now retired in New Zealand. For Ellen t'Hoen, who leads M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res' campaign for access to essential medicines, Chan's priority must be to put health above national and business interests. For months, under US pressure, the WHO has sat on an advisory document on using trade rules to negotiate cheaper drugs. Chan would demonstrate her independence by publishing the document, says t'Hoen. \n                     WHO's next? \n                   \n                     WHO's in charge? \n                   \n                     Dreams of flu data \n                   \n                     WHO's Jong-Wook Lee? \n                   \n                     World Health Organization election page \n                   \n                     The Lancet  coverage of the election \n                   \n                     The Global Fund \n                   \n                     Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Leadership is also shifting in Washington DC, where the 7 November elections ushered in a complete changeover. Starting in January, Democrats will replace Republicans as the majority party in both houses of Congress. As such they will lead all committees, the working groups that regulate the details of laws in progress.  Nature 's  Emma Marris  spoke to one of the new power brokers in Congress: Representative Bart Gordon of Tennessee, who as ranking Democrat is in line to become chair of the House Committee on Science. She asked him how things will be different for science issues in Washington DC. \n               What is the main difference between you and your predecessor as chair of the science committee, Sherwood Boehlert? \n             Sherry's leaders in the House unfortunately limited what he could do, so Sherry couldn't be Sherry, if you know what I mean. I don't think that we are going to have that kind of heavy-handedness from the Democratic leadership. \n               What's going to happen with the president's American Competitiveness Initiative, to keep the country competitive in science and technology? \n             We will push legislation forward on that. I am very excited about it. I don't want this to be a Democratic or a Republican issue. I was asked by [incoming speaker of the House of Representatives] Nancy Pelosi to work on a competitiveness agenda, and this is a high priority for her. \n               One proposal that you have put forward is the creation of an Advanced Research Projects Agency for Energy, to work on technology that will reduce oil imports. Where is that going? \n             I don't think that the administration has an interest in it. They want to do things the way they want to do it and don't really want anybody else making recommendations. Energy independence is very important, I think it makes sense, and I am going to push very hard, in what I hope will be a bipartisan way, to get this accomplished. \n               There are noises from the administration that they are to release a sweeping energy plan. Are sweeping changes the way to go? \n             I hope that what you will see from the science committee is a lot of narrow-issue, bipartisan, good-government initiatives. My thought is that we could sit around here and talk round and round about energy independence for two, or three, or four years, and not get anything done. I don't want to hold up any good ideas we might have to put into a major bill if we can get them through on their own. Let's do smaller steps that we can get done. \n               Give me an example. \n             We are going to start with the education initiatives. There is a consensus that the United States has got to raise its capabilities in math and science. If we are going to have the jobs of the future, we need a higher-skilled workforce. The real problem is that approximately two-thirds of the math teachers in this country have neither a major nor a certification in that area. Compared with other countries, our students do worse the longer they are in school. The National Academies report lays out programmes to change this, and I'd like to see them put in place. \n               Does NASA have its priorities right? Do you feel that a realistic number has been put on the cost of sending humans to Mars? \n             I would like to see NASA do all that it is proposing and more. But we need to do a better job of oversight. I want to see if all of the numbers add up, and frankly I don't think they will. If they don't, we will have to take a hard look at priorities. I don't want to pass problems on to others. What we have seen with NASA is that prior administrators just keep on passing on problems. Someone needs to take oversight. \n               You've talked about censorship of scientists at agencies and politicization of science. Do you plan any hearings on that issue? \n             We hope that we can have some oversight hearings that are going to find out what was really going on. My goal is not to embarrass the administration but to shed some light on this problem so that people will be embarrassed to do it again.

Germany's strict laws governing human embryonic stem (ES) cells are no longer appropriate and need to be relaxed, says the country's main funding agency, the DFG. Backing its arguments with an 80-page report released on 10 November, the DFG argues that its previous support for a cautious approach is no longer valid. When the DFG speaks, politicians listen, and a parliamentary debate is now likely. But federal research minister Annette Schavan, a Christian Democrat, swiftly rejected any fundamental change to the rules, which forbid German researchers from working on human ES cell lines created after January 2002. The penalty for doing so, either in or outside Germany, is up to three years in prison. The DFG calls for three changes to the law. First, that the cut-off date be removed to give researchers access to the newer, better stem-cell lines used in other countries. Second, that human ES cell lines be allowed to be imported for clinical as well as research purposes. And third, that the threat of punishment for German researchers working abroad be lifted. Despite Schavan's rejection of the recommendations, there are splits on the issue for the first time in both her party and its sister party, the Christian Socialists, with some members calling for the cut-off date to be abolished. The Social Democrat coalition partner and the opposition Free Democrats are also split. In previous statements in 1999 and 2001, the DFG called for continuing public debate about the possible benefits and limitations of stem-cell research, and for further research into the potential of adult stem cells to provide an alternative source of cells capable of generating different types of tissue. Its current report acknowledges that the past five years of international research has not only cast doubt on the potential of adult stem cells, but has also made clinical applications of human ES cells foreseeable. German researchers are being left behind, the report says, and isolated further by a reluctance abroad to include German researchers on international stem-cell committees for fear they may be prosecuted at home. The outcome of the debate is uncertain, but politicians are broadly supportive of decriminalizing research on human ES cells by German scientists in countries where it is allowed. Responding to the DFG's report, Schavan also promised to launch \u201cin the near future\u201d a research programme for alternatives to human ES cells. But this just annoyed researchers more. \u201cThis top-down attempt to provide alternatives has been the ministry's line since the beginning, and has been shown not to work,\u201d says Oliver Br\u00fcstle, head of the Institute for Reconstructive Neurobiology at the University of Bonn, one of the DFG report's 12 authors. \u201cIt will be extremely dangerous to ignore international developments,\u201d he warns. \n                     A long week in stem-cell politics... \n                   \n                     Divergent local laws threaten to stifle Europe's stem-cell project \n                   \n                     Time to look to the future \n                   \n                     German parliament backs stem-cell research \n                   \n                     Stem cells in focus \n                   \n                     Making stem cells web focus \n                   \n                     Stem cells insight \n                   \n                     Stem cells insight blog \n                   \n                     Stem cells podcast \n                   \n                     25 years of embryonic stem cells \n                   \n                     German Research Foundation \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

At around 9:30 a.m. local time on 14 November, gunmen are reported to have abducted up to 150 academics, staff and visitors from an office of the higher-education ministry in the Karrada area of Baghdad. Little information on the institute targeted by the kidnappers was available at the time of writing, although sources in Baghdad said that the centre involved is a branch of the ministry that helps students and professors obtain placements in overseas universities. Some of the staff would have had a scientific background. The identity of the kidnappers isn't known, but those taken include both Shia and Sunni Muslims. According to some reports, the higher-education minister, Abed Theyab, immediately ordered the closure of all universities until security is improved. The timing may have been chosen to coincide with the Pugwash Conference on Science and World Affairs, held 11\u201315 November in Cairo, Egypt, according to Abbas Al-Hussaini, a civil engineer at the University of Westminster, UK. Al-Hussaini is also general secretary of the Iraqi Higher Education Organising Committee in London, which was set up in January 2004 to help reconstruct Iraq's research and higher-education system. The Pugwash organization, which campaigns against armed conflict, depends heavily on academics for its work in the Middle East, as well as other regions. Al-Hussaini believes that the kidnappings are not related to religious conflict between Sunnis and Shias, but are part of a plan to destablize Iraq coordinated by former intelligence officials loyal to Saddam Hussein. If the details are confirmed, the abduction will be the biggest single event in a steady campaign of attacks and assassinations against Iraqi academics during the bloody aftermath of Saddam Hussein's fall. More than 200 are thought to have been killed, and hundreds more have fled the country (see  Nature   441 , 1036\u20131037; 2006). Lack of investigation and prosecutions means that little is known about who carries out such attacks, and the motives are thought to vary. Some victims have certainly been targeted in revenge for past political allegiances, but many believe that there is also an organized campaign to eliminate intellectuals, as part of an attempt to make the country ungovernable. \u201cTerrorist forces are out to scare the scientific community,\u201d Al-Hussaini told  Nature  earlier this year. He believes that academics are targeted because they enjoy \u201cmuch greater prestige and status than in the West, and could transform Iraq into a modern society\u201d. Scientific and human-rights organizations, including Scholars at Risk, the International Council for Science and the American Association for the Advancement of Science, have called for assassinations and attacks to be better investigated, for security to be boosted at universities, and for those most at risk to be given asylum at universities abroad. But the killings continue. Among the most recent murders was that of Essam al-Rawi, a geologist and president of the University Professors' Union, who was shot dead on 30 October. A few days later, gunmen killed Jassim al-Asadi, a dean of the University of Baghdad, along with his wife and son. \n                     Iraqi death toll withstands scrutiny \n                   \n                     Scientists become targets in Iraq \n                   \n                     German hostage was saving Iraq digs \n                   \n                     US bungled investigation into weapons research in Iraq \n                   \n                     Iraqi killings prompt calls for US to evacuate weapons scientists \n                   \n                     Scholars at Risk \n                   \n                     International Council for Science \n                   \n                     American Association for the Advancement of Science \n                   \n                     Pugwash Conferences on Science and World Affairs \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

With a history of nurturing Nobel prizewinners and landing star roles in Hollywood films, the Arecibo radio telescope in Puerto Rico has worked its way into both scientific and popular cultures. Since 1963, the telescope's 70,000-square-metre collecting area has been used for everything from characterizing pulsars to the finale of the James Bond film  Goldeneye . But, according to a review committee, the facility should close if it cannot find outside financial support by 2011. The committee delivered its verdict to the Division of Astronomical Sciences of the US National Science Foundation (NSF) on 3 November. Arecibo is not the only facility facing the axe \u2014 the committee also recommended that the continent-wide Very Large Baseline Array should seek external funding or face closure. In addition, funding for operations by the National Solar Observatory (NSO) on Kitt Peak near Tucson, Arizona, and Sacramento Peak in Sunspot, New Mexico, could end if the planned Advanced Technology Solar Telescope receives final approval. None of the proposals is a death sentence; the NSF will consider the recommendations over the next couple of months. But the observatories in question may now turn to universities and foreign collaborators for funding. \u201cNobody's out here nailing plywood over the windows,\u201d says David Dooling, a spokesman for the NSO. \u201cWe think there are still a lot of years left.\u201d But the committee's findings highlight a growing problem in US ground-based astronomy: the expanding appetite for new telescopes doesn't leave much room for the continuing operations budgets of older telescopes such as Arecibo. Among other new projects, the NSF will pay $500 million for its share of the Atacama Large Millimeter Array, a 50-antenna cluster scheduled to be operational in Chile by 2013. The foundation also aims to participate in the Square Kilometre Array, an international effort likely to cost more than a billion dollars in total. \u201cTo make room for the new you have to trim some of the old,\u201d says Michael Turner, an astrophysicist at the University of Chicago. \u201cIf you keep building new facilities without closing old facilities, eventually the operations budget eats your entire budget.\u201d To that end, the committee \u2014 led by astronomer Roger Blandford of Stanford University \u2014 was asked in October 2005 to find ways of saving $30 million in the NSF's astronomy facilities budget by 2011. The committee report recommends that astronomical facilities \u201cplan for a natural life cycle ending, in every case, with closure\u201d. Turner says that ground-based astronomy has so far been spared difficult choices over which facilities to close, unlike the decommissioning of space telescopes: \u201cThis is much more difficult to do on the ground because space facilities fall from the sky and don't live in anyone's congressional district.\u201d (This might surprise Maryland Senator Barbara Mikulski, whose support of life-extending missions to the Hubble Space Telescope has been appreciated at the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, Maryland.) Donald Campbell, an astronomer at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, who has used Arecibo to study planets and the Moon, says that the telescope's potential closure is particularly painful in light of major upgrades, the latest in 1997. If Arecibo closes, he says he will have to rely entirely on the less-sensitive Goldstone radar telescope operated by NASA in California's Mojave Desert. \u201cIt's a great shame that the choice has to come down to closing facilities that are unique,\u201d he says. Observers overseas agree. \u201cIt's a pity that they were under pressure to make these cuts in facilities that were still productive by the standards of other scientific facilities,\u201d says Martin Rees, a cosmologist at the University of Cambridge, UK, and president of the Royal Society. Rees says that Britain faced a similar decision when it elected to join the European Southern Observatory, and funding pressures forced the country to close some smaller telescopes. \n                     Is ice on the Moon just a mirage? \n                   \n                     Decadal surveys: Wishing for the stars \n                   \n                     Astronomers told to cut it out \n                   \n                     Radio astronomy: High and dry \n                   \n                     Space telescopes: Mountain at the top \n                   \n                     The state of the Universe \n                   \n                     NSF Division of Astronomical Sciences (AST) \n                   \n                     AST Senior Review \n                   \n                     Arecibo Observatory \n                   \n                     Very Long Baseline Array \n                   \n                     National Solar Observatory \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Rex Dalton talks to the experts who are redrawing the details of Earth history. By fine-tuning their techniques, researchers are refining their ability to measure ever more precisely the ticking of Earth's geological clock. For decades, geologists and palaeontologists have had only ball-park estimates for when major events happened in the history of life on Earth. Now a series of new methods has radically improved their understanding of time long gone 1 . With unprecedented precision, researchers are now arguing over whether date estimates are off by as little as 100,000 years \u2014 remarkably accurate for events that may have occurred hundreds of millions of years ago. Leading the quest for increasing accuracy is the international EARTHTIME project, the brainchild of Sam Bowring, a geologist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Cambridge. Its goal is nothing less than a complete restructuring of the chronology of deep time 2 . \u201cIn a decade, we hope to radically recalibrate Earth's history back to the origin of animals,\u201d Bowring says. Researchers involved in the effort gathered in Philadelphia last month at a meeting of the Geological Society of America to plan out their strategy. Yet as they try to standardize their complex dating procedures, they must accept a re-evaluation of dates that they themselves may have determined. Last year, Bowring won a US$1-million grant for research with about 225 collaborators for three years from the National Science Foundation. In January, team members plan to apply for another grant to undertake 'a proof of concept' experiment \u2014 seeing whether they can standardize geological dates for the Cretaceous\u2013Tertiary (K/T) mass extinction about 65 million years ago. The group hopes to date the K/T boundary in a series of sediments in eastern Colorado, and use that date as a benchmark for studies in other geographical regions. They will also target another geologic interval from the Cretaceous period, about 90 million to 100 million years ago, to further cross-check dates and develop a precise chronology. Douglas Erwin, a palaeobiologist at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington DC and co-organizer of EARTHTIME, notes that major extinctions are often followed by a burst of speciation. \u201cI think these new dating methods will be a powerful spur to new work on evolutionary rates,\u201d he says. One of EARTHTIME's major thrusts will involve 'astronomical tuning', as Earth's orbital motion affects the geological record. Earth's changing movements \u2014 the angle of the globe's spin axis, the path of its orbit and the orientation of its axis relative to the Sun \u2014 change cyclically, and in turn influence climate. These climatic changes appear in the sedimentary record as changes in the thickness of sediment layers, in the ratio of carbon or oxygen isotopes, and in the abundance of tiny fossils, for example. Scientists have already calculated this astronomical record as far back as nearly 40 million years. Now they plan to push it back even further. Traditional techniques to date rocks include identifying fossils that were known to exist during particular eras; counting the ratios of different isotopes of radioactive elements, such as uranium, argon or lead, as these change over time; or relying on the intermittent reversals of Earth's magnetic field, recorded in rocks. But although such methods can estimate the age and conditions under which a particular rock was formed, they cannot reveal how long those conditions lasted. That's where astronomical tuning comes in, by providing a long-running sequence of climatic events, such as ice ages, that are recorded in seafloor cores. \u201cYou see variations of colour and lightness in the cores,\u201d says Heiko Palike, a geologist at the National Oceanography Centre in Southampton, UK. \u201cIt is like counting tree rings, then analysing the isotopic composition of the microfossil shells in the layers.\u201d \n               Deep time \n             To expand this astronomical record, researchers are designing ocean drilling expeditions primarily to examine these time-specific sedimentary cores 3 . The drill ship  JOIDES Resolution  is set to travel to the Pacific Ocean in November 2007, to drill a core dating between 35 million to 55 million years ago, to help pin down the chronology of events during that time period. But ocean cores only can reveal sediments going back about 180 million years; any older sediments have been recycled into Earth's interior. When it comes to exploring further back in time, geochemical analyses are the gold standard \u2014 specifically, isotopic analyses of radioactive elements as they decay. Methods include argon/argon dating, which compares the amount of radioactive argon-40 and argon-39, and uranium/lead dating, which does the same with isotopes of uranium and lead. Argon/argon dating can date materials from 2,000 years ago back to Earth's birth, some 4.5 billion years ago. The uranium/lead technique's usefulness ranges backwards in time from about 10 million years ago. There are some 50 labs worldwide doing argon/argon dating, but of 20 in the United States, only about five will be able to obtain EARTHTIME's desired degree of precision, says Paul Renne, director of the Berkeley Geochronology Center in California. Researchers use radioactive reagents, typically argon, uranium or lead, to correct for material lost in analysis. But these 'spikes' tend to vary between labs, increasing the margin of error. In a bid to enforce standardization, Bowring bought up all the available spikes, and EARTHTIME investigators now obtain them from Bowring's lab at MIT. The techniques for uranium/lead dating have also improved. For instance, the Arizona LaserChron Center at the University of Arizona combines a laser with a mass spectrometer to produce uranium/lead dates on zircons \u2014 microscopic crystals found in sediments. In the 1990s, multiple zircons often were used for dating analyses, but now a single zircon can be dated accurately, reducing the error from averaging the dates from several zircons. But the most important development in uranium/lead dating has been the ability to treat zircons to compensate for the loss of lead from radiation. James Mattinson of the University of California, Santa Barbara, revolutionized the field with a high-temperature technique 4  for removing zircon surfaces that may have lost lead over geologic time, introducing errors. \n               The date debate \n             Mattinson's technique prompted others to reanalyse material from hotly debated points in time, such as the Permian\u2013Triassic boundary (P/Tr), a mass extinction of terrestrial and marine life that occurred some 250 million years ago. The ebb and flow of this dispute \u2014 which involves key EARTHTIME members \u2014 shows the personal investment researchers have in their dates, and shows how hard it can be for them to jettison their published views. In 1998, Bowring and colleagues reported uranium/lead zircon dates for the P/Tr boundary of 251.4 million years ago, plus or minus 300,000 years 5 . But in 2001, Roland Mundil of the Berkeley geochronology lab questioned Bowring's date, suggesting that the MIT group had not sufficiently accounted for lead loss in its analysis of multiple zircon batches 6 . After learning of Mattinson's technique, Mundil applied it to P/Tr zircons \u2014 and placed the mass extinction at 252.6 million years ago, plus or minus 200,000 years 7 . The difference between the two figures might not seem much, but both sides clung on to their view \u2014 just as the presses were set to roll for the new edition of a major reference text,  A Geological Time Scale 2004  (ref.  8 ). The book used MIT's dates, prompting \u201ca great deal of criticism\u201d, says James Ogg, a geologist at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana, who co-edited the book. Now, Ogg says, the prevailing view is that Mundil was correct. \u201cWe should have listened to Mundil more,\u201d he says, and an earlier date for the P/Tr boundary will probably be used in the next edition of the book, scheduled for 2008. At a conference two months ago in Melbourne, Australia, Bowring reported his team's latest date for the same event: 252 million years, plus or minus 100,000 years. \u201cThe philosophy of EARTHTIME is to resolve these kinds of debates to the highest level,\u201d he says. \n                     Ocean drilling: Digging in \n                   \n                     Geologists seek to put an end to blind dates \n                   \n                     EarthTime \n                   \n                     International Commission on Stratigraphy \n                   \n                     Arizona LaserChron Center \n                   \n                     Integrated Ocean Drilling Program \n                   \n                     Chronos \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Zapping people's brains with an electric current while they sleep might not sound such a good idea. But by boosting natural brain waves it can improve memory, as new work shows. This approach might one day help us learn better or provide new treatments for sleep disorders. One of the functions of sleep is generally agreed to be the consolidation of memories: certain tasks learned before a snooze are remembered better than if no nap follows. Now Jan Born and his colleagues at the University of L\u00fcbeck in Germany think they know why. One theory holds that levels of brain chemicals, or neuromodulators, are what affects memory during sleep. But Born wanted to test a competing idea \u2014 that waves, or oscillations, of electrical activity are responsible. To pinpoint which part of sleep contributes to strengthening memory, the team used a weak electrical current to boost brain activity during deep sleep. Oscillations in electrical activity occur naturally, at different frequencies, during different sleep phases throughout the night. Oscillations are fastest during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, and slowest in phases of deep sleep. Boosting the slow waves seems to be the key to boosting memory, says Born. \u201cBy inducing such slow oscillations, we can say for the first time that slow oscillations are the cause\u201d of memory enhancement during sleep, he says. The findings are published online in  Nature  this week (L. Marshall  et al .  Nature   doi:10.1038/nature05278 ; 2006; News and Views  doi:10.1038/nature05309 ; 2006). Some previous studies have suggested a correlation between slow oscillations and memory enhancement. If people learn a task before sleeping, their brains show more slow-wave activity when they are asleep. But other researchers have failed to establish a link, leading some to believe that the waves are functionless by-products of the sleeping brain. Born and his colleagues had 13 medical students memorize 46 pairs of words before going to sleep. Four electrodes were then strapped to each volunteer's scalp and, once the students were in a phase of slow-wave sleep, the researchers induced a weak electrical current for five periods of five minutes each. The students were allowed to sleep undisturbed until morning, when they were retested on the same word task. A control group that did not receive brain stimulation remembered on average 37.4 words before they went to sleep and 39.5 when they woke up. The test group remembered an average of 36.5 words before sleeping, but recalled 41.2 after the treatment. Born says this improvement is remarkable, because medical students are presumably already skilled at remembering facts. What's more, there was no memory enhancement when the researchers tried to mimic the faster-oscillating brain waves in other phases of sleep, or when they applied the stimulation at the end of the night, rather than the beginning. The treatment didn't work for all tasks, however. Slowly oscillating waves seem to improve recall of words and facts, but the volunteers were no better at remembering a finger-tapping task. Born suspects that this type of memory is consolidated during REM sleep. So how does it work? The team suggests that the slow oscillations help the brain replay newly formed memories during sleep, by triggering intracellular signals in nerve cells that strengthen the connections between them. That could explain, Born says, why memory gets better when artificial electrical stimulants help boost the natural brain waves. But don't expect a do-it-yourself memory-enhancement kit to appear on the market overnight. It's easy to imagine, says Born, how overnight stimulation might come in handy for cramming for exams or memorizing that big presentation. But the team did not test the volunteers later, to see if the effect persists, and do not know if there are any long-term side effects to the treatment. \u201cI don't think one can do it at home,\u201d says Derk-Jan Dijk, a sleep expert at the University of Surrey's Sleep Research Centre in Guildford, UK. \u201cWe still need to find out what potential negative consequences could be if this stimulation is done for a longer period of time. Applying stimulation to the brain is something that for the time being we really would like to do in a controlled environment.\u201d Similar electrically based approaches are sometimes used in psychiatry. Some patients with depression, for example, seem to benefit from a technique called transcranial magnetic stimulation, where an electromagnetic current is generated in the brain by an applied magnetic field. Born thinks that his ideas too might be used in therapy some day. Perhaps, he suggests, doctors could boost the brain's natural waves to treat sleep disorders, depression or perhaps even the reduction in slow-wave sleep that comes with ageing. But he recognizes these applications are far in the future: \u201cIt's just a dream,\u201d he says. \n                     Socialites need more sleep \n                   \n                     Sleep-dependent memory consolidation \n                   \n                     Neuroscience: While you were sleeping \n                   \n                     To sleep, perchance to learn \n                   \n                     Sleep Insight \n                   \n                     Department of Neuroendocrinology at the University of L\u00fcbeck \n                   \n                     Surrey Sleep Research Centre \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Anyone who has ever put together self-assembly furniture knows that having the right parts is important, but what you do with them can make or break the project. The same seems to be true of the vast amounts of DNA in an organism's genome that used to be labelled as junk. Studies now indicate that this DNA may be responsible for the signals that were crucial for human evolution, directing the various components of our genome to work differently from the way they do in other organisms. The findings seem to bolster a 30-year-old hypothesis that gene regulation \u2014 not the creation of new genes \u2014 has moulded the traits that make us unique. The latest work looks for regions of the genome that have changed rapidly in human evolution, based on the theory that they are most likely to have shaped our differences from other animals. But instead of hunting for rapidly evolving DNA in genes, researchers are starting to look at non-coding DNA \u2014 stretches of DNA that don't encode proteins. In a paper published in  Science  on 3 November, for example, a group led by Edward Rubin of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) in Berkeley, California, reports the result of one hunt through the non-coding genome 1 . The team defined a group of 110,549 regions of non-coding DNA that are largely the same in humans and other mammals, reasoning that these regions must be important or they would have changed by randomly mutating over time. The researchers then narrowed the list to 992 regions that have changed markedly in humans compared with other mammals. Finally, they asked, if these pieces of DNA are regulators, what biological functions do they control? They found that these stretches of non-coding DNA tend to lie near genes involved in brain-cell function \u2014 specifically, in building connections between brain cells. This suggests that the non-coding DNA pieces might orchestrate the wiring of our brains, says team member Shyam Prabhakar, a computational biologist also at LBNL. \u201cThis is really very striking,\u201d he says. \u201cIt's the biggest signal we see in human evolution.\u201d Other genome analysts agree that the study is intriguing, but add a few notes of caution. First, the statistical significance of the link to the brain isn't as strong as some would like. Second, it's not clear whether the rapidly changing DNA is actually changing its function, or just accumulating insignificant mutations \u2014 in other words, were the changes caused by natural selection? But the paper seems to agree with other recent analyses of non-coding DNA. The first, published by David Haussler's group at the University of California, Santa Cruz, used stricter data limits to define 202 rapidly evolving regions of DNA 2 . Many of these were non-coding, but the most dramatically evolving piece of DNA encodes an RNA molecule that is expressed in developing brain tissue 3 . Another analysis, not yet published, from Manolis Dermitzakis's group at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute in Cambridge, UK, uses slightly different methods to trawl through non-coding DNA and finds 1,500 regions of interest. Some of those overlap with both Haussler's and Rubin's analyses, although Dermitzakis doesn't find the same association with brain function as does Rubin's group. But in unpublished work Gerton Lunter, a bioinformatician at the University of Oxford, UK, has found a link to the brain when he compares human and mouse non-coding DNA. Altogether, Lunter says, the various results seem to be defining a set of key non-coding regions. \u201cIt all points in the same direction, so I think it's believable,\u201d he says. The challenge, of course, is to figure out how these DNA segments control our fate. On 5 November, Rubin's group published a method for identifying which pieces of non-coding DNA act to enhance the expression of nearby genes 4 . This is just one possible function of non-coding DNA; elsewhere, it might act as regulatory RNA, or do things researchers can't even guess at yet. But that's what makes non-coding DNA so much fun, says Haussler. \u201cHere we have a way of discovering new biology,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd looking at that biology is going to be so exciting.\u201d \n                     Mix and match: the hunt for what makes us human \n                   \n                     Multiple copies of a mystery gene may make us human \n                   \n                     Homing in on the genes for humanity \n                   \n                     'Junk' DNA reveals vital role \n                   \n                     Chimp genome web focus \n                   \n                     Chimp genome news special \n                   \n                     Human Genome Collection \n                   \n                     NHGRI Comparative Genomics fact sheet \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Two papers \u2014 one published more than a decade ago and the other a preprint from last year \u2014 have raised doubts among experts about the work of a world-renowned microscopy laboratory. In a Corrigendum in this week's issue of  Nature  (see  page 235 ), three authors from an atomic-imaging group at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee admit to treating critical data inconsistently in a paper from 1993 (ref.  1 ). Two of the three authors are also co-authors on an August 2005 paper, on the arxiv.org preprint server 2 , in which some data were reproduced from one of the group's earlier papers 3  without citation and another figure included duplicated data points on two sides of a plot. The authors posted a revised version, with added citations and a replacement figure, on 15 May 2006 (ref.  4 ). An investigation over the summer by an independent panel, formed at the behest of the Oak Ridge lab, found \u201cno evidence of research misconduct or fraud in either paper\u201d, according to James Roberto, the lab's deputy director for science and technology. But within the community, doubts linger. \u201cIt's obvious that some games are being played,\u201d comments John Silcox of Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, who was a reviewer of the 1993  Nature  article. \u201cI don't trust their work.\u201d Few researchers were willing to go on the record, but several told  Nature  privately that they also were concerned about the papers. The group is led by Stephen Pennycook, a physicist who has been at Oak Ridge since 1982. His group helped pioneer the scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM), which uses a narrow beam of electrons to simultaneously take spectra of and image materials. The microscopes cost millions of dollars and the field is intensely competitive. Pennycook's group is at the forefront, says John Spence, a physicist at Arizona State University in Tempe: \u201cThey have the best machine, the most money, and very good people.\u201d In the  Nature  paper, the collaboration reported taking spectra and images of a boundary between a thin wafer of cobalt silicide and one of silicon. At the time, imaging such an interface was difficult. The team proved it was possible by showing clear spectra of both the cobalt silicide and silicon. But in the Corrigendum, the authors admit that the cobalt silicide spectra were reproduced from an earlier conference paper by the same group 5 . The admission contradicts the authors' response to a 1993 referee report (obtained independently and verified by  Nature 's news team) in which they deny that the spectra came from the proceedings. Pennycook says that the original statements were made because the group was confused about the referee's criticisms. The duplication of some but not all spectra meant that different methods were used to process the background noise on either side of the boundary. Some researchers are unfazed by the error: \u201cClearly it's a minor mistake, but fundamentally it has no influence on the results,\u201d says Christian Colliex, head of the STEM group at the University of Paris South, who collaborates with Pennycook but had no role in the 1993 paper. But others believe the mistake should invalidate the result. \u201cI don't understand why they haven't retracted this paper,\u201d says Silcox.  Nature 's view is given on  page 123 . The more recent arxiv.org paper is also a study of the boundary between two materials: one ferromagnetic and one superconducting. In the first version of the paper 2 , several graphs and one image appear identical to those in an earlier paper by the group 3 . In addition, a plot in the paper contains identical but mirrored data on its right- and left-hand sides. \u201cIt looks fishy,\u201d says David Muller, a physicist at Cornell, who obtained his PhD under Silcox. The paper was first posted at arxiv.org on 23 August 2005. Others in the field became aware of the irregularities in the spring of 2006, when a version was submitted to  Nature Physics , according to sources outside  Nature  familiar with its history. Within days of being notified of the issues, the authors posted a revised version 4 , which added references for all but one image. It also contained a version of the data plot that had been cropped in a way that eliminates the duplicated data points. In a phone interview, Pennycook and lead author Maria Valera admitted that the data were duplicated on either side of the plot: \u201cI think it was an effort to make it look more attractive to  Nature  editors, frankly,\u201d Pennycook says. \u201cIt was the wrong thing to do,\u201d adds Valera.

One of Europe's star universities nose-dived into crisis last week when its faculty members forced the president to resign. Molecular biologist Ernst Hafen, who took over the reins at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH) in Zurich last December, submitted his resignation letter on 1 November, a day before a planned faculty vote of confidence he was certain to lose. \u201cIt has become clear over the past few days that I don't have the necessary support to continue,\u201d Hafen said in a statement. Hafen had been mandated to reform the ETH by its supervisory council. But his style and his plans both angered and failed to convince senior professors, who banded together to demand that he go. Hafen is not the first ETH president to have been forced out \u2014 there was a quiet resignation in the late 1980s. But the university, which trumpeted its 150th anniversary last year, has never experienced such hostile internal turmoil. The ETH came out as the top-performing university in mainland Europe and 27th in the world in the University of Shanghai's 2006 world ranking of universities. It claims 21 Nobel prizewinners, starting with the first laureate, Wilhelm R\u00f6ntgen, in 1901. Alexander Zehnder, president of the ETH Council, had even greater ambitions: he wanted to raise the university into the top ten worldwide, and asked Hafen to make organizational changes to that end. Hafen, a highly regarded researcher with a strong publication record, had been considered by the ETH Council \u2014 a body nominated for five-year periods by the Swiss federal government \u2014 as an ideal candidate to do this. At 50, he was still young. He had experience in setting up a biotech company, The Genetics Company, and he worked in a research area \u2014 systems biology \u2014 that is a Swiss priority. Hafen is one of the co-developers of Systems X, the prestigious Swiss national systems-biology network. Former scientific colleagues refer to Hafen as warm and collegial. But ETH faculty members were clearly not seduced, claiming that his challenges to all aspects of their work encroached on their traditional autonomy. They said that his plans for a rapid reform of the university, a programme known internally as ETH 2020, were ill conceived \u2014 and that Hafen often failed to explain which problems they were designed to solve, and how they would solve them. Worse still, critics say, Hafen set up a consultation procedure but then ignored their own carefully formulated input. Attacks on Hafen by some faculty members reportedly became personal. Key reforms included abolishing the position of rector, who is elected by the faculty to take charge of university teaching, which under the new plan would be run by the president's office, and changing the ETH's 15 departments into a smaller number of schools to be run by professional deans. This structure was introduced into Switzerland's other federal university, EPF Lausanne, five years ago and met \u201ca lot of resistance from the faculty initially\u201d, says Patrick Aebischer, the university's president. Aebischer's reforms, which included the addition of a new life-sciences department, are now widely regarded internally and externally as a success. But at the ETH, Hafen was unable to overcome faculty resistance. As tempers peaked at the end of October, the ETH board, composed of the rector, the president and two vice-presidents, put the ETH 2020 programme on hold \u2014 against Hafen's wishes. The heads of all departments except biology, where Hafen remains a faculty member, supported a letter on 24 October demanding his resignation. After attempts at reconciliation and public statements admitting his mistakes, Hafen finally conceded defeat. The rector, Konrad Osterwalder, will act as president until a new one is appointed, a process that may take at least a year. \n                 See Editorial, page 123. \n               \n                     Another one bites the dust \n                   \n                     Synthetic biology: Designs on life \n                   \n                     ETH Zurich \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

NEW ORLEANS It may soon be possible to assess the health of an embryo created by  in vitro  fertilization (IVF) without interfering with a single cell on its future body. New assays that look for tell-tale molecules secreted by healthy embryos could help reproductive biologists select the embryos that are most likely to produce a baby. In IVF, several embryos are usually created. Embryologists try to select the healthiest by visual inspection of the number of cells or the rate at which they divide, and transfer these back to the womb. But these assessments are subjective and fallible. In the United States, on average less than 40% of IVF cycles end in pregnancy. To improve the odds, doctors routinely transfer multiple embryos, increasing the risk of twins or triplets. Now researchers are working on selection methods that are quicker, more objective and leave the embryo intact. Several research groups and companies presented preliminary studies at the meeting of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine in New Orleans last week. Such tests could boost pregnancy rates as well as reduce the need to transfer several embryos and risk multiple births. \u201cEveryone's arriving at the same realization,\u201d says Dagan Wells, who studies gene expression in eggs at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut. Many groups are trying to find a fingerprint of proteins or metabolites that only healthy embryos secrete. Emre Seli at Yale and David Burns at McGill University in Montreal, Canada, have used spectroscopy to identify such a signature in the media in which embryos are grown. Two trials reported at the meeting showed that the test could predict which embryos would implant with more than 70% accuracy. Seli says he will start recruiting women into a larger clinical trial within months. Others are trying to assess eggs after they are collected but before fertilization. Selecting the most promising could allow fewer embryos to be created. This would be particularly useful in countries with legal restrictions such as Italy, where the law permits only three eggs at a time to be fertilized. A group led by Samir Hamamah, who heads the assisted-reproduction unit at the H\u00f4pital Arnaud de Villeneuve in Montpellier, France, is extracting and analysing the proteins in the cumulus cells that nestle intimately around an egg when it is ovulated. Hamamah reported in New Orleans that he has identified a handful of proteins that are manufactured at higher or lower levels in the cumulus cells of human eggs that go on to be fertilized compared with those that do not (S. Hamamah  et al .  RBM Online ,  http://www.rbmonline.com/Article/2559 ). Like any development in reproductive biology, such tests are unlikely to come without controversy. Some researchers claim that tests for an antigen called HLA-G in the growth medium of an embryo can predict the outcome of IVF. But not everyone is convinced that its levels really correlate with pregnancy. Any new test should be shown to boost pregnancy rates in clinical trials before it is offered to patients, says Mandy Katz-Jaffe at the Colorado Center for Reproductive Medicine in Englewood. Katz-Jaffe believes she can take such screening methods one step further. She is working on an ambitious test that will not only distinguish healthy embryos, but reveal whether or not an embryo carries a specific chromosomal abnormality. At present, technicians can extract a cell from an embryo and test it for genetic defects, a procedure called preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD). But it's unclear whether this subtly damages the embryo. Katz-Jaffe is searching for proteins that are secreted at different levels by embryos with specific chromosomal defects, for example an extra copy of chromosome 21. But Santigao Munne, an expert in PGD at diagnostic genetics company Reprogenetics in Livingston, New Jersey, questions whether this approach can replace PGD: \u201cIt's a lot of noise,\u201d he says. He believes that rather than detecting signs of particular abnormalities, such assays may simply be picking up molecules released by embryos that have stopped growing. \n                     Making the most of a little DNA \n                   \n                     UK to extend embryo testing \n                   \n                     Biologists forced to reassess embryo test \n                   \n                     Test could boost IVF success \n                   \n                     Fertility supplement \n                   \n                     Fertility outlook \n                   \n                     American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM) \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Lucy, the famed Ethiopian fossil, may soon take to the sky to sparkle on her first US tour. But where the 3.2-million-year-old hominid will travel after an initial appearance in Houston is unclear, with many anthropologists fearing that the risk to the fragile skeleton is too great. On 24 October, Ethiopian government officials announced an agreement with the Houston Museum of Natural Science to exhibit Lucy's skeleton and nearly 200 other artefacts, beginning in September 2007. Few have seen the Lucy remains, found in 1974 and named after the song  Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds  by The Beatles. The skeleton, which is 40% complete, is kept in a vault in the basement of the Ethiopian National Museum in Addis Ababa. If palaeoanthropologists agree on anything, it is that original fossils should not travel, to keep them safe and available for research. A policy statement issued by the International Association for the Study of Human Paleontology says that valuable remains should be moved only for \u201ccompelling scientific reasons\u201d. Casts are typically displayed instead. But Joel Bartsch, president of the Houston museum, argues that museums such as his have the expertise to handle delicate specimens. He sees the exhibit as an opportunity \u201cto raise the profile of a country that is home to the cradle of mankind\u201d. Sating public hunger for historical reality can bring sorely needed funds to the home countries of valuable artefacts. The Tutankhamun tour, currently being visited by throngs across the United States, has brought Egypt millions of dollars to help it preserve its antiquities. But whereas Egypt has kept the most valuable human remains at home, Ethiopia and Kenya seem willing to tour their prize exhibits. In another attempt at a high-profile fossil tour, officials from the National Museums of Kenya flew to the Field Museum in Chicago in September to propose an exhibit centred on Nariokotome Boy, a 1.6-million-year-old fossil of a near-complete  Homo erectus  youth. The Kenyans then announced that the exhibit would lead to the return of some Kenyan antiquities held in the Field Museum \u2014 notably the Tsavo lions, stuffed man-eaters famous a century ago for killings outside Mombasa. But Neil Shubin, provost of the Field Museum, says he was stunned. \u201cThere was never a formal proposal made for an exhibit,\u201d he says, adding that there is no plan to send the lions back. Details of the Lucy tour, including where it will appear and how much money Ethiopia will get, are also unclear. Major US museums, including the American Museum of Natural History in New York and the Smithsonian Institution, say they are not interested, out of concern for the remains. Bartsch admits that no other museums have signed up yet, but says he anticipates intense interest for a ten-city tour. Jara Haile Mariam, manager of the Ethiopian culture ministry's Authority for Research and Conservation of Cultural Heritage, says that Ethiopia hopes to get US$5\u20136 million from the tour, with museums paying about $300,000 each for four-month exhibitions, plus a percentage of the takings. The Ann and Robert H. Lurie Foundation is also reported to have pledged $1 million, but Bartsch and the foundation declined to comment on the financial details. Despite the difficulties over agreeing terms, those who advocate sending African fossils abroad say it will allow them to be studied at high-tech US institutions, and will encourage tourism and trade in their countries of origin by inspiring Western museum-goers.

An ambitious radio array project that will join the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) is running into money problems. Construction of the Allen Telescope Array, named after its chief benefactor, Microsoft co-founder and billionaire Paul Allen, will halt at the end of this year unless further funding is found. Allen is currently withholding millions because the project has failed to recruit other donors. \u201cDown here in the trenches it's really terribly worrisome,\u201d says Jill Tarter, director of the privately funded SETI Institute in Mountain View, California, which is developing the project. The array, which is being built at Hat Creek Radio Observatory in California, was conceived in the late 1990s as a cheap way to search for extraterrestrial radio transmissions. For about $25 million, researchers believed they could build a radio telescope with 350 commercially available satellite dishes. The price went up to $43 million in 2003, when scientists decided to upgrade the dishes and other components, allowing the array to do radio astronomy as well as searching for alien signals. In 2000, Allen gave the project's research budget $11.5 million. He pledged $13.5 million more for construction in 2003 \u2014 but the money was contingent on the SETI Institute raising another $16 million in private funding (see  Nature   428 , 358; 2004). To date, the institute has raised less than $9 million. Allen is withholding $3.85 million until the institute can \u201cmeet its contractual obligations\u201d, says Jason Hunke, a spokesman for the Paul G. Allen Family Foundation, based in Seattle, Washington. Astronomers often use private funding for telescopes, and almost as often find themselves in tight spots. Researchers at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) in Pasadena nearly abandoned the second of the huge Keck telescopes before NASA provided a multi-million-dollar bailout. And the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, a $70-million map of the sky, had to beg and borrow from collaborators, says James Gunn, a founder of the project at Princeton University in New Jersey. \u201cWe were on the edge of financial disaster more or less continuously,\u201d he says, adding that the project has since repaid most of its debts. With the funds currently available, the Allen Telescope Array will have just 42 of its planned 350 dishes up by the end of the year, according to Leo Blitz, an astronomer at the University of California, Berkeley, the project's major collaborator. This will still be enough to start doing science, he adds. But the full array would be much better, says Shri Kulkarni, a radio astronomer at Caltech. The more expensive array would deliver high-resolution, wide-angle images of the sky relatively cheaply, he says. And it would be an important proof-of-principle for future radio observatories, such as the international Square Kilometre Array. If the Allen array didn't move forward, Kulkarni says, \u201cit would be a pity in almost every way I could think of\u201d. \n                     News in brief \n                   \n                     The search for extraterrestrial intelligence \n                   \n                     The sky's the limit as radio telescope array is approved \n                   \n                     Microsoft moguls back search for ET intelligence \n                   \n                     Physical sciences news channel \n                   \n                     Space and astronomy news stories \n                   \n                     The Allen Array \n                   \n                     Caltech\u2019s Radio Astronomy Lab \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

No particle accelerator in the world is strong enough to create a usable beam of uranium ions. But that will change next month, when Japan switches on a huge facility of connected accelerators, to produce the world's most powerful beams of heavy radioactive isotopes. Radioisotopes are forms of elements that are unstable because they contain either more or fewer neutrons than usual, and so undergo radioactive decay. Nuclear physicists are studying rare short-lived isotopes to understand their properties and how they are formed. The RIKEN research institute in Saitama, Japan, already has accelerators that can create the world's strongest radioisotope beams, but even these are only powerful enough to produce usable beams for the lighter elements. Scientists will be able to study nuclear isotopes that exist only in the hottest stars. But next month, RIKEN will switch on a major upgrade. The \u00a544-billion (US$378 million) Radioactive Isotope Beam Factory will add two more ring cyclotrons and the world's first superconducting ring cyclotron to the existing linear accelerator and ring cyclotron. It will then be able to accelerate beams of any element up to uranium at 70% of the speed of light. The accelerated beams are smashed into a target such as beryllium to knock out neutrons and protons and create the desired radioisotopes. The facility should open a new realm of astrophysics. \u201cWith this new facility, scientists at RIKEN have the opportunity to study nuclear isotopes that exist only in the hottest stars of the Universe,\u201d says John Schiffer, a senior scientist at the Argonne National Laboratory in Chicago, Illinois. As well as exploring the formation of uranium, RIKEN plans to measure the properties of various very short-lived nuclei, as well as looking for 'magic numbers' of neutrons and protons that allow heavy nuclei to be surprisingly stable. These experiments will start from next year, with full operation scheduled for 2011. The facility makes Japan the world leader in the field, says Ysushige Yano, director of the RIKEN Nishina centre for accelerator-based science, adding that Japan's other big physics facilities have just been upgrades of US and European versions. \u201cBut this time it is different,\u201d he boasts. \u201cThis time, Japanese scientists are leading the way.\u201d Rivals aim not to let Japan savour its victory for long. A US plan for a superconducting linear accelerator called the Rare Isotope Accelerator has stalled, at a proposed cost of $1 billion.

An ecological survey of one of East Africa's worst-ever droughts provides a fresh look at how ecosystems respond to sudden, dramatic disturbances. The study documents a 19-year period in the late nineteenth century known to the native Masai people as  Emutai  \u2014 meaning 'to wipe out' \u2014 and it could help in determining how the landscape may respond to future climate shifts, as are predicted as a result of global warming. In 1891, when the Austrian explorer Oscar Baumann travelled in Masailand in modern-day Kenya, he was shocked to see \u201cwomen wasted to skeletons from whose eyes the madness of starvation glared\u201d. Drought had first struck in 1883; the rains later failed completely in 1897 and 1898; rinderpest and bovine pneumonia destroyed herds. The Masai, who traditionally rely on animals for all of their food, were faced with famine and smallpox. The latest research, published in the  African Journal of Ecology  ( 44,  458\u2013467; 2006) reveals the ecological after-effects. \u201cIt was already in the history books \u2014 I was trying to calibrate the palaeoecological record against historical records,\u201d says Lindsey Gillson of the University of Cape Town, who carried out the study at the University of Oxford's Environmental Change Unit. She travelled to Kenya's Tsavo National Park to collect sediment, pollen and charcoal samples to determine the extent of the drought. The abundance of pollen from marginal wetland plants shows that lake shores were retreating during the event, and the increased presence of charcoal shows that spontaneous fires were common \u2014 all features of a major drought. African ecologists need to consider how to apply their skills and knowledge to the impact on humans of climate change. Gillson's results confirm that the  Emutai  was indeed a 'large infrequent disturbance' \u2014 the kind of climatic event, such as droughts, floods or hurricanes, that can leave a lasting impression on the land. And it's the kind of event that experts predict will become more common as global warming proceeds. The work hints at the effects that can be expected if the region is hit by another drought of this severity. \u201cWhat we need is a kind of probability \u2014 if we got a drought like this, will x, y and z happen?\u201d says Gillson. And now that she has identified the ecological signature of the drought, looking back through the palaeoecological record should help to show how often such extreme events are occurring and whether that frequency is changing over time. But it will be crucial, Gillson adds, to link the ecological data more firmly with climate predictions, so that local people can be prepared and adapt to these changes. African ecologists need to consider how to apply their skills and knowledge to the impact on humans of climate change. Helping Africans adapt to climate change is a priority, says Jon Lovett, an environmental researcher at the University of York, UK. \u201cGiven the close relationship between African livelihoods and ecology, African ecologists need to consider urgently how to apply their skills and knowledge to the impact on humans of climate change,\u201d he says. That is especially true for the Masai. Development agencies are now urging them to diversify from their reliance on livestock and embrace staple crops. With three million Kenyans suffering from the current drought, the calls for a change of habits are growing louder. \n                     Developing world concerned over climate fund \n                   \n                     Developing countries get climate adaptation boost \n                   \n                     Economic review counts costs of climate change \n                   \n                     Sustainable outcomes from Gleneagles \n                   \n                     Are greenhouse gases drying Africa's dust bowl? \n                   \n                     Climate change in focus \n                   \n                     Nature newsblog: Earth systems science \n                   \n                     Earth and environment news \n                   \n                     University of Oxford Environmental Change Institute \n                   \n                     African Journal of Ecology \n                   \n                     Millennium Development Goals \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

At the time, it must have sounded like a sensible case of sustainable development. During the 1980s, about 2,500 square kilometres of Amazonian rainforest was flooded to create the Balbina dam to feed the energy demands of the Brazilian city of Manaus. A sizeable chunk of rainforest was lost, but Brazil gained access to a non-polluting energy source. It's a compromise Brazil has made many times; more than 80% of the country's domestic electricity is generated by hydropower plants. Yet the clean, green image of dams may have been seriously overstated. Researchers are gathering in Paris next week to discuss greenhouse-gas emissions from tropical reservoirs. Some of the latest findings point to a disturbing conclusion: that the global-warming impact of hydropower plants can often outweigh that of comparable fossil-fuel power stations. If that's correct, current energy strategies, particularly in developing nations, will need to be rethought. The problem lies with the organic matter in the reservoir. Large amounts are trapped when land is flooded to create the dam, and more is flushed in after that. In the warm water of tropical dams, this matter decays to form methane and carbon dioxide. Although both are greenhouse gases, the main worry is methane, which has more than 20 times the warming impact of carbon dioxide over a 100-year period. In the specific case of Balbina, there is now a rough consensus: in terms of avoiding greenhouse-gas emissions, a fossil-fuel plant would have been better. But that is where the agreement ends. On one side of the debate is Philip Fearnside, a conservation biologist at the National Institute for Research in the Amazon in Manaus. His work, based mainly on theoretical calculations, looks at water leaving dams. Many dams release water from several metres below the surface, so the flow goes through an abrupt pressure change. Fearnside calculates that this causes methane release, much as carbon dioxide fizzes out when carbonated drinks are opened. His latest results suggest that a typical tropical hydropower plant will, during the first ten years of its life, emit four times as much carbon as a comparable fossil-fuel station. Lining up against him in a decade-long dispute are Luiz Pinguelli Rosa and his colleagues at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, who accuse Fearnside of exaggerating reservoir emissions. They complain in particular that Fearnside has extrapolated from measurements taken on the Petit Saut dam in French Guiana; the data were taken in the years immediately after the reservoir was created, when the store of organic matter would have been greatest. If these estimates are correct, figures for annual global methane emissions need to be increased by a fifth. With few data sets available on tropical dams, the debate has increased in acrimony without approaching a conclusion. Environmental groups question the impartiality of Rosa's work, which is funded in part by the hydropower industry. Rosa strongly denies any bias, and in turn accuses Fearnside of seeking to show that \u201csomething is wrong with dams\u201d. The Paris meeting, which runs on 5\u20136 December and is organized by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), is unlikely to settle their dispute, but researchers will discuss new methane data. On 14 November, for example, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Gu\u00e9rin of the Laboratory of Meteorology in Toulouse, France, and his colleagues published results on methane release from sites downstream of three tropical dams 1 . They found that so much methane builds up in the dam that downstream emissions, which are rarely factored into estimates of a reservoir's impact, should account for between a tenth and a third of total emissions. Another new paper estimates that, for Balbina, downstream emissions alone have the same greenhouse warming potential as 6% of all the fossil fuels consumed by S\u00e3o Paulo, a city of more than 11 million people 2 . Even without these downstream emissions, the global impact of dams may be significant. Danny Cullenward, an energy-policy expert at Stanford University, has made preliminary calculations of the impact of Fearnside's findings. Cullenward stresses that more data are needed, but his estimates suggest that dams release between 95 million and 122 million tonnes of methane per year. If correct, estimates of annual global methane emissions (which do not generally include dam emissions) need to be increased by a fifth. Even extrapolating Rosa's figures gives Cullenward a total of 23 million tonnes. Many think enough is known to start acting now. Some worry about the huge dam projects tentatively planned for tropical areas, such as a $5-billion project on the Congo river. Another concern is the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), a system that allows developed nations to fund clean-energy projects in developing nations in return for credits that can be used to meet Kyoto Protocol targets. Current rules allow certain hydropower projects to be funded under the CDM, a situation some scientists and environmental groups would like to see revised. But matters are unlikely to change without more data, so researchers at the UNESCO meeting will discuss which questions to prioritize and how best to work together. More substantial progress could begin in 2008, when the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) will decide whether or not to start work on a special report on renewable energy. Previous IPCC special reports have had significant political impact, and the dams question is likely to fit very well into the scope of the proposed energy study, says Bert Metz, a climate-policy expert at the Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency and co-chair of one of the IPCC's three working groups. \n                     Tide of censure for African dams \n                   \n                     Damming evidence of human interference \n                   \n                     International Rivers Network Report on tropical dams \n                   \n                     Philip Fearnside's home page \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

When Dutch computer scientist Rudi Cilibrasi needed hundreds of hours-worth of computing time to test a data-mining algorithm earlier this month, he went not to his IT department but to Amazon.com. He paid $60 with his credit card, and in minutes had the equivalent of ten servers installed, which crunched through his job in a couple of days \u2014 ten times faster than his desktop PC would have managed. Large web companies such as Google, eBay and Amazon have far more computing power at their disposal than any academic networks, and have become leaders in massive-scale distributed computing. Many of their innovations can help scientists, and Amazon's computing-on-demand service, which has been running since August, is no exception. It enables customers to create multiple virtual computers on Amazon's massive computing infrastructure for $0.10 per computing hour, and to store data for $0.15 per gigabyte per month. The service is still in a test phase, so few scientists have even heard of it yet, let alone tried it. But it is a movement that experts believe could revolutionize how researchers use computers. In future, they will export computing jobs to industry networks rather than trying to run them in-house, says Alberto Pace, head of Internet services at CERN, the European particle-physics laboratory near Geneva. CERN has built the world's largest scientific computing grid, bringing together 10,000 computers in 31 countries to handle the 1.5 gigabytes of data that its new accelerator, the Large Hadron Collider, will churn out every second once it is switched on next year. You spend a few dollars, you have a computer farm and you get results. \u201cI see no reason why the Amazon service wouldn't take off,\u201d Pace says. \u201cFor a lab that wants to go fast and cheaply, this is a huge advantage over buying material and hiring IT staff. You spend a few dollars, you have a computer farm and you get results.\u201d Cilibrasi, a researcher at the National Institute for Mathematics and Computer Science in Amsterdam, was using Amazon's service to test an algorithm aimed at predicting how much someone will like a movie based on their current preferences. He says he is a convert: \u201cIt's substantially more reliable, cheaper and easier to use [than academic computing networks]. It opens up powerful computing-on-demand to the masses.\u201d It's not just computer scientists who could use cheap computing power. Climate researchers can run global-warming models, cosmologists might simulate the inside of a supernova or biologists could scale up the workings of a liver cell to the whole organ. The South African National Bioinformatics Institute at the University of Western Cape, Belleville, has already been testing Amazon's system to power large-scale genome comparisons. The pay-as-you-go system offers computing power and bandwidth that the institute could not afford to maintain itself, says Inus Scheepers, a systems administrator there. Cost is certainly one reason observers are excited about Amazon's system. Other companies, including Sun Microsystems, offer computing-on-demand, but Amazon's service costs a tenth as much. But the main attraction is Amazon's use of 'virtualization' technologies, which many predict will change not just research but computing itself. Virtualization uses a layer of software to allow multiple operating systems to run together. This means that different computers can be recreated on the same machine. So one machine can host say ten 'virtual' computers, each with a different operating system. That's a big deal. Running multiple virtual computers on a single server uses available resources much more efficiently. But it also means that instead of having to physically install a machine with a particular operating system, a virtual version can be created in seconds. Such virtual computers can be copied just like a file, and will run on any machine irrespective of the hardware it is using. \u201cIn the past, we had to install hardware and software for each machine,\u201d says Pace. Virtualization software is becoming widely available from companies such as Microsoft and VMware. Amazon uses Xen, an open-source system developed at the University of Cambridge, UK, which is fast becoming popular with researchers. As well as using Xen to enable virtual computers to run across a grid or cluster, despite different operating systems on the individual machines, researchers can also use applications developed on their lab computer. At present, to run an application on a large scale, they often need to rewrite it. With virtualization, researchers can create a copy of their own machine and use it to run large-scale simulations or searches, and it should work exactly as it does in the lab. Amazon's service combines the joys of virtualization with the huge computing power it has at its disposal. It's an approach that looks set to catch on. CERN has started an internal service similar to Amazon's, in which users can create or delete virtual machines on the fly. \u201cVirtualization is revolutionary,\u201d says Pace. \u201cIt's clear that this is one way to do scientific research in the future.\u201d \n                     Google makes data free for all \n                   \n                     Computer hardware: Silicon down to the wire \n                   \n                     Coming soon: a global grid for cancer research \n                   \n                     The Grid: Tomorrow's computing today \n                   \n                     2020 \u2013 Future of Computing web focus \n                   \n                     Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) - Limited Beta \n                   \n                     The Xen Virtual Machine Monitor \n                   \n                     Xensource Inc \n                   \n                     CERN Openlab \n                   \n                     Web resources for virtualization on Connotea \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Scientists said a sad goodbye last week to the orbiting spacecraft Mars Global Surveyor, which had gone missing two weeks earlier. The mission has been portrayed as heroically long-lived, surpassing all expectations and being extended four times until scientists finally lost contact with it just before the tenth anniversary of its launch. It's a familiar story for NASA missions \u2014 the Mars rovers Spirit and Opportunity have both lasted ten times longer than their 90-day intended lifetimes and continue to roam the planet, and the agency is spending billions of dollars on a shuttle mission to keep the Hubble Space Telescope running against all the odds. But however attached we might get to old missions, does it really make financial sense to run them until they break, get lost or fall into a hole too big to get out of? Extending missions is a trade-off between wringing as much science as possible out of a craft and redirecting resources into new missions. And at NASA, keeping missions going is seen as well worth the money. An extended mission typically costs a few million dollars a year to run, whereas a new launch can cost hundreds of millions or more. Critics might argue that the most important results from the Mars rovers, such as clinching the case that liquid water once existed on the planet, came from the early part of the mission. But Bruce Banerdt, rover project scientist at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, claims that every time the rovers move a few hundred metres, it's like landing a new lander: \u201cIt's scientifically cost-effective.\u201d Missions are judged on their scientific impact to date \u2014 science per dollar. James Green, director of NASA's planetaryscience division, acknowledges that with an extended mission you are restricted to the science the craft was designed for, rather than choosing what needs to done. But Green insists that, because they are so much cheaper than a new mission, extended missions are worth the effort. NASA's mission scientists bid for extensions once the primary science objectives have been fulfilled, and missions are judged on their scientific impact to date: \u201cscience per dollar\u201d, he says. Possible extensions are not mentioned in the initial mission planning stages, so designing missions to last longer than planned is an easy way for mission scientists to buy into future budgets. There's also the public-relations value \u2014 in terms of public image, it is better to say a mission will last for five years and then extend its life, than to say it will last for ten years and lose it after nine. The latter scenario would be seen as a failure, says Lori Garver, a former NASA associate administrator. She sees no problem with deliberately underestimating the life of a spacecraft. By the time a mission is ready to be extended, the big pots of money have already been spent on it, she says. Attitudes at the European Space Agency (ESA), which has a smaller budget and flies fewer missions (17 spacecraft are currently operational), are slightly different. Letting missions run until they fail, with no predefined notion of how long that might take, is not necessarily a sustainable strategy, says Giovanni Bignami, chairman of ESA's space-science advisory commission. \u201cBy continuing to extend missions you eat into resources that could be used to do something new,\u201d he explains. Up to 10% of ESA's budget is spent on keeping old missions alive, and Bignami says that no missions have been ended while they were still operational. But the agency expects that with several new craft due to launch in the next few years \u2014 including BepiColombo bound for Mercury, and Gaia, which will create a three-dimensional map of our Galaxy \u2014 it will become more difficult to keep old missions running. ESA approves missions for two years at a time, and some are definitely worth extending, says Bignami; for example, the XMM-Newton X-ray satellite, which is looking at black holes and exploding stars. He reckons that other missions might be easier to finish, such as Venus Express \u2014 there's a limit to how much useful data can be gathered by continuing to orbit Venus with the same instruments. Although many are sad to see Mars Global Surveyor go, Bignami also anticipates some happy faces at NASA, as an old mission is finally abandoned and new ones can begin.

Seoul Woo Suk Hwang has taken the stand in court in his defence for the first time. The once-lauded cloning expert was confident and at times defiant as he struck back at the prosecution's claims that he embezzled money, committed fraud and broke a bioethics law, at one point citing dealings with the Russian mafia to explain himself. Hwang electrified the scientific world in 2004 and 2005 with announcements that he had cloned human embryos and extracted stem cells with great therapeutic potential. But all the results were then shown to be fake. Hwang was charged in May with fraud, embezzlement of 2.8 billion won (US$3 million) and violation of bioethics legislation that outlaws the purchase of eggs for research. Several of his colleagues were also charged with various offences. Tracking Hwang's research funding has not been easy, and it is still not clear where all the money came from or where it ended up. For example, receipts for hundreds of millions of won for buying pigs and cows were faked. Prosecutors have struggled to track Hwang's expenses through at least 63 bank accounts carrying the names of members of his research team, a high-school classmate and a relative, as well as pig and cow dealers. Hwang first denied but later admitted using these accounts. According to the prosecutor's report, Hwang used to carry a bag full of cash to different bank branches, making relatively small deposits in various accounts minutes or hours apart. The defence denies embezzlement, claiming that Hwang was not trying to fill his own coffers. Hwang's lawyers explained that money earmarked for buying cows and paying for junior lab members' housing was simply spent as part of overall research expenditures. \u201cHwang had no intention to make himself rich,\u201d says Keun-Hwa Jung, one of a team of at least five independent lawyers working on the case, pointing out that a tally of research spending shows that Hwang spent more than he received. When he got the chance to put his side of the story, Hwang strode into court looking relaxed, shaking hands with supporters. He explained some of the faked receipts by saying that he had given money to a Russian mafia group, as part of an effort to get tissue samples of a mammoth he was hoping to clone. He could not get receipts for those funds, Hwang told the court. The story is not as far-fetched as it might seem: there are ongoing mammoth-cloning projects in Japan. Hwang was keen to clone many different animals, including an endangered Korean tiger. And there is a black market for mammoth remains. Still, it is not clear how Hwang would have explained where he got the tissues if he had succeeded in creating a mammoth. The lawyers also fended off the fraud allegations. The prosecution says that Hwang secured billions of Korean won from private companies using data that he knew to be faked. But Hwang claims he believed that at least some of the cell lines, including the original cell line presented in 2004, were real. Hwang admits ordering the fabrication of certain images, including slides of teratomas. The ability of stem-cell lines to form teratomas proves their ability to form virtually all types of body cells. But the tests take months, so when they did not work out, Hwang says he ordered faked photographs \u201cto save time\u201d. He maintains, however, contrary to testimony by other researchers on the team, that he was not involved in any tests that would indicate he knew that the cell lines were fake, such as DNA fingerprinting tests that are necessary to match cell lines to the donor from which they are cloned. Hwang's lawyers already have their case prepared for the next hearing, which will deal with the allegation that Hwang violated the country's bioethics law when he used eggs from women who were given free IVF treatments in exchange for donating eggs. The law prohibits the provision of any \u201cfinancial reward, property, or any other personal benefits\u201d for the donation of sperm or eggs. But the lawyers will claim that illegal benefits do not include IVF treatment. \u201cWe have to rely on the spirit of the law here because the law itself is very unclear,\u201d says Jung. Jung says that he hopes the judge will hand down a verdict by the end of the year. Hwang seems confident, and in anticipation of his acquittal has started up a new research institute in the outskirts of Seoul. One researcher there, who did not wish to be named without Hwang's approval, said he is very happy to be able to work with Hwang, which would have been unthinkable before. The institute is reportedly trying to clone pigs with humanized organs for transplantation, but the researcher refused to give any details. If that happens, Hwang is likely to find support for his work. Some two hundred supporters attended the court to listen to Hwang's words, often nodding in solemn agreement.

David Sinclair believes resveratrol is a miracle drug. He's been taking it for three years because he hopes it will help him live a healthier life, despite a lack of evidence that it works in humans \u2014 or any data on the safety of long-term exposure. But this week, Sinclair comes a step closer to proving that he's on to something. He and his colleagues report in a paper published online in  Nature 1  that this compound counteracts the ill effects of a high-fat, high-calorie diet \u2014 at least in mice. To some scientists, the finding has the whiff of a landmark discovery: it could lay the foundations for a future drug that blocks the toxic effects of obesity in humans. But how solid is that foundation? The research is certainly striking. The study was led by Sinclair, of Harvard Medical School in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and Rafael de Cabo of the National Institute on Aging in Baltimore, Maryland. Their team divided one-year-old mice into three groups. One group ate regular food. Another ate high-calorie food. The third group ate the high-calorie diet along with a daily dose of resveratrol, a chemical found in many plant species, including red grapes \u2014 and thus also red wine. After six months, all the mice fed high-calorie diets had grown fat. But after a year the mice in the resveratrol group seemed a lot healthier than their high-calorie-fed counterparts. The drug seemed to prevent these mice from developing a diabetes-like illness and liver damage, and reduced their risk of death by 30%, compared with the mice on high-calorie diets that did not get the drug. That's a potentially revolutionary finding. But for those desperate to undo the effects of years of overeating, it is a far cry from a human cure. First, the study doesn't attempt to show whether resveratrol reverses the damage caused by the toxic diet, as the mice were on the drug when they started the diet. The equivalent experiment would be to feed a human a relatively healthy diet until middle age, and then force him or her to binge on Big Macs and resveratrol simultaneously. Second, there is a dearth of data on how resveratrol works in mice \u2014 and no evidence that it works at all in humans. Sinclair believes that it triggers the same pathways as those activated by calorie-restriction diets, which have been shown to increase lifespan in some animals (but not in humans, yet). He hypothesizes that resveratrol works through proteins called sirtuins. But although there are data to prove this in yeast, worms and fruitflies, no analogous data have proved it for humans or mice \u2014 despite tantalizing hints. So it is hard to know how well resveratrol's benefits will apply in people. A third caveat is that mice on resveratrol didn't exactly mimic people on calorie-restriction diets. The mice stayed fat, for instance, and their cholesterol levels were far higher than those of mice on the standard diet. This means either that Sinclair and de Cabo decoupled obesity from its downstream ill-health effects or that resveratrol doesn't really mimic calorie restriction in mammals. Of course, the mechanism isn't so important if the drug works. But it means that, for now, experts are cautioning against the idea of rushing to an Internet pharmacy to buy resveratrol 2 . It is a dicey idea to take lifelong doses of a drug without having a clue about its mechanism of action or its long-term effects on the body. Finally, although the study itself is robust as published, the analysis involves only 121 mice, many of which are still alive \u2014 the experiment isn't truly over until all the mice have died. Further studies by the same group will look at whether resveratrol extends lifespan in the healthy mice, too. Until all these results are in, we don't really have a complete picture of the drug's effects in obese and normal mice. Even so, Sinclair is forging ahead to answer some of these questions. He is a co-founder of Cambridge-based Sirtris Pharmaceuticals, which aims to develop drugs that act on sirtuins. This summer, Sirtris tested a modified version of resveratrol in 85 healthy men. The company said on 4 October that it saw no ill effects of the drug in these volunteers, so it has now begun a clinical trial in 90 patients with diabetes. \n                     Gerontology: Eat your cake and have it \n                   \n                     Antiaging drug trials compel creative testing methods \n                   \n                     Epilepsy drug may delay ageing \n                   \n                     Red wine ingredient makes yeast live longer \n                   \n                     Live, fast, die old \n                   \n                     National Institute of Aging, Interventions Testing Program \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

How often do researchers plagiarize each other's work? The question has previously been almost impossible to answer, as no large-scale survey of the practice had been conducted. But a computer scientist has now examined more than a quarter of a million documents from a physics preprint server. The results contain the comforting news that blatant deception is rare, but suggest that minor acts of misconduct may be more common than was previously thought. Student plagiarism can often be checked using specialist databases of essays available for sale online, but plagiarism in published research is harder to police. Many publishers don't allow search engines to index the full text of their papers, so it's impossible to run electronic checks on new studies. Those small surveys that have been done revealed little evidence of plagiarism, but suggested that duplicate publications \u2014 in which a significant amount of an existing paper by the same author is reused without providing a reference to the original \u2014 could make up about 10% of the literature in some fields (see  Nature   435 , 258\u2013259; 2005). Firmer numbers can now be put on those estimates, thanks to the work of Daria Sorokina, a PhD student at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York. Sorokina's software trawled more than 280,000 entries in arXiv, a database of mainly physics, maths and computer-science preprints maintained at Cornell. Her code divides documents into seven-word chunks and looks for pairs of papers that share a suspicious number of such chunks (common phrases such as \u201cthis work was supported in part by\u201d are excluded). The result is a list of possible plagiarisms or, if the documents share a common author, duplicate publications. The search turned up 677 examples of possible plagiarism, of which Sorokina and her colleagues took a close look at 20. Only four were innocent mistakes, such as articles that quoted text from a third scientist. Three of the others were judged to be 'serious plagiarism' in which one article was essentially a copy of another, and in the others, parts of the paper such as the introduction or related work sections had been copied without appropriate references being given. If the analysis scales up, then just 0.2% of arXiv documents contain plagiarism. The results will be presented at the IEEE International Conference on Data Mining, to be held on 18\u201322 December in Hong Kong. Results for duplicates are potentially more alarming but harder to assess. Sorokina identified 30,316 pairs where one was largely a copy of the other \u2014 more than 10% of the database. But arXiv differs from journals in that researchers submit conference proceedings as well as the journal papers that are derived from them. Paul Ginsparg, a Cornell physicist who worked with Sorokina on the survey, says the \u201cvast majority\u201d of duplicates found are of this type, but adds that he was surprised at the number of student theses that included material copied verbatim from other sources. This may be the most accurate global estimate that we have for plagiarism in the scientific literature. Despite the leap forward provided by the arXiv survey, many issues remain unresolved. The survey picks up only cases where the source that has been plagiarized is also present on the arXiv database (although in many fields arXiv has near-complete coverage). And the software is unable to pick up 'intelligent plagiarism', where material copied from another author is reworded. Researchers may also behave differently when submitting to arXiv compared with peer-reviewed journals, and different rates may exist for biologists, who rarely use preprint servers. Plagiarism in biology could in principle be studied using PubMed Central, an archive of journal papers maintained by the US National Institutes of Health. Ginsparg says he has discussed this with PubMed's staff, but such a survey would currently be of limited use, as only a small fraction of papers are placed in the database after publication. Larry Claxton, a toxicologist at the US Environmental Protection Agency in North Carolina, who has studied plagiarism in the life sciences, says he would like to see a more detailed examination of the duplicates in the arXiv study before interpreting the results. But despite the limitations, he says, \u201cthis may be the most accurate global estimate that we have for plagiarism in the scientific literature\u201d. Ginsparg says he would now like arXiv to scan all new entries using Sorokina's software and alert the author in the case of suspicious overlap. The researcher would then have the option of rewriting the paper or, if they felt the overlap was justified, submitting as usual. Ginsparg says the system could be in place by the middle of next year. Preliminary discussions have also taken place with CrossRef, a publishers' group, about whether journals could work together to implement a similar scheme. \n                     Special Report: Taking on the cheats \n                   \n                     Complacency about misconduct \n                   \n                     Plagiarism in Cambridge physics lab prompts calls for guidelines \n                   \n                     ArXiv preprint server \n                   \n                     Daria Sorokina, Cornell University \n                   \n                     Paul Ginsparg, Cornell University \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

But it has upped the stakes in the debate. Jim Giles reports. He's a highly respected researcher and a former chief economist at the World Bank. He had a year and the help of more than 20 of Britain's brightest civil servants and academics. His work was commissioned by Gordon Brown, who controls Britain's budget and is likely to be the country's next prime minister. So could Nicholas Stern settle the debate about the economic impact of climate change? No chance. The  Stern Review on the Economics of Climate Change , released on 30 October, has been praised by many economists, who say it sets a new benchmark for quality and thoroughness. But its dramatic conclusions, including the claim that tackling climate change would cost 20 times less than doing nothing, were immediately attacked by right-wing commentators and other economists. Some add that the report covers such complex ground that it should be seen as a political rather than a scientific document (see Editorial,  page 2 ). Just as arguments about the validity of climate science are dying down, it seems that a new battle is looming over how much the world should spend to tackle climate change. At first glance, Stern's review provides ammunition for those who advocate tough measures. Stern predicts that if greenhouse-gas emissions carry on as normal, between 5% and 20% could be wiped off the global gross domestic product (GDP) by the beginning of the next century. \u201cThis allows us to put a dollar number on the cost of climate change for the first time,\u201d says Philip Clapp at the National Environment Trust, a not-for-profit group in Washington DC. Equally important, adds Clapp, Stern helps to counter campaigns by the oil and coal industries, which have highlighted the costs of tackling climate change. The review says that stabilizing greenhouse-gas concentrations at roughly double pre-industrial levels would cost a relatively paltry 1% of GDP, so it provides strong support for measures such as mandatory emission limits and public investment in green technologies. The key message is that acting now will cost far less than acting later. The report has prompted some alarmist headlines, with one British newspaper declaring \u201cAct now or the world we know will be lost forever\u201d. Yet the methodology used is first-rate, say supporters. Estimating costs over decades, and trying to factor in social and economic changes that will take place, is enormously tricky. But the report contains a comprehensive meta-analysis of existing studies on mitigation costs. It also includes new results from a model that builds on the handful of previous studies that have tried to calculate the impact on global GDP. \n               Inevitable criticism \n             The upper bound of 20% for loss of GDP, which is higher than previous estimates, is due to several factors. Stern generally uses low numbers for discount rates, the parameter used by economists to compare future and current costs. His team also considered a range of values for climate sensitivity \u2014 the global temperature rise caused by a given increase in greenhouse gas concentrations. Using a range leads to the higher upper limit for GDP reduction, but the results are more realistic. \u201cThis is unquestionably head and shoulders above previous economic assessments,\u201d says Michael Grubb, an energy economist at Imperial College London, who contributed to the review. But others have homed in on the many assumptions that had to be made. Many right-wing commentators attacked the review on these grounds, some even starting work before publication. The use of one global development scenario, in which population reaches what demographers say is an unrealistic figure of 15 billion, attracted criticism. Economists were also quick off the mark. In a four-page critique compiled within hours of the review's publication, economist Richard Tol of Princeton University accused Stern of selective reporting: \u201cFor water, agriculture, health and insurance, the Stern Review consistently selects the most pessimistic study in the literature.\u201d On sea-level rise, for example, Tol says the review underplays the role of better coastal defences. Roger Pielke Jr, an expert in climate-change policy at the University of Colorado, Boulder, also accuses Stern of \u201ccherry picking\u201d alarming results from the literature on the link between natural disasters and climate change. Such criticisms come as no surprise to Mike Hulme, director of the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research in Norwich, UK. Hulme says that the British government has asked him many times to conduct a study on the total cost of climate change. He declined, as he does not feel it's a question that researchers can answer. Difficulties in estimating the impact of strategies such as coastal defences are only part of the problem. When other assumptions, such as the economic cost of species extinctions, are included, Hulme feels that the uncertainties become so great that he would not be able to defend the end result. He says that Stern's team seems to have done a good job, but with so many assumptions involved, and the review having been conducted by a political appointee: \u201cThis is not the last word of scientists and economists, it's the last word of civil servants.\u201d \n               Trillion-dollar questions \n             An academic involved in the Stern review, who did not want to be named as he was speaking on behalf of the team, told  Nature  that each assumption is based on the \u201csound principles of science and economics\u201d and that the review spells out how the uncertainties affect the final result. He adds that the involvement of civil servants does not justify the \u201cdangerous and incorrect\u201d allegation that the report is politicized: \u201cThere was never any political pressure to produce high numbers.\u201d The inevitable criticisms of the review need not reduce its impact. Negotiations over the future of the Kyoto Protocol are taking place this week (see  'Kyoto looks to the future' ), and the review will strengthen the case of countries like Britain, which want tough limits on future emissions. Stern discusses several ways in which this could be done; one suggestion, that the current European Union emission-trading scheme be made global, was backed by Brown at the review's launch. Stern also notes that a substantial hike in public energy-research spending is needed, as market factors alone will not drive the development of technologies such as improved solar cells and biofuels that are needed to reduce emissions. Stimulating debate over spending decisions, rather than putting a figure on the true costs of climate change, may be the review's main legacy. Although Hulme questions the assumptions behind the headline result, he has no doubt that Stern is broadly correct: \u201cIn a sense it's neither here nor there whether you believe the numbers. This will take the discourse away from the costs of taking action and put attention onto the costs of inaction.\u201d \n                 See Editorial, page 884; News & Views, page 919. \n               \n                     Putting the carbon back: The hundred billion tonne challenge \n                   \n                     Carbon credits for the Joneses \n                   \n                     Economists claim carbon cuts won't break the world's bank \n                   \n                     The costs of global warming \n                   \n                     Emissions trading: The carbon game \n                   \n                     Climate modellers go local to target California's politicians \n                   \n                     Regional climate change special \n                   \n                     Climate change in focus \n                   \n                     MIT Joint Program on Science and Policy of Global Change \n                   \n                     Stanford University Global Climate Energy Project \n                   \n                     United Nation's Framework Convention on climate change \n                   \n                     IPCC \n                   \n                     Stern Review \n                   \n                     Roger Pielke Jr's comments on Stern Review \n                   \n                     Stern Review \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Could an insect help us understand why some people are daredevils, or why others are overweight? Scientists who have sequenced and analysed the genome of the western honeybee  Apis mellifera  say it might. The sequence, released in this week's  Nature  (see  page 931 ), is already aiding the young field of sociogenomics \u2014 the search for the genetic underpinnings of social life. Researchers have shown some examples of how genes, the environment and behaviour can influence \u2014 and be influenced by \u2014 social interactions. Implanting one gene, for example, can change voles from promiscuous to monogamous (M. M. Lim  et al .  Nature   429 , 754\u2013757; 2004). And maternal care from rats helps pups to express genes that make them less susceptible to stress as adults (I. C. G. Weaver  et al .  Nature Neurosci.   7 , 847\u2013854; 2004). But, besides its economic importance (see  'Pollinators in peril' ), the honeybee is the lodestone of social biology. \u201cEverything they do is social,\u201d says Charles Whitfield, an entomologist and molecular biologist at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. The colony dynamic determines a bee's diet, work and sex life, making bees ideal for studying some aspects of social biology, say scientists. Researchers are also releasing a tool set for analysing the genome, including an improved microarray of honeybee genes and a list of DNA variations called single nucleotide polymorphisms. Scientists hope to use these tools to find the genetic causes of social traits \u2014 such as the bees' dance language and the division of labour in the hive. \u201cWe have so many behaviours in the bee for which we don't have any clue about the mechanism,\u201d Whitfield says. The genome is helping to reveal some of those mechanisms. For instance, there are 65 spots in the genome that seem to code for short RNA molecules called microRNAs (miRNAs), molecular switches that can turn genes on or off. The researchers found that miRNA activity differs between bees doing different jobs. Such work starts to show how gene regulation gives the bee such a different lifestyle from, for example, the fruitfly, with which it shares many genes. \u201cAt the level of the brain, the parts list is pretty much the same as the fruitfly, yet there are these radical differences in behaviour and social organization,\u201d says George Weinstock, a genome biologist at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, Texas. \u201cThat makes you think that regulation is probably more important than the parts list.\u201d So, what does this have to do with people? Primate behaviour specialists say that there are parallels between honeybee and human societies. For instance, some individuals in each care for youngsters who aren't their offspring. But, cautions anthropologist Sarah Blaffer Hrdy of the University of California, Davis, honeybees and humans have many differences. \u201cAnyone interested in the cognitive or emotional bases of cooperation should stick with other primates, or at the very least other social mammals,\u201d Hrdy says. \u201cThe relevance of honeybee genomes would depend very much on the sort of questions one is asking. Bee researchers say there could be links between human and bee behaviour. For instance, some bees seek out food sources, others wait and follow on. It's possible that scouts have the same sort of novelty-seeking genetic pathways that predispose some humans to become bungee jumpers. \u201cOne of the lessons of developmental biology is just how conserved gene function is in building complex phenotypes\u201d such as social behaviours, says Gene Robinson at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Some even see a link to human health. Worker bees make queens by feeding larvae a protein-rich substance called royal jelly. Understanding how the jelly reprogrammes genes might tell us more about how humans get fat, says molecular biologist Ryszard Maleszka at the Australian National University in Canberra. \u201cSome of the insights we gain from following this protein family might be useful for probing a major problem in human society: obesity.\u201d \n                 See Editorial, page 884; News & Views, page 919. \n               \n                     Plan bee \n                   \n                     Bees' genes match their jobs \n                   \n                     Honeybee sex gene discovered \n                   \n                     Bees go with the flow \n                   \n                     Bad news for bees \n                   \n                     BeeSpace \n                   \n                     Charlie Whitfield, University of California \n                   \n                     The Robinson Laboratory \n                   \n                     National Academies report on pollinators \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

With the defendants facing possible execution, Declan Butler asked AIDS experts to assess the case against them. A scientific report being used in the case against six foreign medical workers facing the death penalty in Libya is nothing but conjecture and supposition, say international experts. The evidence, commissioned from Libyan medics, has bolstered the charge that the six knowingly infected more than 400 children with HIV at the Al-Fateh Hospital in Benghazi in 1998. The court has denied requests by defence lawyers to hear evidence from international experts. Instead, five Libyan physicians testified in August that they stand by the conclusions of their 2003 report, commissioned by the court in an earlier trial, and on 29 August the prosecution called for the medics to be given the death penalty. The trial is due to end on 31 October (see  'Countdown to a verdict' ). With a guilty verdict looking likely,  Nature  obtained an English translation of the Libyan report, which has been key to the prosecution's case, and asked leading international experts to assess it. \u201cI don't see any evidence in it,\u201d says Janine Jagger, an epidemiologist and MacArthur fellow who heads the International Health Care Worker Safety Center at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville. \u201cIt wouldn't meet the lowest standards of epidemiological evidence for establishing any causal relationship.\u201d In 2003, the court also ordered a report from Luc Montagnier, who discovered the AIDS virus and is president of the World Foundation for AIDS Research and Prevention, and Vittorio Colizzi, an AIDS researcher at Rome's Tor Vergata University. They concluded that the infections were caused by poor hospital hygiene, and started before the medics arrived in Libya (see  \u201cMontagnier and Colizzi's conclusions\u201d ). But the court threw out this report, on the grounds that the Libyan panel had reached the opposite conclusion. The panel had dismissed the external report as \u201chypothetical\u201d and \u201clacking precision\u201d. \n               'That's tosh' \n             \u201cThe [Libyan] report refutes the Montagnier and Colizzi report on the grounds that there is no written record of the reuse of injecting equipment, and a blank denial that indwelling catheters were ever used,\u201d says Robin Weiss, an AIDS virologist at University College London. \u201cIt wrongly turns lack of evidence into evidence of absence.\u201d The report argues that HIV and hospital hygiene were not a problem in Libya (the prosecution describes the Al-Fateh Hospital as a \u201cmodel\u201d) and that the outbreak is so large that deliberate, malicious infection of HIV cannot be excluded. \u201cI don't agree with that statement,\u201d says Weiss. \u201cAnd even if I did, it does not amount to sufficient evidence to incriminate the accused medical staff.\u201d The Libyan report also suggests that because the genetic sequence of the Benghazi HIV strain is different from any lodged in public databases, there are grounds for suspecting foul play. \u201cThat's tosh,\u201d says Weiss. Montagnier agrees, pointing out that the virus was a new natural recombinant of a highly infectious strain common in Central and West Africa, which has replaced most other strains in the region over the past few years. In contrast, Weiss describes Montagnier andColizzi's report as excellent. \u201cColizzi has done a really superb job in difficult circumstances,\u201d he says. After studying both reports, Weiss concludes: \u201cThere are no grounds for suspicion of deliberate infection by any staff, and strong evidence of hospital-acquired infection before the arrival, and after the departure, of the Palestinian physician and the Bulgarian nurses.\u201d \n               'Completely inadequate' \n             Jagger, an expert in occupational exposures to blood-borne pathogens, says she is astonished that the medics were even arrested, given the flimsiness of the prosecution's scientific evidence. In this sort of case, she says the minimum standard should be a thorough field study that tracks all medical procedures carried out during the outbreak, and calculates attack rates, epidemic curves and other standard epidemiology measures for inferring cause. She describes the Libyan data as \u201ccompletely inadequate\u201d. To firmly establish any cause, a case-control study should also have been done, Jagger adds, comparing risk factors and medical procedures used between the HIV-infected patients and a similar uninfected group to try and explain transmission. \u201cInexcusably, there has been no attempt by Libyan officials to conduct an epidemiological study that could establish a causal link between the infected patients and individual care givers.\u201d Luc Perrin, a clinical virologist at Geneva University Hospital in Switzerland, who has treated many of the infected children, describes the Libyan report as \u201ca lot of generalities that are not always correct\u201d. The report also fails to provide any evidence for its assertion that HIV infection has not been seen in children at other Libyan hospitals, he says. Perrin is an expert on primary HIV infection. He has analysed samples from 148 of the infected children, collected in September 1998, and has obtained further data on 37 of them and 46 of their parents, when they were treated in Switzerland. Perrin says his genetic data support Colizzi's analysis, and that many of the 1998 samples have protein profiles corresponding to infections well over a year old: \u201cI can tell for sure that the HIV infection cases occurred before September 1997 and the first cases most likely before 1996.\u201d The accused medics first arrived in Libya in March 1998. The Libyan report is also silent on the prevalence of hepatitis at Al-Fateh Hospital and other Libyan hospitals, notes Perrin \u2014 who found that half of the HIV-infected children were also infected with hepatitis B or C. He says these high levels \u201cclearly indicate\u201d that the children were exposed to infection via contaminated blood or other medical material. Moreover, many of the children were infected with several subtypes of hepatitis, suggesting they were exposed to hospital contamination on multiple occasions, possibly when receiving vaccination injections. \u201cIf a single source of contaminated blood had caused the HIV outbreak, all the children would be infected by the same hepatitis C subtype,\u201d says Perrin. \u201cWhat we observed can [instead] be explained by the reuse of syringes or poor sterilization procedures.\u201d Perrin believes the most likely scenario is that a child who was infected with HIV in Al-Fateh in 1997 or earlier, returned to the hospital in 1998. \u201cThe child now is highly infectious, so poor medical procedures or sterilization procedures will rapidly translate into a number of new HIV infections.\u201d \n               'Sinister legacy' \n             Perrin was commissioned to write reports for the Libyan government in 2000 and 2001, and for President Muammar Gaddafi in 2004, but says that they received no response. \u201cIt is strange that I was asked by the World Health Organization representative of Libya to investigate, and received a grant for that, that I sent the reports accordingly and finally the report is not considered,\u201d he says. Testimony he submitted to the court was also rejected, he adds. The purported 'smoking gun' in the Libyan report is the detection of HIV antibodies in vials allegedly found at one of the nurses' homes during a raid in 1999, but not tested until 2003. Both Montagnier and Colizzi have seen the results of a western blot, a test to detect proteins: they are \u201cindeterminate\u201d, says Montagnier. \u201cThey say nothing,\u201d adds Colizzi. In 2002 Libya promised that they could test the samples independently, but neither has ever been given access. Even a positive test could detect only antibodies to HIV. It would not show that the vials had contained the virus, points out Massimo Amicosante, a biologist also at Tor Vergata. \u201cThis is one of the main weak and controversial points of the Libyan report,\u201d he says. Finding the virus would require testing for HIV RNA, which has not been done. After reviewing the evidence, experts are in no doubt as to the consequences of a guilty verdict. \u201cIf the accused are found guilty, it will be a travesty of justice,\u201d says Weiss. \u201cMoreover, it would be foolhardy for any expatriate healthcare worker, whether from the Arab world or elsewhere, to work in Libya.\u201d Jagger's conclusions are similar: \u201cThere is a shocking lack of evidence in this case,\u201d she says. \u201cThe Libyan government stands to carry out an act that would not be forgotten by the international healthcare community. Such a horrific humanitarian tragedy would stand for ever as a sinister legacy of the Libyan government.\u201d \n                     Forgotten plights \n                   \n                     Protests mount against Libyan trial \n                   \n                     Bloggers rally for liberation of the 'Tripoli Six' \n                   \n                     Libya's travesty \n                   \n                     Lawyers call for science to clear AIDS nurses in Libya \n                   \n                     AIDS medics in Libya web focus \n                   \n                     Nature Newsblog: Comment on the case \n                   \n                     Montagnier and Vittorio Final Report \n                   \n                     Final Report by The National Experts Committee Regarding The Scientific Expert Opinion \n                   \n                     Outbreak of Multiple Bloodborne Viral Infections \n                   \n                     U.

Washington DC Now that North Korea has joined the nuclear club, the United States is intent on preventing it from extending membership perks to others. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice visited the region last week to meet leaders from neighbouring countries and discuss ways to detect and intercept illicit nuclear stocks. But proliferation experts disagree about whether such a screening regime is practical or even possible. Spotting radioactive material aboard ships, trucks and aircraft is technically difficult and would require unprecedented regional cooperation. North Korea's nuclear test on 9 October (see  Nature   443 , 883\u2013884; 2006 10.1038/443883b ) renewed fears about nuclear proliferation. Last week, Mohamed ElBaradei, head of the United Nations' nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, warned that another 20 to 30 states could soon have the capacity to develop nuclear weapons. A particular concern is that North Korea might smuggle nuclear material to other states or terrorist groups, says Michael Burns, principal deputy for threat reduction at Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico. Burns says that before leaving for her trip, Rice's team consulted Los Alamos on the possibility of detecting nuclear materials leaving North Korea. Detection is possible, says Burns, but only by integrating a lot of information: \u201cDetection of nuclear material needs a systems-wide approach.\u201d The most important tactic will be to create bottlenecks for goods travelling in and out of North Korea. These ports and border crossings will then need a variety of detection equipment. Passive detectors catch flashes of gamma radiation from the decay products of uranium or plutonium, or neutrons from the decay of certain radioactive isotopes, notably plutonium-240. In addition, active detectors use X-rays or neutrons to scan shipping containers and trucks for dense masses. \u201cThat will be an immediate indication to a customs agent to take it aside and look at it by eye,\u201d says Burns. If nuclear material were found entering or leaving the country, it would also be important to establish where it came from \u2014 which is difficult without international cooperation, says Burns: \u201cWe have to establish information-sharing through diplomatic channels.\u201d One proposal is to create an international database of nuclear samples (see description on  page 907 ). It's hoped that the ability to trace the origin of illicit stocks would also deter states from selling their nuclear material. But others disagree about whether such a detection scheme could work. \u201cIt's not feasible,\u201d says Steve Fetter, dean of public policy at the University of Maryland in College Park. \u201cThe problem is that the radiation signature from the nuclear materials you use in weapons is quite small.\u201d It would be relatively easy to shield the radiation with lead, plastic and other materials, he says. Gaining access to North Korean cargo is also complicated. \u201cThis is not something you can do from a mile away,\u201d Fetter says. \u201cYou have to get as close as possible.\u201d Daniel Pinkston, director of the East Asia non-proliferation programme at the Monterey Institute of International Studies in California, agrees, adding that borders are porous and difficult to monitor. \u201cAnd boarding ships on the high seas is basically an act of war.\u201d Beyond the technical difficulties, Pinkston thinks North Korea would be unlikely to surrender its limited plutonium stocks. \u201cWhy would North Korea give up its fissile material? It's priceless to them,\u201d he says. A more real concern, he believes, is that North Korea may export nuclear knowledge: \u201cData sets or design plans can't be interdicted at all.\u201d Burns declined to comment on the ability to detect nuclear material remotely, but says he believes a perimeter around North Korea can be built. \u201cNothing is 100% effective,\u201d he says. \u201cBut a system that increases our confidence that we are deterring the movement of nuclear material can be established.\u201d \n                     Rich in plutonium \n                   \n                     Chasing the bomb \n                   \n                     A global folly \n                   \n                     The fizzle heard around the world \n                   \n                     North Korean blast seems small for a nuke \n                   \n                     Nuclear Proliferation Special \n                   \n                     US state department briefing \n                   \n                     Los Alamos National Laboratory \n                   \n                     US statement on North Korea's test \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Seven thousand fewer people showed up at this year's Society for Neuroscience meeting than last year. That still left 21,000 researchers attending one of the most popular conferences in biomedicine. But hallway gossip swirled around one possible cause for the drop-off \u2014 money, in the form of grants from the US National Institutes of Health (NIH). \u201cDollars come to mind,\u201d says Jeffrey Rothstein, a neurologist at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland. \u201cThe field has expanded and we now have less money per person.\u201d Rothstein's comments explain an apparent paradox: the annual budget for the NIH doubled between 1998 and 2003, and now stands at $28.6 billion. But many researchers are finding it far more difficult to win grants. This is because universities invested hugely in infrastructure and workforce once the doubling began, which led to an explosive growth in grant applications. In 1998, the NIH received 24,000 grant applications; this year the number is 46,000 and is forecast to reach 49,000 in 2007. Two other metrics have also changed, helping to create the perfect storm. Average grant sizes have grown by 40% since the doubling began, from $275,000 in 1998 to $400,000 today; and Congress has stopped increasing the NIH budget. So the agency's buying power has fallen in real terms by 5.5% since the doubling ended in 2004. \u201cNobody's bottom-line model showed funding decreasing after the doubling. We were talking about modest increases, not the floor falling out,\u201d says Tony Mazzaschi of the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) in Washington DC. In a speech at the neuroscience meeting, NIH institute heads acknowledged the inevitable outcome: the success rate for grant applications across the agency dropped from 31% in 1998 to 23% last year (see graph). Next year, this is expected to fall to 19%. \u201cWe have really good grants that we can't afford to pay,\u201d says Story Landis, head of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke. \u201cThe demand took off just as the NIH budget was landing.\u201d With Congress highly unlikely to hand the NIH another significant increase in the near future, researchers and agency officials are considering how to adjust the funding system. Some are dubious that much pain can be avoided. \u201cI personally don't see a terribly satisfying solution,\u201d says David Korn, former dean of the Stanford University School of Medicine in California and a top official at the AAMC who has studied the issue extensively. Elias Zerhouni, the NIH director, is battling to counter that notion with a number of short-term strategies, especially for first-time applicants and those fighting to get expiring grants renewed. \u201cMy main concern is the individual investigator whose lab might close because of the gap in funding,\u201d he says. This year, Zerhouni cut all existing grants by 2.35%, to free up money for new grants and grants competing for renewal. He will also use funds from expiring grants to gain a 3% boost in the number of new and competing grants awarded next year. For some, these measures will be too little, too late. Rothstein says that he may have to lose staff and is already seeing \u201cpruning\u201d in other labs. His brother Jay, a cancer researcher at Thomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, will quit for the pharmaceutical company Amgen early next year, in part because of the struggle to get funding. He notes that few graduate students at his university plan to remain in academia: \u201cPeople see how hard it is to run a lab.\u201d After the NIH presentation at the neuroscience meeting, Peter Cariani spoke up. He studied spinal-cord regeneration at Tufts Medical School in Boston, Massachusetts, until his lab ran out of funding two months ago. He won applause for suggesting that the NIH should \u201cmake it harder for the rich to get progressively richer\u201d. Like others present, he feels that big labs hoover up too many grants, forcing teams like his out of the game. He wants the criteria for second and subsequent grants to be set higher than for an initial application. Zerhouni cautions that such proposals put key research decisions into the wrong hands. \u201cIt would be very dangerous to dictate by bureaucratic fiat that somebody who is meritorious should not be funded because they have a grant or two. The peer reviewers are smart enough to know if someone is being overfunded or not.\u201d He hopes scientists will stick out the hard times: \u201cWe still have the largest research budget on Earth: $28.6 billion is larger than all other countries combined. If you believe in your research, don't give up on it. Things are not great. But they are not as desperate as some people portray them to be.\u201d \n                     New rules propose greater scrutiny for NIH grant recipients \n                   \n                     Early success claimed for Zerhouni's NIH roadmap \n                   \n                     NIH privatization push compromising science, critics warn \n                   \n                     New NIH project could be road to ruin for basic research \n                   \n                     Medical research news channel \n                   \n                     Elias Zerhouni's NIH page \n                   \n                     Neuroscience 2006 \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

If hopes of colonizing the Moon are ever to become reality, water needs to be found there. Sizeable amounts of ice could provide Moon-dwellers with drinking water and, if they split it into its atomic components, hydrogen for fuel and oxygen to breathe. If lunar water is scarce, colonizers would have to carry water and fuel with them from Earth, or perhaps extract hydrogen from the rocks, either of which could be hugely expensive. But a paper published in  Nature  this week (see  page 835 ) strengthens the argument that radar data previously interpreted as showing ice could reveal nothing more than rough ground. The Shackleton crater at the Moon's south pole is a good place to look for deposits of water ice, because parts of it are in permanent shadow from the Sun and so perpetually frozen. Areas of the crater's rim are in permanent sunlight; together these factors make it a good candidate for a lunar base. But scientists have argued for a decade about whether there is really ice in the crater. The evidence for Shackleton containing ice deposits is based on the fact that radar signals reflected off the crater are polarized the same way as the incoming pulse (called a high circular polarization ratio, or CPR) \u2014 a property of ice. Rough surfaces have the same effect, but the Moon has few rough areas, because apart from young features such as recent impact craters, the surface has been sandblasted to a fine dust. But astronomer Donald Campbell, of Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, has never bought this argument. Now he has gathered the highest-resolution radar images made of the Moon so far, and claims that they dash hopes of finding large lumps of ice at Shackleton. Campbell and his colleagues sent radar signals from the Arecibo radio telescope in Puerto Rico to the Moon, and captured the reflections using the Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope in West Virginia. Campbell says that Shackleton shows the same pattern of high CPR as the similarly shaped Schomberger crater \u2014 which is dried out by sunlight. Campbell also found similar patterns in the walls and floors of other young craters. So, he argues, the signal from Shackleton is probably caused by rough rocks. Campbell did see some evidence of ice at Shackleton, but as dispersed particles in loose rock, not as lumps. He urges those planning Moon missions to take his findings into account. \u201cPlanning for future bases on the Moon should be predicated on there being low concentrations of water ice,\u201d he says. Predictably for such a long-running debate, not everyone agrees. \u201cDon sees one thing and says 'no ice'. I see the same thing and say 'maybe ice',\u201d says planetary geologist Paul Spudis of the Lunar and Planetary Institute in Houston, Texas. Spudis has believed there is ice on the Moon since the 1994 Clementine mission found high CPR in dark polar regions of the Moon. In 1998, spectrometers on NASA's Lunar Prospector found high levels of hydrogen in the same areas, again suggesting the presence of ice. Spudis disagrees that the radar signals from Shackleton and Schomberger craters are the same: \u201cThose patterns look different to me.\u201d The CPR signal from Schomberger weakens as the crater deepens, consistent with roughness at its rim, Spudis says, whereas the signal at Shackleton starts halfway down the crater and continues deeper in, as might be expected from ice deposits (see Figure 2,  page 837 ). Spudis is involved with NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO), set to launch in October 2008, which aims to provide a more detailed map of the Moon. In April, NASA announced that the mission would also include a probe that, by crashing into the Moon, might clear up the ice debate. The probe will split in two, with cameras and a spectrometer on the upper stage recording and analysing the plume of material produced by the lower stage's impact with the Moon. The rest of the probe will crash into the Moon 15 minutes later. A strong signal of water vapour from the impact could confirm the presence of ice. But an absence of water vapour is unlikely to end the debate, as Spudis argues that the probe could simply hit a dry patch. The only way to find out for sure will be to land on the Moon and take a sample, says Spudis. Bernard Foing, project scientist on the European Space Agency's Smart-1 lunar orbiter \u2014 which ended its three-year mission by crashing into the Moon on 3 September \u2014 agrees, and is lobbying hard for the agency to develop a lunar lander that could be launched by 2012. \n                     Moon mission ends with a bang \n                   \n                     Lunar probe ready to bite the dust \n                   \n                     Taking a pop at the Moon \n                   \n                     Five times more water on Moon? \n                   \n                     Moon special \n                   \n                     Human space flight In Focus \n                   \n                     Donald Campbell, Cornell University \n                   \n                     Lunar prospector mission \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

The company whose experimental drug left six volunteers critically ill failed to provide regulatory authorities with relevant data before the trial, claim two experts. They say a checklist could help to ensure more rigorous risk assessment for future applications, especially given the increasing popularity of drugs that act on the immune system. The antibody, called TGN1412, activates the immune system's T cells, and was being developed by the German company TeGenero. But in the first human tests on 13 March, it triggered a dangerous over-reaction of the immune system called a cytokine storm. The agency responsible for approving the trial, the UK Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), concluded that this was caused by an unexpected biological effect of the drug. Now two drug-safety specialists who have investigated the case say relevant information about TGN1412 that might have raised a red flag was missing from the file TeGenero gave the MHRA and other authorities (M. Kenter and A. Cohen  Lancet   368,  1387\u20131391; 2006). \u201cIf assessors had known, they probably would have started asking questions,\u201d says Marcel Kenter, executive director of the Central Committee on Research Involving Human Subjects in The Hague, Netherlands, which also assesses drugs for clinical trials. His co-author is Adam Cohen of the Centre for Human Drug Research in Leiden. Kenter and Cohen identified several key pieces of data that were absent from TeGenero's file. For example, they say that tests in mice given a humanized immune system had shown that the antibody caused T-cell numbers to decline, perhaps because they were so fired up they committed suicide. These data were published online in early March by researchers, including those at TeGenero (N. Legrand  et al .  Blood   108,  238\u2013245; 2006). The authors also say the company failed to mention key differences between the amino-acid sequence of the antibody receptor in rhesus monkeys on which the drug was initially tested and the human sequence. The differences might have suggested that the antibody would bind more strongly to human than to monkey cells, and perhaps cause a more severe reaction. Thomas Hanke, chief scientific officer at now-insolvent TeGenero, says all relevant information was given to the MHRA before the trial. Although some of TeGenero's studies were carried out in rhesus monkeys, he says the company used cynomolgus monkeys for toxicological studies because the antibody-receptor sequence of the cynomolgus monkey is identical to the human one. The MHRA says that at the time of TeGenero's application, senior assessors judged the data submitted to be adequate. But in a preliminary July report into the incident, an expert scientific group recommended that rules for such phase I clinical studies be tightened to improve the safety of volunteers. The Paul Ehrlich Institute in Langen, Germany, had also approved an application from TeGenero to carry out a similar trial. Its president, Johannes L\u00f6wer, says assessors there did ask TeGenero for additional information during the approval process and received it. \u201cI'm not sure [a company] is obliged to include these data but they did provide them, so they were thinking about the their relevance,\u201d he says. Kenter and Cohen recommend that regulatory bodies such as the MHRA adopt a checklist during risk assessments to ensure that they have all the information on a drug's mechanism of action and the effects of human exposure to similar agents. L\u00f6wer agrees, and says the Ehrlich Institute already operates a similar checklist, but that other agencies, with less expertise in basic research, might not. TGN1412 is thought to be an exceptional case. Even so, Kenter says the lessons are particularly important because of the increasing number of drugs that are designed to work specifically in humans and so may have side effects that are difficult to predict from animal trials. \n                     Verdict confirms fate of 'elephant man' drug volunteers \n                   \n                     Can super-antibody drugs be tamed? \n                   \n                     British trial disaster casts doubts on testing guidelines \n                   \n                     London's disastrous drug trial has serious side effects for research \n                   \n                     MHRA Clinical Trial Report \n                   \n                     DoH Expert Scientific Group on phase one clinical trials \n                   \n                     Paul Ehrlich Institute GNA1412 Q&A \n                   \n                     TeGenero \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Since the success of the initial Ansari X Prize competition to create a reusable private spacecraft, technology competitions are popping up everywhere, offering millions of dollars in prizes. So can such financial incentives really revolutionize a field? Supporters say they can, but forget about the money \u2014 the real prize is publicity. This week's X Prize Cup, scheduled to begin on 20 October, is the latest instalment. The two-day festival in the New Mexico desert will feature three competitions, including a NASA-sponsored lunar-lander contest and more than US$2.5 million in prize money. NASA has issued a series of challenges to improve everything from elements of the proposed space elevator to the gloves that astronauts wear in space. And the US House of Representatives recently passed a bill to create the H Prize, complete with a $10-million reward, to encourage the development of technology for hydrogen-powered vehicles. \u201cWe were directly inspired by the X prize,\u201d says Congressman Bob Inglis (Republican, South Carolina), who sponsored the H Prize bill. Meanwhile, the X Prize Foundation has announced its own latest challenge, offering $10 million to the first private team to sequence 100 human genomes in 10 days. The Archon X Prize for Genomics, launched on 4 October, is meant to stimulate technology that will bring down the cost and time of sequencing, accelerating the development of personalized medicine tailored to individual genomic attributes. As with the first X prize, those chasing the genomics award will probably invest much more than $10 million. The true pot of gold is not cash, but publicity and a head start at grabbing a slice of a growing market. \u201cThe prize is really not the X prize,\u201d says Steve Lombardi, senior vice-president of marketing at Helicos BioSciences, a sequencing company based in Cambridge, Massachusetts. \u201cIt's that this is going to put these sorts of ideas in front of the general public.\u201d Inglis agrees, adding that he hopes private contributions will boost his H prize to $50 million: \u201cI think having a more substantial prize makes it more interesting to the public.\u201d The details of the latest X prize diverge somewhat from the model established by the first competition. That was created to fill a clear hole in the private sector, but personalized medicine has been receiving media attention for years. The genome-sequencing industry is littered with companies large and small, and venture capital has already shown an interest in advanced sequencing technology. For the past two years, the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) has been funding 'revolutionary' sequencing programmes with the aim of one day developing technology to sequence individual genomes for only $1,000. \n               Geniuses and mavericks \n             Kathleen Wiltsey, executive director of the Archon X prize, acknowledges that a sequencing industry already exists, but says it still needs the stimulation the prize would bring: \u201cGiven the scale of the task and all the directions this can take, the industry is really underscaled for the demand.\u201d The prize will also capture the interest of people who weren't necessarily thinking about sequencing before, she adds. \u201cThe idea of the prize draws a lot of attention. It draws geniuses and mavericks out of the woodwork.\u201d George Church, director of the Lipper Center for Computational Genetics at Harvard Medical School in Boston, Massachusetts, who is on the advisory board for the Archon prize, thinks the winner will probably be someone from an established company that has deep pockets. \u201cEverybody who's serious about itis already getting NIH money or venture capital,\u201d he says. But some are more optimistic about attracting attention. \u201cI think it will encourage people to enter this field,\u201d says Amit Meller, a bioengineer at Boston University who has been trying for nine years to use nanotechnology to speed up sequencing. \u201cThere are many others out there who are working quietly, and now they may start to be more aggressive.\u201d One point everyone agrees on is the power of the X-prize model to focus public attention on the social and political issues surrounding a field. For the H prize, that means energy policy, says Inglis; for the latest X prize, it's how to interpret and protect genomic information. Francis Collins, director of the US National Human Genome Research Institute, has seized this opportunity to voice his concerns about protecting the privacy of genomic information. Genomics entrepreneur Craig Venter, on the other hand, has used his time in the spotlight to talk about the need to educate the public about the fallacy of genetic determinism. Church adds that other industries will also start thinking about how to capitalize on the coming flood of genomic sequences. \u201cThis will make downstream users start thinking about it ahead of time,\u201d says Church. \u201cIt's like having a contest for Internet browsers back in 1992.\u201d \n                     Sequencers step up to the speed challenge \n                   \n                     Royal Society puts personalized medicine in perspective \n                   \n                     Genetics blog \n                   \n                     Omics gateway \n                   \n                     X Prize for Genomics website \n                   \n                     NIH $1,000 genome announcement \n                   \n                     National Human Genome Research Institute \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

It is one of the most politically charged questions that any researcher can tackle: how many people have died in Iraq since the US-led invasion? Four public-health experts provided an answer last week. Their result \u2014 a death rate that has risen from 5.5 per thousand per year to 13.3 \u2014 implies that since the invasion there have been 650,000 'excess' deaths, 2.5% of the population. Predictably, the finding has met with criticism from supporters of the war from the US president downwards. If it holds, the study will be a key publication in the growing field of conflict epidemiology. Understanding who is dying, how and where in Iraq is vital for efforts to rebuild the country. So once the political criticisms are set aside, how does the study stack up scientifically? Estimates of deaths in Iraq all suggest that the death rate has risen since the invasion. But they have been much lower than the latest figure. Iraq Body Count, a left-leaning website that compiles deaths from media reports, quotes a maximum of just under 49,000. US government officials have given figures of 30,000\u201350,000. And a household survey, conducted in May 2004 by the United Nations and published last year, concluded that the war had caused at least 18,000\u201329,000 deaths, mostly from violent causes. The only previous estimate of the same order of magnitude is a figure of around 100,000 excess deaths in the first 18 months of the conflict, published in 2004 by Gilbert Burnham and his colleagues at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore (L. Roberts  et al .  Lancet   364,  1857\u20131864; 2004), the same researchers who are behind the new work. The authors say their estimate is so much higher because their methodology is more comprehensive. They organized detailed interviews, carried out by Iraqi researchers from the Al Mustansiriya University in Baghdad, in more than 1,800 households in 16 of Iraq's 18 administrative regions. Using random sampling similar to that used in political opinion polls, they documented 82 deaths in the period before the invasion, and 547 during the conflict. More than 90% of these were confirmed by death certificates. They show a 95% probability that the death toll has been between 390,000 and 940,000, most of which were due to violence such as gunshots (G. Burnham  et al .  Lancet  doi:10.1016/S0140-6736(06)69491-9; 2006). Data from other conflicts show that such sampling is much more accurate than media reports, which usually account for no more than 20% of deaths. \u201cRandom counts force you to go to places that aren't convenient,\u201d says Jana Asher, a researcher with the Science and Human Rights Program of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in Washington DC. \u201cThe media don't wander off to distant locations. It's a very different type of data collection.\u201d Death tolls from Iraqi health officials, the source of US government figures, are also suspect. The Johns Hopkins team says that the process for issuing death certificates still works well in Iraq, but the system for monitoring the number of certificates issued does not. Even before the war, note the researchers, the government's surveillance system captured only one-third of all deaths. Yet despite the weakness of other measurements, the new figure has still surprised researchers. Perhaps the most significant concern is the baseline rate for pre-invasion death rates used in the new study. The latest survey, which included questions about the situation before the invasion, put this at 5.5 deaths per 1,000 people per year, in line with figures on Iraq from the US Census Bureau. Iran, which has a well-run health system, has a similar rate, but Iraq was at the time suffering from years of sanctions. Some sources, including the United Nations Population Division, list a pre-invasion figure of 9.7. The discrepancy does not invalidate the new result, and if the researchers underestimated the pre-war death rate, it's possible that they may have also underestimated the post-war rate. But some researchers say the paper should have addressed the issue. \u201cThere should have been more introspection,\u201d says Beth Osborne Daponte, a demographer at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. \u201cThat increased my discomfort.\u201d Other researchers share that discomfort. Debarati Guha-Sapir is director of the Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters in Brussels. She has some methodological concerns about the paper, including the use of local people \u2014 who might have opposed the occupation \u2014 as interviewers. She also points out that the result does not fit with any she has recorded in 15 years of studying conflict zones. Even in Darfur, where armed groups have wiped out whole villages, she says that researchers have not recorded the 500 predominately violent deaths per day that the Johns Hopkins team estimates are occurring in Iraq. But overall Guha-Sapir says the paper contains the best data yet on the mortality rate in Iraq. And none of the experts contacted by  Nature  said that their doubts fatally undermined the study. Some, such as Daponte, would have liked the authors to have better assessed their method's shortcomings before releasing a result with such political impact. But most say the result is a welcome addition to conflict epidemiology, which is now seen as playing a central role in assessing the severity of wars, and in helping states recover from them (see ' Counting the cost of war '). Burnham says he would now like to study patterns of migration in Iraq and the state of the health system. He would also like to estimate deaths based on a sample 4\u20135 times bigger than that used so far. But survey teams are in danger on the streets of Iraqi towns, and Burnham doubts whether the need for more detailed data justifies the risk. \n                     Scientists become targets in Iraq \n                   \n                     German hostage was saving Iraq digs \n                   \n                     US bungled investigation into weapons research in Iraq \n                   \n                     Iraq Body Count \n                   \n                     United Nations report on Iraq deaths \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Like the presidential elections, they are held every four years (the last presidential election was in 2004 and the next will be in 2008).  \n              What do the results decide? \n            Some members of Congress and state governors. Congress is made up of two branches: the House of Representatives and the Senate. The House has 435 members; each of the 50 states gets a certain number of members, which depends on its population. The Senate has 100 members, two from each state.  Representatives in the House are elected to two-year terms; senators serve six-year terms. So every two years, all 435 seats in the House are up for grabs, as well as one-third of the Senate seats. Governorships are a bit more complicated, as states have different rules for electing their leaders. Thirty-four of the states elect governors to four-year terms during midterm elections; two others elect governors to two-year terms at the same time. So there are 36 governorships to be contested in midterm elections, and 18 in presidential elections.  \n              Why are they important? \n            This is a particularly crucial year because many observers think that the Democratic party may gain majorities in both the House and the Senate for the first time since 1994. President Bush is experiencing some of the lowest approval ratings of his presidency, and other scandals \u2014 including the resignation of a member of Congress after questions were raised about e-mails he had sent to a 16-year-old boy working on Capitol Hill \u2014 have also recently rocked the Republican party.

Tokyo In a departure from tradition, Japan's new prime minister, Shinzo Abe, has appointed a vocal supporter of science, Kiyoshi Kurokawa, as his special adviser. The two men promise to reform dramatically Japan's rigid structures of scientific education, funding and decision-making, in order to boost technology and innovation in the country. But with hard details lacking, some observers are left wondering how much will really change. Abe took over the premier job from Junichiro Koizumi in late September  (see Box 1) . He is expected to continue Koizumi's reforms of science policy, including making universities more competitive and increasing career opportunities for young researchers and women. But in a surprise move, on 3 October Abe appointed Kurokawa, former president of the Science Council of Japan, as the cabinet's special adviser  (see Box 2) . Kurokawa is the first such adviser with a science background \u2014 his four predecessors were economic or legal experts. The motive seems to be a desire to boost the economy without falling back on tax cuts, which are unpopular in Japan. \u201cI think the prime minister is aware that he needs a scientific adviser,\u201d says Kurokawa. \u201cTo keep growing, we need innovation in science and technology that can totally change society, like the Industrial Revolution and the Internet.\u201d Hiroyuki Abe, a member of the Japan Council for Science and Technology Policy and former president of Tohoku University, agrees, adding: \u201cKurokawa is the best choice because he's been calling for innovation and reforms at the top of academia.\u201d Among other things, Kurokawa will help to create Innovation 25, a plan to forecast what society's needs will be in 2025, and suggest what research should be done in medicine, information technology and the environment to meet those needs. The push gives greater impetus to the direction Koizumi wanted to move in while he was in office. A team led by Kurokawa is expected to complete the plan by around June next year. It won't include any detailed policy recommendations, but could pave the way for increasing funding and overhauling the grant system, while reforming education and research systems to make them more flexible. Ikuo Kabashima, professor of political science at the University of Tokyo, says that changes could start coming into effect once Shinzo Abe has ensured the stability of his administration after an upper-house election scheduled for the summer next year. \u201cCalling for innovation as a drive for economic growth sounds better to the public than tax cuts,\u201d he says. But he warns that conservative ministries and universities are likely to put up quite a fight rather than lose their current powers. Researchers will also take some convincing about the reforms. Fujio Masuoka, a professor at Tohoku University and the inventor of flash memory, is sceptical about the likelihood of reform. He has experienced rejections from various ministries over the past few years, when applying for funding to create a three-dimensional semiconductor chip. He gave up three years ago and started working with a company in Dubai instead, which invested \u00a510 billion (US$84 million) in his project. \u201cWhenever we want to try new things, we hit a wall because a consensus of several reviewers is needed and that system makes it hard to evaluate unique research properly,\u201d says Masuoka. \u201cI don't expect anything to change in Japan.\u201d \n                     Japan's university shake-up wins faint praise after first year \n                   \n                     Winds of change blow away the cobwebs on campus \n                   \n                     Japan shakes up council to offer scientists political clout \n                   \n                     The Cabinet Office \n                   \n                     The Science Council of Japan \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Fifty leading scientists in Poland have signed an open letter in protest against an aggressive anti-evolution campaign launched by the League of Polish Families (LPR), the ultra-right-wing coalition partner in the conservative Polish government. \u201cThe theory of evolution is a lie,\u201d Miros\u0142aw Orzechowski, Poland's deputy education minister, told the newspaper  Gazeta Wyborcza  on 14 October. \u201cIt is an error we have legalized as a common truth.\u201d The LPR entered the ruling coalition in May 2006. Its leader, Roman Giertych, is also known to favour creationist views. These, as well as his openly homophobic, anti-Semitic and nationalistic opinions, have sparked student demonstrations in Warsaw since he took the minister of education job in May. Giertych's father, Maciej Giertych, is an LPR member in the European Parliament and is lobbying for obligatory inclusion of creationism in Polish biology curricula. Maciej, who holds a PhD in tree physiology from the University of Toronto, Canada, claims darwinian evolution is refuted by scientific evidence.

The Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI), a non-profit research organization that funds more than 300 US researchers, is considering a plan to pressure its investigators into making their published papers freely accessible. The plan, if approved, would dictate that publications must be deposited in a public database within six months of publication in order to count towards an investigator's application for reappointment. HHMI investigators apply for reappointment every five or seven years. The proposal embodies the latest stage of the open-access movement: enforcement. After years of requesting voluntary compliance, several funding agencies are considering tougher stances. In 2005, the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) asked grantees to voluntarily deposit articles in a public database such as PubMed Central within 12 months of publication. A year after the request, only 4% of NIH grantees had done so, prompting Congress to propose legislation mandating compliance. Meanwhile, on 1 October, Britain's Medical Research Council and the Wellcome Trust medical charity began requiring grantees to deposit final, peer-reviewed manuscripts in public databases as soon as possible, but no later than within six months of publication. Failure to do so, says Wellcome Trust director Mark Walport, would be a breach of granting conditions. HHMI president Thomas Cech says a decision on the proposed policy will probably be made in early 2007. Although HHMI officials say they will not legislate where their investigators publish, several researchers say the threat of weakening their reappointment application represents significant pressure. Cech says the proposed policy is simply an extension of HHMI guidelines about sharing published reagents and other research material. \u201cThe publications are the most useful product of our investigators' research,\u201d says Cech. The HHMI is still negotiating with publishers, but Walport says most major journals, including  Science  and  Nature , have complied with the Wellcome Trust's guidelines. Many publishers let authors pay to make their articles available immediately. For example, Wellcome Trust grantees can make their papers in most Elsevier journals publicly accessible for $3,000 per article. Both the HHMI and the Wellcome Trust already provide funds for publication in open-access journals. \u201cWe see payment to the publisher as part of the cost of research,\u201d says Walport. \u201cAnd we're prepared to pay appropriately.\u201d But some publishers continue to struggle with the Wellcome Trust's requirement. If a paper is available in a public database, this reduces the number of visits to subscription sites, says Martin Frank, executive director of the American Physiological Society. Frank says this is why his society refuses to comply with the Wellcome Trust's guidelines. But such decisions may be more difficult with the proposed expansion of open-access requirements \u2014 Wellcome Trust-funded research accounts for only 2% of the papers in the society's 14 journals, but the NIH supports almost half. Kathleen Case, publisher of the American Association of Cancer Research's five peer-reviewed journals, also considers the requirements too strict. \u201cThe Wellcome Trust asked us to change our policy and we said no,\u201d says Case. \u201cAnd now we've been blacklisted.\u201d \n                     PS I want all the rights \n                   \n                     Congress pushes plan to make papers free \n                   \n                     Open-access journal hits rocky times \n                   \n                     UK research councils claim success for open-access publishing plan \n                   \n                     Societies take united stand on journal access \n                   \n                     Medical research news channel \n                   \n                     Howard Hughes Medical Institute \n                   \n                     Wellcome Trust Open Access policy \n                   \n                     Securing a Hybrid Environment for Research Preservation and Access (SHERPA) \n                   \n                     American Physiological Society \n                   \n                     American Association for Cancer Research \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Boston When Ivan Schwab first learned that he was slated to win an Ig Nobel prize for explaining why woodpeckers don't get headaches, his response was perhaps predictable for a man whose past had come back to haunt him: he denied everything. \u201cI didn't do the work,\u201d Schwab, an ophthalmologist at the University of California, Davis, told the event's organizer after being informed of the dubious honour in store for him. Ig Nobel prizes are given for \u201cachievements that make people laugh, and then make them think\u201d. Schwab gave credit instead to Philip May, a former psychiatry professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, who died in 1986. A deal was soon reached: Schwab agreed to share the 2006 Ornithology prize with May for research initiated by May and associates in 1976 and taken up by Schwab a quarter of a century later. To May, the woodpecker represented a unique \u201cexperiment in Nature\u201d and a chance to understand how an animal could continually use its head as a battering ram without sustaining headaches, concussions or other brain injuries. A pileated woodpecker may strike its beak against a tree 12,000 times a day for the purposes of feeding, nest construction, ritual drumming (to claim territory and attract mates), and even to relieve tension. They peck at rates of up to 20 times a second \u2014 each blow is comparable to striking a wall, face-first, at 25 kilometres an hour. This results in deceleration forces of about 1,200 g , which is hundreds of times more than astronauts endure. Given the ill effects of headbanging seen in humans, May wondered why the countryside was not \u201clittered with dazed and dying woodpeckers\u201d. Clearly, woodpeckers do not get headaches or serious head injuries, May reasoned, or they would stop pecking. So how do they prevent it? After dissecting the heads and beaks of two woodpeckers (which were compared with similar toucan samples) and analysing high-speed photographs of live woodpecker strikes, May and his colleagues advanced several explanations (P. R. May  et al .  Lancet   i  (7957), 454\u2013455; 1976;  Arch. Neurol.   36,  370\u2013373; 1979). The woodpecker brain has relatively little cerebrospinal fluid, reducing the transmission of shock waves, and it is tightly packed in dense, spongy bone that keeps internal movements to a minimum. Muscles encircling the skull serve as shock absorbers, \u201cholding the bill in resilient rigidity\u201d. Like boxers, woodpeckers tense their neck muscles before absorbing a blow. And their drilling trajectory is essentially linear, with little or no rotation of the head, to avoid shearing forces. A third eyelid closes a millisecond before each strike to secure and shield the eye. Schwab, a bird enthusiast since childhood, read May's 1976  Lancet  article and later papers with keen interest. On occasion, he mentioned the woodpecker example in ophthalmology classes and at conferences, citing the potential for retinal damage, and always engaged his audience. Yet he yearned to do more on the subject. He got his chance in 2000, when he became an editor of the  British Journal of Ophthalmology . In 2002, Schwab put a woodpecker on the journal's cover and wrote an essay presenting May's findings and discussing anatomical features that might provide further protection, as a result of dissections and CT scans he had performed of a pileated woodpecker head (I. R. Schwab  Br. J. Ophthalmol.   86,  843; 2002). But Schwab's main objective was to bring attention to May's neglected work. \u201cWe can't all win Nobel prizes,\u201d he says. \u201cBut we can look at the world around us and ask questions, just as May did.\u201d In his own field, Schwab asks, for example, why polar bears don't get ultraviolet keratopathy \u2014 sunburn of the eyes. How can a jellyfish, which lacks a brain, process the visual information it gets from its eyes? Why do scallops have hundreds of eyes and giant clams thousands? Questions such as these, says Schwab, are \u201cthe basis of discovery\u201d. For that reason, Schwab says he is proud to be associated with May's research and was delighted to receive an Ig Nobel on his behalf at the ceremony held at Harvard University on 5 October (see  'The Ig Nobel winners' circle' ). He certainly got into the spirit of things, attending the festivities in a woodpecker headdress. As for his initial reluctance, Schwab explains: \u201cI was embarrassed to receive an Ig Nobel prize for work I did not do.\u201d In that respect, he stands out from previous winners, who were embarrassed to receive Ig Nobels for work they did do. \n                     Ig Nobels hail world's longest-running experiment \n                   \n                     Nobel Laureates show their lighter side \n                   \n                     Harvard ceremony graced by hula-hooping laureates \n                   \n                     Flatulent fish net Ig Nobel award \n                   \n                     Improbable Research \n                   \n                     The Ig Nobel awards \n                   \n                     BJO Editorial: Who is Ivan Schwab? \n                   \n                     Visual Resources for Ornithology \n                   \n                     National Audubon Society \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Despite the small size of the blast, Jim Giles and Geoff Brumfiel get little reassurance from the weapon watchers. It was probably the worst first nuclear test in history, say weapons experts who have carried out preliminary analyses of the seismological data. But the North Koreans will have learned a great deal from the nuclear blast they set off on 9 October. And although experts' estimates of the country's technological expertise aren't much altered, North Korea's intent is now unmistakable. Seismographs around the world registered shock waves from the event, which the North Korean press agency claimed originated from an underground nuclear test (see Map). The event, measured at magnitude 4.2 by the US Geological Survey, was probably too large to be caused by conventional explosives, but too small to be a completely successful nuclear test \u2014 unless, as some experts believe, North Korea was testing a more sophisticated device than previously thought. As  Nature  went to press, there was disagreement over the size of the explosion (see  'The nuclear detectives' ), although most governments and experts agree that the seismograph data suggest a device equivalent to around 500 tonnes of TNT. If that is the case, the test was probably what nuclear experts term a 'fizzle' \u2014 a device that failed to create a full chain reaction in the plutonium and so produced a smaller than planned nuclear explosion. Weapons experts assumed that North Korea had one or two nuclear devices, but the fizzle suggests that their programme might not be as sophisticated as thought. \u201cIt looks like it was the least successful first test ever,\u201d says James Acton, nuclear-weapons expert at London think-tank VERTIC. \u201cThey're an embarrassment to the nuclear club,\u201d adds Jeffrey Lewis, executive director of the Managing the Atom project at Harvard's Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs. North Korea's bomb is thought to have been a relatively simple atomic device, working entirely on nuclear fission, in which the margin for failure can be reduced by adding extra mat-erial and conventional explosives. Lewis says he is unaware of a first test by any other country leading to such a failure. \u201cFrankly I'm baffled,\u201d he says. \u201cThis is supposed to be really easy.\u201d Experts guess that the North Korean device consisted of a series of conventional explosives that were detonated to compress a sphere of plutonium until it reached critical mass, at which point a runaway fission reaction causes a massive release of energy. But even with such a simple device, there can be problems. If more than a few percent of the fissile material consists of plutonium isotopes other than plutonium-239, the chain reaction can begin before the sphere reaches maximum compression. The neutron generator, which triggers the chain reaction, might have been triggered at slightly the wrong time. It's also possible that in an effort to conserve their limited supply of plutonium, the North Koreans put too little in their device. They might also have used too few conventional explosives or these did not work properly, leading to an asymmetrical implosion. \u201cIt's not that difficult, but a lot of things can go wrong,\u201d says William Press, a senior fellow at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) in New Mexico, and a member of the JASONs, a group of scientists that provides advice to the US government on nuclear issues. The much more worrying possibility is that North Korea was testing a more sophisticated weapon. John Pike, director of GlobalSecurity.org, a Washington-based security website, believes it may have been trying to test the first stage, or 'primary', of a hydrogen bomb. In an H-bomb, the fission explosion is designed to trigger a much larger fusion reaction. Lewis discounts the idea: \u201cI don't know of a country that's gone straight to the hydrogen bomb,\u201d he says. Press adds that even a primary must have a yield higher than that detected on 9 October: \u201cBy far the most likely design is an unboosted, spherical-implosion, plutonium bomb,\u201d he says. But Pike points to evidence suggesting that North Korea might actually have carried out its first nuclear test in Pakistan in 1998, when the two states' nuclear programmes were closely entwined. Moving from a first nuclear test to a primary might not be that difficult, he says \u2014 for example, the Israelis started building a hydrogen bomb in the 1980s, after just one nuclear test in 1979. Siegfried Hecker, former director of LANL, visited nuclear scientists in North Korea in 2004 and 2005. He too warns against underestimat-ing them. \u201cI would have to assume they have the know-how to make a bomb,\u201d he says. \u201cWe just don't know exactly what they were trying to do.\u201d Hecker thinks it's unlikely the North Koreans were testing a primary. But he says the size of the explosion suggests that they may have been trying to miniaturize the bomb into something that could be carried on a ballistic missile. \u201cThat ups the difficulty significantly,\u201d he says. Even if the explosion was a partially failed test of a basic device, North Korean researchers will have learnt a great deal from it, says Acton. Comparing the results of the test with previous computer simulations will allow the North Koreans to assess the accuracy of their models. Even if the test reveals a seriously flawed design, Acton says that at an \u201cabsolute upper limit\u201d the country is no more than two years away from developing a functioning weapon. \u201cIf it was a fizzle, then they could easily learn enough from it to be in business for their next test,\u201d agrees Press. According to most estimates, North Korea has enough material for between six and eight nuclear weapons. It may be hoping to mount those weapons on missiles such as the TaePodong-2, although the bomb tested on 9 October was probably far too big. The TaePodong-2 itself failed and fell into the Sea of Japan after just a 42-second flight when tested on 4 July. Ultimately, the failure or otherwise of the North Korean weapon may have little effect on the response of nations such as the United States and China, according to Michael Levi, a physicist at the independent Council of Foreign Relations in New York: \u201cFrom a political standpoint it makes essentially no difference whether it was a fizzle,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat matters is their willingness to test.\u201d \n                 See Editorial,  \n                 \n                     page 605 \n                   \n               \n                     A global folly \n                   \n                     Experts abuzz over North Korean missile failure \n                   \n                     Nuclear treaty 'would improve detection of rogue tests' \n                   \n                     Nuclear proliferation special: We have the technology \n                   \n                     Nuclear proliferation special \n                   \n                     Preparatory nuclear-test-ban organization \n                   \n                     Globalsecurity.org on nuclear testing \n                   \n                     Korea Central News Agency \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

At first glance it seems that this year's Nobel Prize in Chemistry has gone to a biologist. Roger Kornberg at Stanford University, California, won the prize for unravelling the mysteries of transcription \u2014 getting information out of DNA and into proteins via RNA. His major breakthrough was working out the crystal structure of RNA polymerase II \u2014 an enzyme that helps messenger RNA take information from DNA. People working in the field are thrilled at the news. \u201cKornberg's work is a  tour de force  in understanding how transcription works at an atomic level,\u201d says Richard Treisman at Cancer Research UK's transcription laboratory in London. But chemistry bloggers are disgruntled that Kornberg's use of a chemistry tool \u2014 crystallography \u2014 was enough to warrant a chemistry Nobel prize. Unofficial mutterings from chemistry department corridors confirm some surprise at the choice of recipient. \u201cIt is certainly on the biological side of biochemistry,\u201d says Malcolm Green, an inorganic chemist from the University of Oxford, UK. Jesper Svejstrup, a gene-transcription researcher at Cancer Research UK, was a postdoc in Kornberg's laboratory from 1993 to 1996. \u201cIt is unusual to have a single winner,\u201d he says. \u201cI think the reason is that it's a chemistry prize.\u201d Had the prize been for physiology or medicine it would have been shared with Kornberg's co-workers, whose roles were more biological, he suggests. \u201cWhat we need is a biology prize,\u201d jokes Robert Schrock, an inorganic chemist at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who won the prize for chemistry in 2005. Schrock's prize, shared with Yves Chauvin and Robert Grubbs, was for hard-core chemistry \u2014 metathesis, a catalytic reaction used by organic chemists as a way of swapping different groups of atoms in two reacting molecules. This delighted many chemistry fundamentalists, says Schrock, who has heard plenty of grumbles about biology encroaching on chemistry. The 2005 prize came after a run of bio-related chemistry prizes: in 2002 for determining the structure of biological macromolecules; in 2003 for deciphering channels in cell membranes; and in 2004 for the discovery of the role of ubiquitin in intracellular protein degradation. \u201cChemistry is becoming more applied,\u201d Schrock suggests as one reason for the trend. And, after all, \u201cbiology is chemistry\u201d, he insists. Chemistry is evolving naturally, says Schrock. There are fewer developments in basic chemistry than in its biological applications, which means that fundamental contributions to chemistry get less recognition. It's a matter of labels, he says. \u201cChemistry is only going to become more important \u2014 however you want to name it.\u201d The Nobel committee for chemistry 2006 is chaired by a professor of theoretical physical chemistry, H\u00e5kan Wennerstr\u00f6m, from Lund University in Sweden. The rest of the members include: a professor of biophysics, a professor of organic chemistry, a professor of molecular biophysics, a professor of physiological chemistry, and a professor of biochemistry. \u201cNo surprise that the prize goes to biostuff,\u201d laments one blogger. But Aaron Klug, who has worked with Kornberg and who won the chemistry prize in 1982 for developing crystallographic electron microscopy and working out the structure of nucleic acid\u2013protein complexes, is happy with the choice. \u201cKornberg certainly thinks like a chemist,\u201d he says. \u201cThe whole way he handled the RNA polymerase material is beautiful chemistry.\u201d Klug goes as far as to suggest that this year's physiology and medicine prize, awarded to Andrew Fire and Craig Mello for discovering RNA interference, could also have been a chemistry prize. \u201cThe question is whether large molecules are part of chemistry.

Scientific and human-rights organizations have rallied to the cause of six medical workers imprisoned in Libya, accused of deliberately infecting hundreds of children with HIV. The workers look likely to be found guilty and could face the death penalty, yet independent scientists who have reviewed the evidence are convinced they are innocent. Emmanuel Altit, a lawyer with Avocats sans Fronti\u00e8res based in Toulouse, France, which is handling the defence of the health workers, welcomes the renewed pressure as \u201cformidable, exactly the sort of thing that's needed now\u201d But he adds that pressure needs to be increased and sustained throughout the rest of the trial. (See  box ) The five Bulgarian nurses and one Palestinian doctor, who have been in prison since 1999, were sentenced to death in 2004. The verdict was overturned in 2005 by the Libyan Supreme Court, which ordered a retrial that began in May this year. A verdict is expected next month, and the defence team isn't hopeful. Although many human-rights groups have supported the six in the past, the Supreme Court ruling led to a false sense of security and international pressure to free the medics dropped, says Zafra Lerman, chair of the subcommittee on scientific freedom and human rights of the American Chemical Society (ACS). The call by a Libyan prosecutor at the end of August for the death penalty came as a shock. \u201cWe relaxed too much; we thought the retrial would just see them being released. We didn't see this new danger coming,\u201d says Lerman, who has won awards for her work in helping to free Soviet dissidents and Chinese scientists jailed after the 1989 Tianan-men Square protests. So last week, the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the ACS, Physicians for Human Rights, and Amnesty International issued new human-rights action alerts for the medical workers. In particular, they reiterated last month's call by the defence lawyers for the court to hear independent scientific evidence (see  Nature  443 , 245\u2013246; 2006 ). But despite a Palestinian being one of the accused, science bodies in the Arab world have been relatively silent on the case. \u201cThe case is not on the radar at all,\u201d says Moneef Al-Zou'bi, director-general of the Islamic Academy of Sciences, based in Amman, Jordan. \u201cIt has not attracted as much attention in this part of the world compared to elsewhere.\u201d The academy, created by the Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC), which represents 57 Islamic countries, has not taken a position on the case. \u201cPeople here have so many political and economic problems, including the conflicts in Iraq and Palestine, that the case has just not become a priority,\u201d says Al-Zou'bi. Such difficulties mean that the academy's human-rights focus is much more on promoting basic socio-economic rights, he adds, such as access to clean water. Not everyone agrees with that position. \u201cThis is a difficult call,\u201d says one official at an international human-rights body, who asked not to be named. \u201cOf course it is totally legitimate to prioritize the most basic rights for the largest number of people. But there is definitely a pattern of organizations in this region virtually ignoring violations of civil and political rights in their own neighbourhoods. I would think that at the very least, scientific or medical organizations would come out in support of colleagues sentenced to death in such a blatant case of scape-goating and dismissal of science. And in the end, when this can happen to health workers, the right to health also comes under threat.\u201d The OIC's Commission on Scientific and Technological Cooperation (COMSTECH) hasn't taken a position either. Chairman Atta-ur-Rahman, who is also Pakistan's higher education minister, says that human-rights issues are beyond the commission's remit. \u201cCOM-STECH's charter is confined purely to matters concerning scientific and technological cooperation between member states\u201d, and so does not extend to legal and judicial matters, he explains. Imad Khatib, secretary-general of the Palestine Academy for Science and Technology in East Jerusalem, says his academy \u201ccares deeply about the plight of the nurses and the doctor and that they have a fair trial\u201d, although he says that most of its human-rights efforts are spent on the abuse of scientists' rights within Palestine.

After a federal court ruled that intelligent design could not be taught in schools in Dover, Pennsylvania, many thought the idea would fade from public view (see  Nature  439  6\u20137; 2006 ). But intelligent design is re-emerging as a political issue. \u201cIt continues to have legs, and we're going to have to worry about it,\u201d says Lawrence Krauss, a theoretical physicist at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio, and chair of the advisory board of Help Ohio Public Education (HOPE), a group that opposes the teaching of intelligent design in the state. In 2004, the Ohio school board approved language encouraging a \u201ccritical analysis\u201d of evolution and a lesson plan that included arguments used by supporters of intelligent design. The plan was repealed shortly after the Dover decision in February, but advocates of intelligent design are again running for positions on the board. In response, HOPE is endorsing its own candidates. In Michigan, the Republican candidate for state governor, Dick DeVos, has expressed support for teaching intelligent design. He is neck-and-neck with the Democratic governor Jennifer Granholm, and the statement may be an effort to energize conservatives, says Robert Pennock, president of the pro-evolution Michigan Citizens for Science. \u201cThis issue is seen by fundamentalists and evangelicals as part of the culture wars,\u201d Pennock says.

The discovery that finally turned cosmology into a hard science has scooped this year's Nobel Prize in Physics. John Mather and George Smoot's measurements of the earliest moments of the Universe, made with the COBE (Cosmic Background Explorer) satellite, created a whole field of research and captured the imagination of millions around the world. \u201cWe used to have derision cosmology,\u201d says Max Tegmark, a cosmologist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. \u201cPeople used to make fun of this field as being very flaky and philosophical. Now we have precision cosmology.\u201d COBE's goal was to study the heat left from the Big Bang. The existence of this afterglow, know as the cosmic microwave background, was predicted in the 1940s and confirmed by measurements made in the 1960s. The Nobel prize is awarded for two discoveries. The first, from a team led by Mather, now at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, is the measurement of the microwave background's spectrum, which confirmed that it had the shape of 'black-body' radiation. Such radiation is emitted by an object of a particular temperature \u2014 in this case, by the Universe when its temperature was thousands of degrees hotter than today. This result was the first indication that cosmologists would be able to use properties of the radiation to test theories about the origin of the Universe. Mather showcased the findings at a conference in January 1990 and was greeted with a standing ovation. \u201cIn my whole career, it's the only one I've witnessed,\u201d says Carlos Frenk, a cosmologist at the University of Durham, UK, who has worked with COBE data. Smoot, now at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California, was in charge of seeking slight fluctuations in the temperature of the microwave background. These are the imprint of the Universe's early structure \u2014 the clumps of matter that formed the seeds of today's galaxies and stars. Detecting this anisotropy was a feat that some thought beyond the sensitivity of COBE. \u201cA lot of people thought they weren't going to find anything,\u201d says Tegmark. But in 1992 Smoot announced to worldwide acclaim that he had found the ripples. This was the strongest evidence so far that the Big Bang happened. \u201cAnisotropy is like looking at the fossil record and having that exposed for the first time,\u201d says Anthony Lasenby of the University of Cambridge, UK. At the time, Lasenby was very close to finding similar results of his own. \u201cWe were working on an experiment in Tenerife,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was showing the first signs of fluctuations but we needed more time.\u201d Smoot got there first. But it was important to verify and correlate Smoot's results, says Lasenby, without a hint of bitterness. After COBE came WMAP (the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe), named after David Wilkinson, who was instrumental in setting up the COBE mission and who died in 2002. Many believe he would have shared today's prize had he survived. WMAP surveyed the background radiation in even greater detail, and will be followed in 2008 by the European Space Agency's Planck satellite. But the impact of COBE is so far unmatched. Physicist Stephen Hawking caught the mood in 1992 when he described Smoot's results as \u201cthe greatest discovery of the century \u2014 if not of all time\u201d.

Two recently published books are riling the small but influential community of string theorists, by arguing that the field is wandering dangerously far from the mainstream. The books' titles say it all:  Not Even Wrong , a phrase that physicist Wolfgang Pauli used to describe incomplete ideas, and  The Trouble with Physics: The Rise of String Theory, the Fall of a Science, and What Comes Next . Both articulate a fear that the field is becoming too abstract and is focusing on aesthetics rather than reality. Some physicists even warn that the theory's dominance could pose a threat to the scientific method itself (see  page 507 ). Those accusations are vehemently denied by string theorists, and the books \u2014 written by outsiders \u2014 have stirred deep resentment in the tight-knit community.  Not Even Wrong  was published in June and  The Trouble with Physics  came out in September; shortly after they appeared on the Amazon books website, string theorist Lubo\u0161 Motl of Harvard University posted reviews furiously entitled \u201cBitter emotions and obsolete understanding of high-energy physics\u201d and \u201cAnother postmodern diatribe against modern physics and scientific method\u201d. As  Nature  went to press, the reviews had been removed. Few in the community are, at least publicly, as vitriolic as Motl. But many are angry and struggling to deal with the criticism. \u201cMost of my friends are quietly upset,\u201d says Leonard Susskind, a string theorist at Stanford University in California. String theory postulates that the Universe consists of tiny strings vibrating in ten or so dimensions. Its fortunes have been buoyed by popular books in the past \u2014 most notably Brian Greene's 1999 bestseller  The Elegant Universe , which said that the approach might unify the incompatible theories of gravity and quantum mechanics. \n               Strung up \n             But the theory has its share of problems, and these are the focus of the new works. For one thing, recent calculations suggest that it generates 10 500  possible models of the Universe (see  Nature   439 , 10\u201312; 2006). This renders the theory essentially meaningless, according to critics. When these countless possibilities were first announced, Lee Smolin was already working on the book that eventually became  The Trouble With Physics . A physicist at the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics in Waterloo, Canada, Smolin had previously worked on string theory. \u201cI and many other people began to get worried,\u201d he says. Another difficulty is that if strings exist, they would be detectable only at energies far above anything that today's experiments can measure. \u201cAs you're not constrained by having to reproduce experiments, you can go off and play with whatever you want,\u201d says Peter Woit, a mathematician at Columbia University in New York City, and author of  Not Even Wrong . \u201cThe danger is that you'll end up with the theoretical community becoming completely isolated from the rest of physics.\u201d Smolin, whose book promotes an alternative theory known as loop quantum gravity, adds that string theorists have intentionally cut themselves off. \u201cNone of the major string theory groups has hired a postdoc or faculty member working in any of the other approaches to quantum gravity,\u201d he says. \u201cBut other research groups in quantum gravity have often hired young people working in string theory out of a sense that it should be encouraged.\u201d \n               Boundary issues \n             String theorists dispute the claim that they are isolating themselves. In recent years the theory has contributed significantly to heavy-ion physics, according to Joe Polchinski, a string theorist at the Kavli Institute for Theoretical Physics in Santa Barbara, California. When the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider at Brookhaven National Laboratory in Upton, New York, first produced a hot quark gas, it was string theory that correctly predicted, retrospectively, some of the gas's properties. \u201cIn many ways, I feel the boundaries with other areas of physics are coming down,\u201d Polchinski says. Warren Perkins, a cosmologist and particle theorist at Swansea University in Wales, agrees. In recent years, he says, string theory has been proven equivalent to a conventional 'field theory', of the type being used to predict how particles will behave at the soon-to-open Large Hadron Collider, sited near Geneva. \u201cThere has been a lot of cross-talk between field theory and string theory,\u201d says Perkins. In some cases, string theory has provided far simpler approximations than its field-theory counterpart. But strings have yet to provide the elusive link between gravity and quantum mechanics, hoped for by so many theorists. \u201cThe claims, when it comes to theoretical physics, tend to be exaggerated,\u201d says Abhay Ashtekar, who works on quantum gravity at Pennsylvania State University in University Park. He believes the inability of the community to live up to those expectations has made it defensive. The books leave string theorists such as Susskind wondering how to approach such strong public criticism. \u201cI don't know if the right thing is to worry about the public image or keep quiet,\u201d he says. He fears the argument may \u201cfuel the discrediting of scientific expertise\u201d. That's something that Smolin and Woit insist they don't want. Woit says his problem isn't with the theory itself, just some of its more grandiose claims. \u201cThere are some real things you can do with string theory,\u201d he says. Smolin agrees, and says he hopes theorists will read his book to get a better understanding of his specific issues. \u201cIf they don't want to buy it, tell them to get in touch with me and I'll send them a copy.\u201d \n                     Power and particles \n                   \n                     Unburdened by proof \n                   \n                     Our Universe: Outrageous fortune \n                   \n                     Unravelling string theory \n                   \n                     2005: Year of physics special \n                   \n                     Physical sciences news channel \n                   \n                     Peter Woit's blog \n                   \n                     Lubo\u0161 Motl's blog \n                   \n                     Lee Smolin's webpage \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

The call from Stockholm was received by two unusually young scientists, an impressively short time after they demonstrated a fundamental control of gene expression.  The 2006 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine has gone to Andrew Fire, now at Stanford University, California, and Craig Mello, now at the University of Massachusetts Medical Center in Worcester. Both are in their forties. It honours a discovery that has transformed biological research and may, in the future, prove useful in treating human disease. The discovery is called RNA interference, or RNAi. When a gene is to be expressed, it sends instructions to the cell's protein synthesis machinery. The intermediary is messenger RNA (mRNA), which has a structure complementary to that of the gene. In their breakthrough paper, published in  Nature  in 1998, Fire and Mello, and colleagues, demonstrated that these mRNAs can be targeted for destruction by specific double-stranded forms of RNA (A. Fire  et al .  Nature   391 , 806\u2013811; 1998 ). Researchers already knew that 'antisense' RNA \u2014 an artificial molecule whose sequence complements the mRNA \u2014 could silence specific genes when taken up by a cell. But the effect was modest and inconsistent. And, confusingly, the same effect was seen with 'sense' RNA. In a series of simple and elegant experiments on a muscle gene in the nematode worm  Caenorhabditis elegans , Fire and Mello showed that a powerful and consistent effect required the sense and antisense RNAs to be stuck together, as double-stranded RNA. When injected with the double-stranded RNA, the worms twitched awkwardly, just like mutant worms lacking the muscle gene. The researchers also showed that mRNA was destroyed by the treatment, rather than being masked as others had believed. And they showed that the double-stranded RNA can cause more copies of itself to be made, can spread between cells and can even be inherited by progeny. In the  Nature  paper the researchers speculated that organisms might use this mechanism to control expression of their genes \u2014 a fact soon shown to be true. RNAi turned out to be an important way of controlling 'jumping genes', which can insert themselves throughout the genome and disrupt gene function. It is also thought to help protect against viral infections, at least in simple organisms. Fire and Mello's subsequent research, and that of the many researchers who flooded the field after them, have since filled in the details. The RNAi pathway has been fully worked out and shown to apply to all genes \u2014 not just in worms but in nearly all other species. \u201cThere is hardly a lab not using the tools of RNAi to turn off the genes that they are studying,\u201d says Tom Tuschl of Rockerfeller University, New York, who joined the RNAi \u00e9lite soon after the Fire and Mello discovery. RNAi reagents have been used to find genes involved in everything from ageing to cancer. Clinical hopes are pinned on finding ways to use RNAi to reduce the activity of genes that cause disease. Most Nobel prizes are given many years after the relevant discovery. The Fire and Mello award, given just eight years after publication of their paper, is reminiscent of Kary Mullis's 1993 chemistry Nobel. That prize was awarded for his 1985 invention of the polymerase chain reaction \u2014 a method of gene amplification that invaded research labs just as fast and comprehensively as the RNAi technique has. Ronald Plasterk of the University of Utrecht in the Netherlands, who worked with Fire when they were young researchers at the Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge, UK, says he felt that a Nobel was around the corner. But he didn't think it would be so soon. For a laugh, on the morning of the announcement Plasterk asked his postdoc to call Fire in a pronounced Swedish accent. \u201cBut then we heard he had really won, so the joke had to be dropped.\u201d Mello seemed stunned when interviewed on the Nobel webcast, not long after he had heard the news. \u201cI seem too young,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd isn't the gap unusually short?\u201d \n                     RNA therapy tackles eye disease \n                   \n                     RNA treatment kills mice \n                   \n                     Pioneering HIV treatment would use interference and gene therapy \n                   \n                     Hopes rise for RNA therapy as mouse study hits target \n                   \n                     RNAi Therapy collection \n                   \n                     RNAi in focus \n                   \n                     RNAi insight \n                   \n                     RNA Interference web focus \n                   \n                     Nobel Foundation \n                   \n                     Craig Mello, Howard Hughes Medical Institute \n                   \n                     Andrew Fire, Stanford University School Of Medicine \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Is carbon dioxide a pollutant? And, if so, should a reluctant Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) be forced into regulating the gas? These questions will be put before the Supreme Court's nine justices this winter, as they consider the case of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts  et al . v. EPA. The case is important for a number of reasons. It is the first of the many lawsuits on climate change to reach the country's highest court. If the EPA loses, it would be forced to contemplate regulations to cap the amount of greenhouse gases emitted by cars. And, most importantly, it may encourage Congress to pass laws regulating carbon dioxide and other gases, lest the courts do its work for it. It is also a sign of the frustration felt by many US states with the Bush administration's inaction on climate change. States and even cities across the country have entered into their own regional climate agreements and tried to regulate greenhouse gases. California has even signed agreements with the United Kingdom, and on 27 September passed a bill that will return the state's emission levels to those of 1990 by 2020. The case is being brought by the state of Massachusetts, along with climate warrior California, ten other states, American Samoa and a long list of cities and environmental groups. It stems from a 1999 formal request to the agency that it regulate greenhouse-gas emissions by cars and trucks under the landmark Clean Air Act. The issue has been working its way through the EPA's regulatory system and the courts ever since. The case is not yet on the Supreme Court's schedule, but James Milkey, the counsel of record for Massachusetts  et al ., says it is likely to be heard in \u201cthe last week in November or the first week of December\u201d. Milkey's side filed its arguments on 31 August; the EPA has applied for an extension to its 5 October filing deadline. But the agency will probably use arguments similar to those it filed when it tried to dissuade the Supreme Court from taking the case (see ' Legal arguments '). Following a day-long hearing, the court will issue an opinion by the end of its term, in late June or early July next year. Among its arguments, the EPA will probably say that the science on global warming is too uncertain to be the basis of expensive regulations. This threadbare argument has elicited two 'amicus curiae' briefs \u2014 documents filed with the court by someone not party to the case. One was from a group of scientists and one from four former EPA administrators. Both say there is a strong scientific consensus, and point out that nothing in science is ever completely certain. The scientists' brief was filed by 18 researchers, including James Hansen, head of the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York, and Nobel prizewinner Sherwood Rowland of the University of California, Irvine. They accuse the EPA of misrepresenting their findings, adding: \u201cThe evidence of these changes...has crystallized a remarkable consensus within the scientific community: climate warming is happening, and human activities are very likely a significant causal factor.\u201d Another EPA argument, that greenhouse gases are not pollutants, has met with derision from environmentalists. \u201cCarbon dioxide is clearly a pollutant \u2014 it is the dose that makes the poison,\u201d says Andrew Aulisi of the World Resources Institute, an environmental think-tank in Washington DC. \u201cThese are political appointees at the top of the agency taking their cues from the White House.\u201d The Supreme Court took the case, experts believe, because of the larger questions it raises over whether a US agency can decide not to do what it is called upon to do by law because of external considerations. In this case, the EPA has argued that regulating greenhouse gases would interfere with the Bush administration's foreign policy: it would remove the bargaining chip of reducing emissions in exchange for reductions by developing countries. Madeleine Albright, former secretary of state, criticizes this argument. She has filed an amicus brief saying that the president's foreign policy should not influence agencies directed by Congress. Power thus leaks from Congress to the president \u2014 a trend that political observers have kept a wary eye on under George Bush. Albright adds that, in any case, negotiation over emissions reductions has not been the Bush administration's strategy. \u201cThe United States is not actually negotiating with developing countries,\u201d says Jody Freeman, who directs the environmental law programme at Harvard Law School in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and drafted the Albright brief. \u201cIt is pursuing a volunteerism strategy.\u201d \u201cYou strip away the global warming and the question is really 'can they do that?'\u201d she says. For this reason, many believe Massachusetts could be favoured by the current judges, despite their conservative leanings. \u201cEven justices who may not be particularly sensitive to the need to regulate global warming may think that an agency is overreaching,\u201d says Freeman. If Massachusetts wins, the EPA will not immediately regulate car emissions. Agency scientists would merely have to determine formally whether greenhouse gases are likely to endanger public health. If they decide this is the case, the agency may begin hammering out regulations. But all this would take years to unfold. More to the point, the case may push Congress to pass some climate-change laws. \u201cPart of all this litigation that's going on in various places is to try to force the issue onto the congressional agenda,\u201d says Deborah Sivas, director of the Environmental Law Clinic at Stanford University in California, and drafter of the brief by the four former EPA administrators (see ' Action on greenhouse gases '). While it waits for the court case to play out, the EPA has remained mute on California's request that it be allowed to regulate greenhouse-gas emissions from cars at state level \u2014 cutting them 30% by 2016. Thanks to a historical quirk in the Clean Air Act, California is the only state allowed to set different standards from those set by the federal government \u2014 with the agency's permission. But once California changes its standards, any state can follow. A letter released on 26 September, signed by more than 100 members of Congress, called on EPA administrator Stephen Johnson to stop stalling. \u201cThere is no basis for EPA to treat this request differently\u201d from the many other requests it has granted, the letter said. Almost a quarter of the members of Congress signed that letter. So perhaps the rumour in green circles that a bill addressing climate change could pass in the next session of Congress is well founded. Much depends on the November elections, in which all congressmen and a third of senators will fight their seats. If the Democrats gain a majority in the House of Representatives \u2014 a possibility at least \u2014 they would control the committee where climate-change bills will come up, and things may really start to move. \n                     Going to court over climate change \n                   \n                     States versus gases \n                   \n                     Greenhouse 'polluters' taken to court \n                   \n                     Regional climate change special \n                   \n                     Climate change in focus \n                   \n                     The case on the Supreme Court Docket \n                   \n                     Natural Resources Defense Council press release, with links to court documents \n                   \n                     California press release on nuisance complaint \n                   \n                     Letter from Congressmen to the EPA \n                   \n                     The Clean Air Act \n                   \n                     Massachusetts Attorney General's page on the case \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

The current incarnation of Wikipedia is both phenomenally successful and, in the eyes of some critics, fundamentally flawed. The online encyclopaedia now includes more than a million entries in English alone. Although anyone can edit any article, its accuracy, at least on science topics, is surprisingly high. But Wikipedia has never given experts special standing when it comes to determining content. And that, critics say, deters the people who ought to be contributing from doing so. Just how big a drawback that is will now be tested, with the launch of an online encyclopaedia that will give privileged status to scientists and other experts. Citizendium, a pilot version of which is due to go live in the next week, will use all of Wikipedia's content but will host it at another website ( http://citizendium.org ) and edit it differently. Editors with appropriate academic qualifications will have the power to settle disputes about wording, for example, and stamp articles they perceive to be accurate as 'approved'. \u201cOne reason we are setting this up is to give scientists and other scholars a new organizational framework to clean up and improve on the work started by Wikipedia,\u201d says Larry Sanger, a philosopher and co-founder of Wikipedia, who is the driving force behind Citizendium. \u201cWikipedia is now the first stop for many people in their search for information on scientific topics. Many scientists would like to help make sure this resource remains accurate, but they have no desire to navigate the treacherous waters of Wikipedia's editorial system, which accords them no official role.\u201d Reactions from the many bloggers who track the progress of Wikipedia have been mixed. Some say Sanger will struggle to define what constitutes expertise, and that arguments about content will be replaced by arguments over who is or isn't an expert. Others think Citizendium will find it hard to attract regular contributors, as the prospect of having an edit overruled by a higher power will not appeal. But scientists who contribute regularly to Wikipedia say Citizendium has promise. \u201cI like the idea notionally,\u201d says Vaughan Bell of the Institute of Psychiatry in London, who contributes to Wikipedia's schizophrenia page, among others. William Connolley of the British Antarctic Survey in Cambridge, UK, who updates Wikipedia climate entries, adds that some scientists have become frustrated with Wikipedia because of the difficulty in agreeing edits, although both he and Bell agree that conflict can sometimes result in better articles. \n                     Experts plan to reclaim the web for pop science \n                   \n                     Internet encyclopaedias go head to head \n                   \n                     Wiki's wild world \n                   \n                     Reference revolution \n                   \n                     Citizendium \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Surely it's easier to clone mammals from cells that are dividing, than from those fated never to do so again? That's certainly the assumption with which most biologists have been working. But results from a study in mice suggest that the opposite may be true: in attempts to clone mouse embryos from three groups of blood cells, the most differentiated ones worked best. The finding could improve the lamentable state of cloning, although experts are stumped for an explanation. In cloning, researchers insert the nucleus of a cell, say a skin cell, into an egg stripped of its own nucleus. This process is thought to reprogramme the DNA in the nucleus, giving it the potential to orchestrate the development of an embryo. Nuclei from stem cells, which can give rise to various other types of cells, were assumed to be easier to reprogramme than nuclei from differentiated cells that have lost the ability to divide. Cloning from embryonic stem cells is much more successful than from adult stem cells, for example. Now Jerry Yang of the University of Connecticut, Storrs, and his colleagues have compared mouse blood cells at three stages of differentiation. One group comprised stem cells that could produce all blood-cell types. A second group of cells could make only a handful of cell types, and a third group was composed of completely differentiated white blood cells called granulocytes. The granulocytes were easiest to clone. With these cells, 35% of cloning attempts yielded young embryos, compared with 11% in the intermediate group and less than 8% from the stem cells ( L.-Y. Sung  et al .  Nature Genet.  doi:10.1038/ng1895; 2006) . Scientists have long debated whether cloning is so difficult because reprogramming doesn't work well, or because the few clones produced grew from rare stem cells lurking among the differentiated cells used. Dolly the sheep, hailed as the first mammal cloned from an adult cell, was created from a mammary gland \u2014 but some claim she could have come from a stem cell in that tissue. Previous attempts to clone from fully differentiated cells have been problematic, and it's possible that granulocytes may simply contain particular biochemical factors that make them easy to clone. But if Yang's result holds generally, Dolly may have come from a differentiated cell after all. It would also be good news for the technique of therapeutic cloning, in which researchers hope to clone patients' cells and use the resulting embryos to extract embryonic stem cells to treat disease. \n                     Simple recipe gives adult cells embryonic powers \n                   \n                     Stem cell superpowers exposed \n                   \n                     Therapeutic cloning gives silenced genes a second voice \n                   \n                     Frog eggs rejuvenate human cells \n                   \n                     Stem cells in focus \n                   \n                     Making stem cells web focus \n                   \n                     Stem cells insight \n                   \n                     Stem cells insight blog \n                   \n                     Stem cells podcast \n                   \n                     25 years of embryonic stem cells \n                   \n                     International Society for Stem Cell Research \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

HIV is a frustrating foe, but at least doctors have been able to count on a few solid principles to help them fight the virus. Now, a group of scientists calling itself 'The Bad Boys of Cleveland' reports evidence that rebels against one of those principles. The findings cement a feeling that has been growing in the HIV research community: that the virus enlists patients' own defences to dismantle their immune systems. This revises the picture first painted a decade ago, when studies reported that levels of HIV in a patient's blood predict how fast the patient will lose vital T cells. Since then, doctors have believed that the virus is the main trigger for T-cell loss. They rely on measurements of viral load to help them decide when and how to treat patients with HIV. But it is increasingly clear that virus levels are only a small part of the story. In fact, as Benigno Rodriguez of Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland reports this week, viral load explains only 4\u20136% of the rate at which a patient's T cells disappear (B. Rodriguez  et al .  J. Am. Med. Assoc.   296,  1498\u20131506; 2006). Rodriguez and his collaborators in California, Massachusetts and Washington examined blood samples from thousands of patients dating from 1984. They analysed the patients' viral load and T-cell count before treatment with antiretroviral drugs. The group found that, in general, patients with higher viral loads lost their T cells faster than those with lower virus levels. But the disease progressed at different rates in patients with similar viral loads. This suggests that something other than virus levels alone is driving T-cell loss. Now, scientists must find out what that is. Many suspect that a phenomenon called immune activation is an important factor. This is the idea that HIV whips the body's immune system into a frenzy, and that this flurry of activity eventually triggers T-cell death. \u201cThis paper will help shift the focus of basic research to immune activation,\u201d says immunologist Zvi Grossman of the US National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland. The paper is also a score for the Bad Boys \u2014 a group of immunologists who have been meeting informally over the past two years. They include about 30 scientists, including Grossman, of whom a handful are 'Bad Girls'. The Bad Boys were first convened by Michael Lederman, head of the Case Western Reserve University Center for AIDS Research and senior author of the recent paper. \u201cThe idea was to have a relaxed but intense forum where we could present our unpublished data, share ideas, then go back to our lives and work some more,\u201d Lederman says. \u201cWe've been doing this on a shoestring \u2014 people pay their own air fare. They come because they like the atmosphere in which we work.\u201d Many see that informal approach as a more refreshing form of collaboration than the large, top-down structures fashionable in HIV research these days (see  Nature   442 , 610\u2013611; 2006). But in their fight against orthodoxy, the Bad Boys have made one concession to scientific propriety. The  Journal of the American Medical Association  paper is the first to reference the Bad Boys, but it acknowledges the group by a much blander name: the Cleveland Immunopathogenesis Consortium. Lederman admits that the wordy title \u201clacks panache\u201d compared with the Bad Boys nickname. But, he says: \u201cWe were anxious that editors might give us grief.\u201d \n                     After Toronto \n                   \n                     Light shed on battle against HIV \n                   \n                     AIDS vaccine research becomes 'big science' \n                   \n                     Ambitious AIDS grants deepen rift between researchers \n                   \n                     AIDS Conference Blog 2006 \n                   \n                     AIDS Special 2004 \n                   \n                     US federal government AIDS info \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

A statement on the science behind the politically sensitive issue of hurricane activity and climate change has been blocked by officials at the US Department of Commerce,  Nature  has learned. Work on the statement began this February after complaints about the actions of political appointees at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), an agency that falls under commerce-department control. NOAA researchers accused the appointees of ignoring \u2014 on the agency's website and at press conferences \u2014 the possibility that global warming could cause hurricanes to become more intense or frequent. The agency was also accused of preventing scientists who believe there might be such a link from speaking out (see  Nature   439 , 896\u2013897; 2006 10.1038/439896a ). The link is a sensitive issue because of the devastation caused by Hurricane Katrina and the US government's reluctance to restrict the greenhouse-gas emissions that are driving climate change. NOAA officials denied both of the accusations from researchers. But e-mails obtained under freedom-of-information legislation by the environmental group Greenpeace USA, based in Washington DC, show that several NOAA scientists told their seniors that the agency was not properly representing hurricane science. The scientists' complaints prompted the creation of an internal seven-member panel charged with preparing a consensus statement on the views of NOAA researchers on hurricane science. A draft seen by  Nature  states that global warming may be contributing to hurricane intensity and that further research is needed to clarify the issue. The document was finalized by the panel in mid-May and was due to be released to the public and the media in time for the start of this year's hurricane season in June. But panel chair Ants Leetmaa, director of NOAA's Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory at Princeton University, New Jersey, received an e-mail on 18 May from a commerce-department official informing him that the document needed to be made less technical and was not to be released. Leetmaa says department officials have not responded to his efforts to contact them since. \n               Getting exercised \n             When asked about the document, NOAA administrator Conrad Lautenbacher told  Nature  that it was simply an internal exercise designed to get researchers to respect each other's points of view. He said it could not be released because the agency cannot take an official position on a field of science that is changing so rapidly. But panel members contacted by  Nature , including Leetmaa, disagree strongly with this interpretation. Internal NOAA and commerce-department e-mails also discuss the timetable for the document being \u201ccleared\u201d for \u201cdistribution\u201d. The draft states that it refers to the \u201ccurrent state of the science\u201d and does not contain \u201cany statements of policy or positions of NOAA\u201d. NOAA's stance on hurricane science came in for further criticism last week. Details have emerged of what critics interpret as government attempts to control media access to Tom Knutson, a NOAA researcher who has published papers suggesting that global warming may make Atlantic hurricanes more intense. E-mails obtained by the online news magazine  Salon  show that Chuck Fuqua, a press officer at the Department of Commerce, enquired about Knutson's views on global warming when considering an interview request from CNBC television. He then asked whether other NOAA researchers who dispute the warming link might be interviewed instead. One such researcher, Chris Landsea, is described in another e-mail as the \u201cbest source\u201d to explain why climate change is not increasing hurricane activity. Lautenbacher says the agency would not \u201ccondone anything that works in that way\u201d and that he has taken steps to ensure that researchers are not prevented from talking to the press. Despite the blocked consensus report, it does now seem easier for scientists to speak to the media. A year or so ago, NOAA researchers complained of having to run interview requests by press officers, but scientists at the agency told  Nature  they are no longer required to do so. The documents obtained by Greenpeace do, however, indicate that NOAA press releases must still be seen by commerce-department officials as part of a 13-step approval process (pictured above). A department spokesperson says they need to see the releases so that they can prepare for enquiries, adding that officials would never change the scientific content of a release for non-scientific reasons. Another of the complaints made earlier this year by NOAA researchers has also prompted an agency response, albeit a minor one. According to the Greenpeace e-mails, Knutson and colleagues complained about an article on NOAA's website, which claimed that the recent increase in Atlantic hurricane activity \u201cis not related to greenhouse warming\u201d. The article, published last November, stated that there was a \u201cconsensus\u201d in the NOAA that the intense 2005 hurricane season was due to natural variability. It was criticized by climate researchers, some of whom believe that global warming may have played a role in recent hurricane activity. The article itself remains unchanged, but the complaint did prompt the addition of a note at the end, stating that it does not represent the views of all NOAA researchers. \n                     Atlantic hurricane season forecast high \n                   \n                     Tempers flare at hurricane meeting \n                   \n                     Storms get fewer but fiercer \n                   \n                     Trouble brews over contested trend in hurricanes \n                   \n                     July winds predict hurricane damage \n                   \n                     Climate change in focus \n                   \n                     Regional climate change special \n                   \n                     National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration \n                   \n                     Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

That knowledge would enable one to predict the characteristic structure of any given protein from its gene sequence \u2014 a critical tool for understanding how proteins interact and for developing effective drugs. But Japan's ambitious Protein 3000 project will end its five-year term next March amid criticism that, despite looking set to meet its goal of solving 3,000 structures, the information gained is of limited use, and its high-throughput approach might even be depriving the field of valuable research skills. Recent science-ministry budget requests show that protein research in Japan will change dramatically, focusing on new analysis methods and on proteins related to specific diseases. The shift means an uncertain fate for the huge nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) facility that has been the backbone of the project. Protein structures are mainly determined by two methods \u2014 NMR and X-ray crystallography. NMR detects the magnetic properties of the atoms in proteins in solution to identify how they are arranged. X-ray crystallography requires that proteins first be crystallized. But many biologically important proteins are too big for NMR and impossible to crystallize. Instead, the five-year project aimed to develop a 'reference library' of representative protein folds. Scientists could then translate information about the amino-acid building-blocks into predictions about overall structure, even of larger molecules. The project has received roughly \u00a58 billion (US$70 million) per year since April 2002. Half of that money went to the RIKEN research institute to solve 2,500 structures using its NMR facility in Yokohama and its X-ray beamlines at the SPring-8 synchrotron radiation facility in Harima. The other half went to labs targeting specific proteins. The project has, in quantitative terms, sailed along. Japan has an impressive 40 NMR machines, and Shigeyuki Yokoyama, who heads the NMR facility and is overall director of the project, says that by March this year the two RIKEN facilities had produced nearly 1,600 structures, with the project as a whole set to meet its goal of 3,000 by next March. \u201cIn this sense it is a great success,\u201d says Kurt W\u00fcthrich of ETH Zurich, who won the 2002 Nobel chemistry prize for developing NMR to determine protein structures. But big numbers aren't enough, say vocal critics in Japan. \u201cA lot of it is junk,\u201d says Masatsune Kainosho of Tokyo Metropolitan University, reflecting the sentiment of many protein researchers contacted by  Nature . He says a lot of the structures solved so far are similar, and relatively easy: \u201cThey've gone after a lot of low-hanging fruit.\u201d The criticism is compounded by a shifting benchmark. Japan's contribution of 3,000 protein structures was supposed to form a third of about 10,000 protein folds thought to exist. That number has now jumped to 16,000 by Yokoyama's estimation and may be 30,000 according to others. Several researchers have also expressed concern that the factory approach at the NMR facility has deprived young researchers there of the skills necessary to solve more complicated and important scientific riddles. It might have \u201cdestroyed the next generation\u201d, says one. W\u00fcthrich, who helped plan the NMR centre in 1998 and was a science adviser in 2000\u201304, agrees that the facility is a wasted opportunity. \u201cA centre of that size should contribute to methodology, but there has been nothing,\u201d he says. \u201cIt became a one-man show with 40 NMR machines \u2014 there is no knowledge.\u201d Yokoyama defends his project, pointing out that Protein 3000 has cracked the structure of many signal-transduction proteins involved in disease. Supporters on the project add that it is too early to judge the value of the structures. Yokoyama points to a long list of publications and patents related to the project, but admits: \u201cWe were too busy solving structures, and didn't have time to advertise the function.\u201d Meanwhile, budget requests from the science ministry last month show a shift away from high-throughput methods, reflecting a change of policy. From next April, \u00a55 billion has been requested to develop new methods for analysing and manipulating proteins, as well as new information technologies to present and disseminate the collected data. Another \u00a52.4 billion has been requested to analyse specific disease-related proteins. Feasibility studies on candidate projects for next year will start next month, and will include a study led by Kainosho on a new method to apply NMR to larger proteins (see  Nature   440 , 52\u201357; 2006 10.1038/nature04525 ) and an exploration, led by the High Energy Accelerator Research Organization, of a microfocus X-ray beam that allows the analysis of smaller crystals. Yokoyama had hoped to continue at full speed, but now expects to lose as much as half of his previous budget for the NMR facility. \u201cIt's a very difficult situation for me and for the people working on the project,\u201d he says. To help keep his scientists busy, Yokoyama says he will seek new users from industry and from other countries. He is also working with scientists in Korea to make the NMR machines available to Asian countries that would otherwise have no access to such cutting-edge technology. \n                     Optimal isotope labelling for NMR protein structure determinations \n                   \n                     Institute doomed by loss of interest in basics \n                   \n                     National Project on Protein Structural and Functional Analyses \n                   \n                     RIKEN Genomic Sciences Center \n                   \n                     Database for Protein 3000 Project \n                   \n                     Structural-Biological Whole Cell Project \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

It has no brain, heart or nervous system. So how can researchers tell when an embryo has died? That question is likely to become a focus of debate, as scientists search for ways to create 'ethical' human embryonic stem cells. Many researchers are investigating methods for deriving such cells without destroying human embryos. Now, one group claims to have developed human embryonic stem cells from a very young embryo that had already died. Miodrag Stojkovi\u0107, who led the project at the University of Newcastle upon Tyne, UK, believes his technique may be acceptable to governments in countries such as Germany and the United States. Laws in these countries restrict the use of embryonic stem-cell lines owing to concerns about killing potential humans. Whether or not the method is judged as harmless will probably depend on whether the lives of such embryos have indisputably ended. \u201cIt will intensify the debate over how to define the death of an embryo, because now there is more at stake,\u201d says Thomas Murray, president of the Hastings Center, a bioethics research institute in Garrison, New York. During  in vitro  fertilization (IVF), well over half of human embryos arrest (stop dividing naturally), and are therefore unsuitable for transfer into women. Stojkovi\u0107, now a deputy director of the Prince Felipe Research Centre in Valencia, Spain, used 161 embryos donated by women in two local IVF clinics in his study, published online last week (X. Zhang  et al .  Stem Cells  doi:10.1634/stemcells.2006-0377; 2006). Of these embryos, 29 were developing normally until cells were extracted, 119 arrested 3\u20135 days after fertilization, and 13 arrested 6\u20137 days after fertilization. Arrested embryos were monitored for 24 to 48 hours, to check that none of the cells they contained started dividing again. In an IVF clinic, such embryos would meet the standard embryologist's criteria for having terminally arrested, and would typically be thrown away. Even in Italy, which has particularly restrictive laws stating that embryos cannot be destroyed and that all embryos created during IVF must be implanted, embryos which have arrested in this way are discarded. The team derived healthy human embryonic stem-cell lines from eight of the normally developing embryos, one of the late-arrested embryos and none of the early-arrested embryos. Although many of the cells in the arrested embryos had distorted shapes or damaged chromosomes, a few cells remained healthy. To coax these into growing, the researchers removed the 'zona pellucida' that sheaths the embryo, and used different culture conditions. The cell line from the arrested embryo seems to behave normally and can generate other tissue types, although \u201cscientists will have lingering doubts about the 'health' of the cell line, if it's derived from a poor-quality embryo,\u201d cautions stem-cell researcher George Daley of the Children's Hospital Boston in Massachusetts. Some stem-cell scientists are excited by Stojkovi\u0107's achievement. \u201cThere is no destruction of an embryo involved,\u201d says Hans Sch\u00f6ler, a director at the Max Planck Institute for Molecular Biomedicine in M\u00fcnster, Germany. \u201cIf everything is confirmed, I don't see how anyone could attack such cell lines as unethical.\u201d But others say the technique will be dogged by ambiguity over what constitutes a dead embryo. In theory, the approach is similar to harvesting organs from dead people \u2014 but in the latter case there are clearly defined criteria for proclaiming someone irreversibly brain dead. There are no such rules for an embryo. And even the remote possibility that an embryo could revive would make this procedure unacceptable to some. Donald Landry at Columbia University Medical Center, New York, is working to establish \u201cironclad\u201d criteria to define embryo death. He and co-workers have observed 444 arrested human embryos; of these, 142 had fewer cells at the five-day mark and never developed into a normal blastocyst (D. W. Landry  et al .  Regen. Med.   1,  367\u2013371; 2006). \u201cThey were truly dead,\u201d he says. Landry is now planning to study embryo death at other stages of development and to find molecules that are only produced by terminally arrested embryos. Stojkovi\u0107's technique is just the latest proposal for creating 'ethical' human embryonic stem cells. A recent  Nature  paper by Robert Lanza and colleagues from Advanced Cell Technology in Worcester, Massachusetts, sparked criticism after claiming to have made two such lines by taking single cells from embryos; they proved the principle, but did in fact destroy the embryos they used. Earlier this month, the body that operates the US National Stem Cell Bank agreed to distribute Lanza-style cell lines \u2014 if the federal government will fund research on them. But without a change in current restrictions, most US scientists are unlikely to get their hands on 'ethical' lines. Legislation known as the Dickey Amendment prevents federal money from being spent on research that harms human embryos. Even if new techniques are deemed to leap this hurdle, President George W. Bush has banned federally funded studies on any human embryonic stem-cell lines derived after 9 August 2001. James Battey, who heads the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Stem Cells Task Force, says the institutes won't seek legal advice on whether new lines could be funded until they receive a grant application for such work. But Landry hopes that embryonic stem cells derived from dead embryos might finally persuade the Bush administration to change its mind. \u201cI think it would pass muster,\u201d he says. \n                     Naturally dead embryos yield stem cells \n                   \n                     'Ethical' stem-cell paper under attack \n                   \n                     Early embryos can yield stem cells... and survive \n                   \n                     Human eggs supply 'ethical' stem cells \n                   \n                     'Ethical' routes to stem cells highlight political divide \n                   \n                     Altered embryos offered as solution to stem-cell rift \n                   \n                     Stem cells in focus \n                   \n                     Making stem cells web focus \n                   \n                     Stem cells insight \n                   \n                     Stem cells podcast \n                   \n                     25 years of embryonic stem cells \n                   \n                     US National Stem Cell Bank \n                   \n                     Advanced Cell Technology \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

High-temperature superconductivity physicists now know how he felt. If current trends continue, research into high-temperature superconductivity (high  T c ) will come to a standstill some time between 2010 and 2015, according to a report by Andreas Barth and Werner Marx, respectively at FIZ Karlsruhe and the Max Planck Institute for Solid State Research in Stuttgart, Germany. That news hasn't gone down well. Barth and Marx scoured databases owned by the Chemical Abstracts Services (CAS) and the physics and engineering abstracts service Inspec to find how interest in the field was holding up. They searched for all papers published and patents granted until the end of 2005 that involve alkaline earth cuprates containing rare earth elements. These materials show extremely low resistance to electricity at temperatures up to around \u2212200 \u00b0C. This is much warmer than temperatures normally associated with superconductors. But nobody has been able to work out how such high-temperature superconductors work. Barth and Marx plotted the falling number of publications over time, then extrapolated the results to predict that the number of publications on these compounds will drop to zero between 2010 and 2015 \u201cif no ground-breaking discoveries happen to occur\u201d. Superconductivity scientists admit the field has slowed since the flurry of research that followed Georg Bednorz and Alex M\u00fcller's 1987 Nobel prize for their discovery of ceramic high-temperature superconductors. \u201cThere was a gold rush,\u201d says Jan Zaanen of Leiden University, the Netherlands. \u201cIt's a very deep problem \u2014 all the easy things have been done.\u201d \u201cAll fields of condensed-matter physics undergo periods of ebb and flow,\u201d says Paul Grant, who has worked at IBM on high-temperature superconductors. \u201cThe general field of superconductivity is wide open.\u201d After high-temperature superconductivity was discovered there was a huge spike in publications. Dreams of creating levitating trains, making a fortune and getting a Nobel prize for finding out how these systems work kept the field alive for a while. But as problems remained unsolved, people started to leave. \u201cHigh  T c  made me feel old,\u201d says Zaanen. Only the diehards remained, he says, some of whom acquired reputations for having large egos and even making superconductivity something of a religion. Zaanen claims those egos have been toned down but says the field is still too intimidating to attract young blood. Barth and Marx did not include such influences as these in their study. Marx says his aim was to \u201cdemonstrate the potential of databases and search systems for generating meta-information that could be interesting in a specific field\u201d. As a piece of scientometrics the work is robust, according to Paul Peters, who works at the CAS: \u201cGiven the fact that multiple sources and different approaches all indicate the same demise, I would think this is quite accurate.\u201d But he warns: \u201cScience may prove them wrong.\u201d There are signs that high-temperature superconductivity could be having a resurgence. The US Department of Energy's basic energy sciences office recently ran a workshop on superconductivity. Pat Dehmer, the office's associate director, says: \u201cFunding will be very seriously considered for this field,\u201d although she remains coy about revealing details before the federal budget announcement in February. A demonstration project using high-temperature superconductor wires in the US national energy grid is also starting this year. Marx agrees that the field could revive given a breakthrough such as the discovery of superconductors that work at even higher temperatures or are in a new class of materials, or the development of a theoretical explanation of the phenomenon. He also admits that his study has limitations. \u201cExtrapolations are always problematic,\u201d he says. \u201cThe word 'zero' is perhaps not an optimal expression here. It may be taken seriously but certainly not literally.\u201d That doesn't stop some from taking the conclusion personally. The extrapolation is \u201cutter nonsense\u201d according to Zaanen. \u201cIt's a vivid illustration of the blindness of bean counting.\u201d \n                     Superconductivity: Pairing glue or inelastic tunnelling? \n                   \n                     Hot superconductors, 20 years on \n                   \n                     Wires find path of least resistance \n                   \n                     Physics@nature.com \n                   \n                     Basic Energy Sciences workshop reports \n                   \n                     Jan Zaanen \n                   \n                     Bednorz\u2013M\u00fcller Nobel Prize \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

When two Spanish researchers checked the statistics in scientific papers from the  BMJ  and  Nature  in 2004, their results prompted a flurry of headlines and soul-searching for editors. \u201cSloppy stats shame science\u201d ran the headline in  The Economist . \u201cStatistical flaws revealed in top journals' papers\u201d declared  New Scientist . The revelation that more than a third of all  Nature  papers in 2001 contained statistical errors prompted the journal to introduce new checks on quality. At the  BMJ  (formerly the  British Medical Journal ), where one in four papers was found to contain flaws, editors ran an editorial discussing potential solutions. Now it seems that another manuscript can be added to the pile of flawed publications: the paper by the Spanish researchers. According to an analysis published earlier this month, one of its two conclusions is invalid because it is based on inappropriate statistics. \u201cStatistical tests should be used correctly,\u201d notes the dry conclusion of the new paper. The test in question was employed by ecologists Emili Garc\u00eda-Berthou and Carles Alcaraz from the University of Girona to assess the use of rounding. If rounded correctly, the final digit of a number quoted to three or four significant figures should have an equal chance of being any digit between zero and nine. Garc\u00eda-Berthou and Alcaraz found that fours and nines appeared less frequently than expected, perhaps because researchers have an unconscious preference for rounding to five and zero, respectively (E. Garc\u00eda-Berthou and C. Alcaraz  BMC Med. Res. Methodol.   4,  13; 2004). But Monwhea Jeng, a physicist at Syracuse University in New York, points out that Garc\u00eda-Berthou and Alcaraz employed the Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov test, which is used to evaluate whether the probability distributions underlying two sets of numbers differ. Jeng says this was a mistake, because the test assumes that the distributions involved are continuous; in the case of the final digit of a number, the distribution is discrete. He says a more appropriate analysis using a chi-squared test shows no evidence of rounding errors (M. Jeng  BMC Med. Res. Methodol.   6,  45; 2006). Two independent statisticians contacted by  Nature  say Jeng's analysis seems to be correct, and a referee report, posted on the journal's website, indicates that use of a different statistical package confirmed Jeng's conclusion. But Garc\u00eda-Berthou insists his use of the test was appropriate, and says he will explain why in a letter to the journal. The argument could be viewed as no more than amusingly ironic, especially because Jeng's analysis does not affect Garc\u00eda-Berthou and Alcaraz's second and perhaps more important discovery: that many  P  values in  Nature  and  BMJ  papers were wrongly calculated. But the incident does illustrate the difficulty of assessing whether statistical tests have been properly used, especially given that scientists well trained in statistics do not always agree. \u201cIf a journal doesn't have enough expertise it's a real problem,\u201d says Steve Goodman, a medical statistician and editor at the  Annals of Internal Medicine . He says he rarely sees papers that are free of flaws. \u201cI view most of the literature as done wrong.\u201d A study published this July, for example, examines the use of  P  values in paper abstracts (P. C. G\u00f8tzsche  BMJ   333,  231\u2013234; 2006). The paper concludes: \u201cSignificant results in abstracts are common but should generally be disbelieved.\u201d \n                     Drug trials: Stacking the deck \n                   \n                     Journals submit to scrutiny of their peer-review process \n                   \n                     Industry money skews drug overviews \n                   \n                     Double check casts doubt on statistics in published papers \n                   \n                     Scientific publishing: Peer review, unmasked \n                   \n                     Emili Garc\u00eda-Berthou \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

A three-dimensional map of gene expression in the mouse brain, the atlas is the most comprehensive study of its kind to date. A personal interest in neuroscience saw Paul Allen, the billionaire philanthropist who co-founded Microsoft, establish the Allen Institute for Brain Science in Seattle, Washington, in 2001. He donated $100 million: half went on the Brain Atlas, launched in 2003 as the institute's first major project after two years of consultation. Researchers mapped where each of the mouse brain's 21,000 genes are expressed by staining brain sections with probes specific to each gene. The resulting atlas provides insight into the brain's function, helping researchers understand how different regions operate and interact. Allan Jones, chief scientific officer at the Allen Institute, is confident that the atlas will \u201cdramatically propel neuroscience forwards\u201d. The atlas is available free of charge online in the form of a database. Users can search for particular genes, then scroll through photographs of vertical or horizontal sections to see how expression is distributed. The completed atlas contains around 85 million images and 600 terabytes of data \u2014 enough to fill more than 7,500 top-of-the-range iPods. The mice used in the Allen Brain Atlas were all 56 days old. An alternative project, the Gene Expression Nervous System Atlas (GENSAT), launched by the US National Institutes of Health in 2003, is mapping gene expression in the mouse brain throughout development. The project has begun to publish results but is still some way from completion. Much of the Allen Brain Atlas information was released before the project was completed, and researchers in the field already seem pleased with the resource. According to the Allen Institute for Brain Science, 250 scientists are using the atlas each day, and it is turning up in citations. \u201cCombining the classical approaches of brain research with this new genetic approach is a breakthrough in neuroscience,\u201d says Susumu Tonegawa, director of the Picower Center for Learning and Memory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. \u201cIt's an extremely powerful approach to try to understand the brain.\u201d \u201cThis will likely become the reference atlas for molecular and cellular neuroscientists,\u201d adds Thomas Insel, director of the National Institute of Mental Health in Bethesda, Maryland. He says the atlas has already produced two surprising results: \u201cFirst, the percentage of genes expressed in the adult brain is greater than we had expected, and second, the regional distribution is more selective than expected.\u201d Alongside data on gene expression, the atlas provides an anatomical map of the mouse brain. Charles Watson is an expert on brain mapping, currently working with George Paxinos to produce the sixth edition of  The Rat Brain in Stereotaxic Coordinates  \u2014 one of the most cited texts in the field. \u201cThe project is doing a really good thing and it's fantastic that someone has invested so much money in neuroscience,\u201d he says. But Watson notes that the makers of the mouse atlas have chosen a different set of abbreviations from those in Paxinos' books. \u201cWe have the  lingua franca  and they're refusing to use it, which seems a bit silly,\u201d he says. Mice are an important model species in neuroscience research, due in part to their potential for genetic manipulation and drug testing not possible in humans. A corresponding atlas of the human brain is an obvious next step, however, and the Allen Institute has initiated pilot studies towards this end. \u201cWe plan to address key questions about the human brain and will be focusing our internal research efforts on understanding the cortex \u2014 the part of the brain associated with 'higher order' functions,\u201d says Jones. \n                 http://www.brainatlas.org/aba \n               \n                     A gene expression atlas of the central nervous system based on bacterial artificial chromosomes \n                   \n                     Neuroscience Gateway \n                   \n                     Neuroscience@nature.com \n                   \n                     The Allen Institute for Brain Science \n                   \n                     The Allen Brain Atlas \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

After decades of being shunned as an environmentally damaging chemical, the pesticide DDT is once again being touted as the most effective way to fight malaria. The World Health Organization (WHO) announced on 15 September that it will support the indoor spraying of pesticides generally, and DDT specifically, to control mosquitoes in countries with high rates of malaria. The US Agency for International Development signalled a similar shift in policy back in May. Although these agencies never formally opposed DDT, they did not fund countries to purchase it, and instead actively promoted the use of insecticide-treated bednets. Malaria rates have continued to rise in the meantime, claiming more than a million lives a year, mostly in sub-Saharan Africa. The agencies now advocate combining the two approaches. \u201cI have to pinch myself a little to believe that they've done this, but I'm really, really happy they have,\u201d says Amir Attaran, professor of law and medicine at the University of Ottawa, Canada, who has long criticized the agencies for their malaria policies. In sharp contrast to its previous stance, the WHO also admitted for the first time that it stopped supporting DDT despite evidence of its effectiveness. \u201cThere are lots of data there, but people are so emotional about the issues,\u201d says Arata Kochi, director of the WHO's Global Malaria Programme. \u201cScience comes first and we must take a position based on the science and the data.\u201d DDT, or dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane, is an organochlorine that is more effective, cheaper and longer-lasting than the alternatives. Fears about its use date back to the 1960s when Rachel Carson's book,  Silent Spring , famously chronicled its devastating effects on the environment. In the years that followed, the United States and many European countries banned DDT. These countries once used thousands of tonnes of the pesticide for agricultural purposes. But the use of DDT for malaria control is very different: small quantities are sprayed once or twice a year on the inside walls and ceilings of houses. Following widely publicized success with DDT in some countries such as India and South Africa, others began clamouring for the pesticide. \u201cA lot of countries, especially in southern Africa, have become bullish about the use of DDT,\u201d says Richard Tren of the non-profit group Africa Fighting Malaria. Even environmental groups that once vehemently opposed DDT recognize its value in malaria control. \u201cWe still think that DDT is trouble,\u201d says Ed Hopkins, director of the environmental quality programme at the Sierra Club, a conservation group based in San Francisco. \u201cBut in some situations, where there are no alternatives, the well controlled use of DDT is better than having millions of people die from malaria.\u201d Other groups say they are concerned that the agencies are not dedicating enough resources to developing longer-term alternatives to DDT. \u201cDDT is a short-sighted response with long-term consequences,\u201d says Paul Saoke, director of Physicians for Social Responsibility in Kenya. Before countries can begin using DDT, the WHO must map resistance to pesticides to determine where spraying is likely to be effective and which pesticide would be best. Spraying won't work where mosquitoes bite and rest outdoors. And in most cases, mosquitoes \u2014 and with them, malaria \u2014 will return as soon as spraying stops, so the programmes require long-term commitment from both governments and donors. But these practical hurdles can be tackled, says Kochi. \u201cSo many people took the position that even though DDT and indoor residual spraying are effective, it cannot be sustained,\u201d he says. \u201cMy sense is, nothing is sustainable unless you decide to make it so. People make excuses.\u201d Kochi, who also set up the Stop TB Initiative, is largely credited with the changes in the WHO's approach. Shortly after he took this job in October 2005, he demanded that pharmaceutical companies stop marketing single-drug artemisinin medicines, and only sell combination drugs, in order to prevent resistance. \u201cThe breath of fresh air this man represents is just tremendous,\u201d says Attaran. \u201cHe's perfect for this job.\u201d \n                     DDT returns \n                   \n                     Profile: Amir Attaran \n                   \n                     Medical research news channel \n                   \n                     Malaria web focus \n                   \n                     Malaria special \n                   \n                     WHO malaria page \n                   \n                     Wikipedia on DDT \n                   \n                     Rachel Carson \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Lawyers defending six medical workers who risk execution by firing squad in Libya have called for the international scientific community to support a bid to prove the medics' innocence. The six are charged with deliberately infecting more than 400 children with HIV at the al-Fateh Hospital in Benghazi in 1998, so far causing the deaths of at least 40 of them. On 28 August, when the prosecution was scheduled to close its case, the Libyan prosecutor called for the five Bulgarian nurses and a Palestinian doctor to be sentenced to death. Attorneys from Lawyers Without Borders, who are handling the defence of the six, have responded by calling for the international community to request that the court order an independent scientific assessment, by international AIDS experts, of how the children became infected. The medics were condemned to death in May 2004, but the Supreme Court quashed their convictions last December, following international protests that the first trial had been unfair. It ordered a retrial, which has run intermittently since 11 May at the Criminal Court of Benghazi, based in Tripoli. A verdict is expected within weeks. But the scientific community has so far shown relatively little interest in the case, says Emmanuel Altit, a member of the Paris bar and a volunteer with Lawyers Without Borders, who has in the past defended inmates at Guantanamo Bay. \u201cWe have knocked on a lot of doors, but we have not had much help; we hope this will change.\u201d One reason for the lack of interest, he says, is the widespread notion that the trial is a sideshow, and that the \u201creal decisions\u201d will be made by diplomats (see  page 245 ). Altit argues that diplomacy has so far failed to secure results, and that the medics' release will only be secured by using scientific evidence to fight the case in the Tripoli courtroom. He hopes that exposing the \u201cemptiness\u201d of the prosecution case will ramp up enough international pressure to force governments to take action. At present, the case has been sidelined by broader geopolitical interests in the opening of oil-rich Libya to international relations, says Antoine Alexiev, another defence lawyer on the case. The United States decided in May to re-establish diplomatic relations with Libya. And Muammar Gaddafi, the Libyan leader, has been given red-carpet treatment at the European Union's headquarters in Brussels \u2014 without mention of the medics' situation. \n               First report \n             During the first trial, the Libyan government did ask Luc Montagnier, whose group at the Pasteur Institute in Paris discovered HIV, and Vittorio Colizzi, an AIDS researcher at Rome's Tor Vergata University, to examine the scientific evidence. The researchers carried out a genetic analysis of viruses from the infected children, and concluded that many of them were infected long before the medics set foot in Libya in March 1998. Many of the children were also infected with hepatitis B and C, suggesting that the infections were spread by poor hospital hygiene. The infections were caused by subtypes of A/G HIV-1 \u2014 a recombinant strain common in central and west Africa, known to be highly infectious. But the court threw out the report, arguing that an investigation by Libyan doctors had reached the opposite conclusion. Montagnier believes the judgement was based at least partly on mistranslation from English to Arabic of the term 'recombinant' \u2014 instead of referring to natural recombination of wild viruses, as intended, it was interpreted to mean genetically modified, implying human manipulation. According to Alexiev, the decision to throw out the report removed all scientific content from the case, leaving a series of prejudgements, and confessions extracted under torture. \u201cIt's scandalous,\u201d he says. \u201cThis is a complex scientific affair, and it is impossible to judge it without a scientific basis.\u201d Montagnier, whose efforts helped secure a retrial in the first place, says he too is upset by how events in Tripoli are progressing. \u201cIt's a rerun of the first trial,\u201d he says. \u201cIt's embarassing politically for Gaddafi, but there is the pressure of the parents, who absolutely need to find a scapegoat. Of course this can't be the Libyans, so it falls on the medics.\u201d The defence is scheduled to plead on 21 September, but Altit is not convinced that the science will be fairly heard. All attempts by the defence to present its arguments have been \u201csystematically blocked\u201d, he claims, for example by switching the schedule. \u201cThe trial should be fair and equitable; until now it has been anything but.\u201d Legally, the Montagnier/Colizzi report cannot be reinstated after having been thrown out, so the defence is pinning its hopes on persuading the court to appoint an independent science panel to produce a new report. The Tripoli court has resisted all such calls, says Alexiev. \u201cWe are hitting a wall, and that is unlikely to change before the end of this trial.\u201d The defence is therefore resigned to probably losing the current trial, he says, and is setting its sights on the six's last chance: a final appeal in the Supreme Court, which could convene immediately after the Tripoli verdict, currently expected in November. \u201cWe need to convince the Supreme Court to nominate that international scientific assessment,\u201d he says. \u201cIf international pressure isn't stronger before the appeal, the risk is large that they will be condemned to death,\u201d predicts Michel Taube, co-founder of Together Against the Death Penalty, a French non-governmental organization. \u201cTo avoid that outcome, diplomacy is not enough. We need international mobilization.\u201d Only a combined pressure from lawyers and scientists as well as politicians will make a difference, agrees Altit. If the Supreme Court refuses a scientific assessment, then the international community will be able to ask: \u201cWhat has it got to hide?\u201d he says. \u201cAnd if it agrees to a scientific investigation, then we will win.\u201d \n                     Light shed on battle against HIV \n                   \n                     US aid for AIDS \n                   \n                     AIDS meeting urged to rethink prevention strategy \n                   \n                     A true test of leadership \n                   \n                     Avocats Sans Fronti\u00e8res, France \n                   \n                     Support organization for imprisoned medics \n                   \n                     Amnesty International on Libya \n                   \n                     WHO site on AIDS in Africa \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Tokyo On 1 September, Yasuo Kawasaki, a 42-year-old assistant professor at Osaka University, was found dead in his lab after ingesting poison. The investigation into the case so far has left many questions unanswered \u2014 including whether the death was connected to a recently withdrawn article on which Kawasaki was a co-author. That paper suggested that a type of DNA helicase called MCM2p plays an important role in DNA replication (W. Nakai  et al .  J. Biol. Chem.  10.1074/jbc.M603586200; 2006). It was published online on 12 July. But on 2 August, the journal marked it as \u201cwithdrawn\u201d. Osaka University began an investigation on 9 August into whether the paper contained false data. In the midst of the inquiry, Kawasaki's body was found \u2014 police suspect that his death was a suicide, although they are still working on the case. Many who knew Kawasaki have expressed surprise and shock at his death. \u201cHe was a talented young scientist,\u201d says John Diffley, an expert in DNA replication at Cancer Research UK's London Research Institute, who knew him since Kawasaki was a postdoc at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York. \u201cHis career seemed to be going very well.\u201d Hisato Kondoh, dean of the Graduate School of Frontier Biosciences at Osaka, dismisses any suspicion that Kawasaki might have killed himself after being caught engaging in scientific misconduct. \u201cThe person who committed suicide was not involved in scientific fraud,\u201d he says. Kondoh declined to comment further on the ongoing investigation into the paper, saying only that the results will be made public when they are complete. But the events leading up to the withdrawal of the paper are far from clear.  Nature  has learned that Akio Sugino, head of Kawasaki's lab and corresponding author on the paper, had submitted it for publication without checking with all of his co-authors. According to Japanese press reports, Kawasaki subsequently found that some of his data had been changed, so he asked Sugino to withdraw the article, and informed Kondoh. The university is also investigating several other related papers from the group. Sugino was not available for comment. Robert Simoni, deputy editor of the  Journal of Biological Chemistry , also declined  Nature 's request for information about why the paper was withdrawn, and refused to clarify how a withdrawal differs from a retraction. But scientists in the field describe Sugino as well respected and of high integrity \u2014 \u201ca venerable old hand at DNA replication\u201d as Diffley puts it. Some of the details surrounding Kawasaki's death are also mysterious. Although suicide is relatively common in Japan, the cause of death tends to be hanging or gassing. Kawasaki died from ingesting sodium azide, a white, odourless solid that causes convulsions and respiratory failure within minutes. Such a method of suicide is extremely rare in Japan, according to National Police Agency statistics. The suicide note was also unusual \u2014 rather than being handwritten, it was printed out from a computer. And despite being addressed to his family, it was found, along with an empty container of sodium azide, in the lab where Kawasaki's body was discovered. According to the Osaka police department, the note was an explanation of Kawasaki's emotions. It did not mention the withdrawn paper or specific problems at work. It began: \u201cThings at work have settled down. I want to resolve the problem.\u201d When asked about rumours that there was intense pressure on Kawasaki before his death, Kondoh said that measures had been in place to protect whistleblowers since the beginning of the incident. He added that there is no evidence of a connection between the apparent suicide and the withdrawn paper. Japanese universities often respond slowly to suspicions of fraud, and aren't known for their transparency. Diffley says he now hopes Osaka will buck that trend. \u201cI really hope the university gets to the bottom of what happened,\u201d he says. \u201cIt will be a shame if it is a whitewash.\u201d He points out that without a definitive investigation result, rumours of misconduct could blight the whole group. \u201cThe careers of many scientists will be affected.\u201d Kiyoshi Kurokawa, president of the Science Council of Japan, agrees. \u201cJapanese universities and institutions may not always take the right approach to resolving problems,\u201d he says. \u201cBut do they realize that the science community around the world is watching?\u201d \n                     Misconduct has ripple effects beyond the perpetrator \n                   \n                     Further accusations rock Japanese RNA laboratory \n                   \n                     Should journals police scientific fraud? \n                   \n                     Doubts over biochemist's data expose holes in Japanese fraud laws \n                   \n                     Woo Suk Hwang \u2013 News Special \n                   \n                     Osaka University \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Washington DC The US National Institutes of Health (NIH) has successfully switched to a new ethical culture and is spending millions on ensuring that rules about employee investments and outside activities are obeyed \u2014 according to a top agency official. \u201cThere have been some bumps in the road, but most people would say it has gone reasonably well,\u201d says Raynard Kington, deputy director of the biomedical agency, which is based in Bethesda, Maryland. Not everyone agrees. Kington was speaking to  Nature  two days after a hearing on 13 September in which unhappy congressmen grilled him and other agency officials. One described the NIH as an \u201cethical Potemkin village where a hollow system appears to provide the illusion of integrity\u201d. \u201cThe NIH has changed its rules and that's a good thing, but they don't appear to really be doing anything to enforce the old rules against their most serious transgressors,\u201d said Republican congressman Joe Barton of Texas, chairman of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce. The committee's investigative subcommittee had summoned Kington and others to raise concerns about NIH management. New ethics rules came into force at the agency one year ago (see  Nature   437 , 9; 200510.1038/437009a ), after a series of revelations about lucrative consultancy payments from companies collected by senior NIH scientists, often as they worked with or promoted the companies' drugs. Under pressure from Congress, NIH director Elias Zerhouni banned employees from doing any outside consulting for pharmaceutical and biotechnology firms. The new rules also force senior scientists to limit stockholdings in biomedical companies to $15,000. No scientists may hold shares in companies directly related to their research. Kington told  Nature  that the agency has had \u201cvery high compliance with the new rules\u201d and that he hasn't had to take any disciplinary action. He adds that the agency is investing several million dollars in improving relevant databases, and that he is about to hire a chief ethics officer to monitor compliance. Within the NIH there seems to be resigned acceptance of the rules. One senior agency scientist, who asked not to be identified, says that generally the rules \u201cdon't change most people's day-to-day life. The NIH is still a really good place to work. You can do your research.\u201d But there has been an impact on morale. \u201cWe feel that Zerhouni didn't cover our backs,\u201d says the scientist. \u201cAdmitting we had to change the rules \u2014 it was almost like tacit agreement that there were pervasive problems with the system. And I don't think that any of us feel that was the case.\u201d NIH spokesman John Burklow counters that view. \u201cDr Zerhouni defended the agency and its scientists through public statements and at congressional hearings,\u201d he says. At last week's congressional hearing, the agency was tackled about two researchers who remain on the NIH payroll despite recommendations from their institute directors that they be fired. An internal investigation found that Trey Sunderland, an Alzheimer's researcher, accepted more than $700,000 in consulting fees without disclosing them to his bosses, in violation of existing NIH rules. And Thomas Walsh, an infectious-disease specialist, received more than $100,000 in unapproved consulting and speaking payments from 25 companies (see  'Scientists hit back at the press' ). Both men have declined to comment. The NIH doesn't have the authority to fire either of them because they are formally employed by the Commissoned Corps, a branch of the Public Health Service. To dismiss them, the corps must convene a board of inquiry. John Agwunobi, assistant secretary for health, told the subcommittee that it did so for Sunderland early this year, but added that because criminal charges are being considered against Sunderland, the board has been put on indefinite hold. Agwunobi, who oversees the corps, said that a board of inquiry was convened early this month to hear the Walsh case. That didn't seem to satisfy his interrogators. \u201cIn both these cases, we are troubled about whether the NIH and the Commissioned Corps acted appropriately,\u201d said Republican congressman Ed Whitfield of Kentucky, subcommittee chairman. \u201cBoth the corps and the NIH seem passive, taking the minimal steps to enforce the rules that are the foundation of maintaining public trust.\u201d \n                     NIH rolls back financial conflict rules \n                   \n                     Use of NIH funds placed under a spotlight \n                   \n                     Agency under siege \n                   \n                     NIH workers see red over revised rules for conflicts of interest \n                   \n                     Medical research news channel \n                   \n                     NIH Ethics Programme \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Preventing disease has always lacked the prestige of curing it. Now advocates for public health are concerned that the field is being further undermined by dissent behind the doors of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), one of the world's highest-profile public-health agencies. And many fear that if the United States is faced with a health crisis \u2014 an outbreak of pandemic flu, say, or the next SARS \u2014 the cracks will become chasms. The federal agency, which works to combat outbreaks of infectious disease and chronic conditions such as diabetes, has seen discontent grow in the past few years over a lengthy reorganization. Concerns resurfaced earlier this month after the  Atlanta Journal-Constitution  revealed that five former CDC directors had sent a letter of concern about staff morale to the agency's director, Julie Gerberding, last December. The article sparked a record 90,000 hits and a flurry of discussion on a blog that discusses CDC internal affairs ( http://www.cdcchatter.net ) and in wider public-health circles. According to a crude poll on the site, 82% of voters agreed that the newspaper article accurately reflected the situation at the agency. Established 60 years ago, the CDC has long been known for its expertise in investigating infectious outbreaks. But after the anthrax attacks of autumn 2001, many acknowledged that the agency needed a shake-up because its 11 national centres of expertise lacked coordination, communication and efficiency. Gerberding launched her reorganization, called the Futures Initiative, in June 2003, a year after taking office. Complaints soon began when some employees felt they were being sucked into multiple, officious committees. And when the new structure was announced in spring 2004, some were dismayed at the introduction of four coordinating centres that, critics say, created an extra layer of management between scientists and the director and stripped senior scientists of control over their budgets. Many CDC employees are reluctant to talk openly about their concerns \u2014 and public-health experts outside the agency are also reticent because they are often closely linked with, or receive money from, the agency. But privately, CDC employees say they are demoralized by the reorganization because it has introduced extra bureaucracy, lowered the status of science and placed too much emphasis on 'spin'. They say these changes, and the new corporate management style, are ill-suited to an agency that is supposed to investigate and protect public health. \u201cThe message from the current leadership is that the important scientific issues are decided elsewhere; we just have to look good to the media and not challenge conventional wisdom,\u201d says one senior public-health researcher at the CDC. The sour situation is thought to be one reason behind a wave of high-level departures: at least eight directors of the former national centres of expertise have left since 2004. The repercussions are being felt both nationally and internationally, because the CDC plays a central role in coordinating public health across state and local health departments, as well as international responses to emerging infectious diseases. \u201cMost people in public health are very concerned to see this level of a brain drain in the CDC,\u201d says Jeffrey Levi, head of Trust for America's Health, a non-profit organization based in Washington DC that works to promote disease prevention. Observers lay some of the blame on the Bush administration, which they say encouraged the agency to focus on preparation for bio-terrorism at the expense of other needs. \u201cAll the emphasis was on terrorism, without willingness to recognize that the public-health infrastructure has been getting weaker for years,\u201d says Anthony Robbins, a professor of public health at Tufts University in Boston. In the 2006 financial year, the CDC received funding boosts for bioterror and pandemic-flu planning while many chronic-disease prevention programmes were cut. The accusation that politics is usurping science has also reared its head. Critics say pressure from the administration stops the agency from investigating pressing public-health issues, such as whether abstinence-only programmes work in the fight against HIV or whether junk food is fuelling the obesity epidemic. \u201cThere is not a feeling that science drives the agenda,\u201d says a senior official who left the CDC more than five years ago. Others are critical of Gerberding herself for not resisting these political pressures and fighting for the agency's agenda. The fear now is for what would happen if the country had to deal with a public-health crisis. Many in the field draw parallels between the CDC and the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the organization so heavily criticized over its inadequate response to Hurricane Katrina. \u201cOur preparedness has been deteriorating in fairly dramatic and drastic ways,\u201d says Phyllis Freeman, who specializes in public-health policy at the University of Massachusetts, Boston. But CDC spokesman Tom Skinner says that \u201cthere is no merit whatsoever\u201d in the argument that the agency cannot protect public health. He says most employees understand that the agency needs to change and they have been thoroughly involved in the process. He adds that Gerberding and the agency's executive management are aware that some employees are unhappy with the reorganization and that, starting later this month, two people will be hired as ombudsmen to deal with some of their concerns. Gerberding was not available for comment. Critics offer no clear solution for the CDC's woes, although some want Gerberding replaced with a stronger advocate for public health. \u201cYou can't manage a place where people don't trust you,\u201d says one CDC employee. Robbins says he hopes to propose a 'strike fund' for public-health workers who want to speak out about their concerns \u2014 to cover wages or legal costs for anyone who loses their job as a result. Troubles at the CDC are symptomatic of the persistently low profile that the United States gives to public health, a field that is sometimes sidelined politically and financially when compared with research in new drugs.

Israeli physicists have turned a laser into a particle accelerator. Dubbed a paser \u2014 for particle acceleration by stimulated emission of radiation \u2014 the device accelerates bundles of electrons using the same principle as a laser. At present it can only accelerate electrons by about 0.15% of their initial speed, but it could lead to compact particle accelerators and tabletop X-ray devices, according to Samer Banna of the Israel Institute of Technology in Haifa. He and his colleagues will publish their work in  Physical Review Letters . Conventional lasers exploit the quantum properties of atoms. An energy source is used to boost the electrons in a group of atoms into an elevated energy state. Passing light in the form of photons stimulates the atoms and causes the electrons to fall back to the lower energy level, emitting more photons in the process. These in turn stimulate more atoms and so on, so that a large number of photons are emitted. The photons are all identical, which makes the beam of light uniform. Pasers work on a similar principle, but the output is accelerated electrons. Packets of electrons are fired into a cloud of excited carbon dioxide gas. As in a laser, the gas releases a large number of identical photons. But those photons are instantly absorbed by the passing electrons, which get an energetic kick, and leave the device moving more quickly than when they came in. The fact that the paser uses atoms to speed up electrons sets it apart from other particle accelerators. \u201cThis is unlike anything that's come before,\u201d says Eric Colby of the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center in California. The unique mode of action makes the paser far more efficient than current machines, which achieve acceleration by generating enormous electric fields inside huge cavities. Colby is optimistic about the paser's potential. \u201cIt's a pretty small effect now,\u201d he says, \u201cbut there are strong technical reasons to believe that a very significant gain in acceleration is possible.\u201d Levi Sch\u00e4chter, of the Israel Institute of Technology, believes that the paser could also make its mark as a source of X-rays. If the high-speed electrons have their paths bent after they leave the device, they will release a laser-like beam of X-rays that could be used for medical or nanotechnology applications. But Sch\u00e4chter is reluctant to guess exactly what may come of the technology. \u201cIn Hebrew we say, 'It's difficult to make predictions, particularly regarding the future'.\u201d It wouldn't be possible to produce the exact equivalent of a laser beam with electrons \u2014 the Pauli exclusion principle states that electrons cannot exist in the same energy state at the same time. But laser equivalents can in theory be created for other types of particle, such as gravitons (which carry the gravitational force), phonons (packets of vibration) or some nuclei \u2014 if a system can be found that emits them. In June, for example, a group of researchers reported building a sound laser, or saser, that uses semiconductor technology to create a uniform beam of phonons (A. J. Kent  et al .  Phys. Rev. Lett.   96,  215504; 2006). Colby says that these new systems show that it is easier than one might think to generate laser-like behaviour. \u201cIf you can store energy in a material,\u201d he says, \u201ca great many things can be done.\u201d \n                     Get laser-like beams from salt \n                   \n                     Lasers trigger cleaner fusion \n                   \n                     Silicon laser runs non-stop \n                   \n                     Physical sciences news channel \n                   \n                     2005: Year of physics \n                   \n                     Future computing in focus \n                   \n                     Levi Sch\u00e4chter on pasers \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Ashburn, Virginia Designers overlooked one small flaw when they drew up plans for Janelia Farm, the new $500-million facility for the Howard Hughes Medical Institute in Virginia. Deer, unaware of their new neighbour built into the side of a hill, started leaping over the structure to their deaths. The deer soon wised up. But Janelia's \u00e9lite group of investigators may hope they aren't taking a comparable leap into the unknown by joining this unusual laboratory. Janelia Farm, which welcomed its first few investigators in August, trumpets itself as a rare institutional model for innovative biomedical research. The lure, including smart labs, has drawn 16 leading scientists so far, most in neurobiology and image processing, with 44 expected by 2009. Many surrendered the comforts of tenure for this cutting-edge facility, which pushes scientists to think big and take chances on interdisciplinary collaborations. But there are risks. Investigators will be reviewed after six years initially, and subsequently every five years. If a panel of outside experts finds the research to be too conventional or progress insufficient, the investigator will be kicked out \u2014 albeit with two years of additional funding to soften the blow. \u201cThe deal is: you bet your career,\u201d says director Gerry Rubin, \u201cand I bet $10 million.\u201d Those who have come to Janelia are an idiosyncratic bunch. They include Gene Myers, a shotgun gene-sequencing pioneer who gave up tenure at the University of California, Berkeley, to come. Eric Betzig started as a physicist at New Jersey's famed Bell Laboratories before working at his family's machine-tool business for eight years. Sean Eddy, a computational biologist, arrived from a tenured genetics position at Washington University in St Louis, Missouri. By any metric, Janelia is an impressive lab space. The building is carved into a hill about 60 kilometres west of Washington DC, with each floor in the large, multi-level terrace being at ground level. Labs are walled in with thick glass from floor to ceiling, and a modular design allows them to be easily reconfigured to suit an investigator's needs. The campus also boasts a gym, 50 apartments and a daycare facility. There's also a pub, complete with free coffee to entice people together and a whiteboard for spontaneous brainstorms. It's all part of a social-engineering project, painstakingly designed to stimulate social interactions and spark informal research discussions. Rubin, a  Drosophila  geneticist who is moving his lab to Janelia from the University of California, Berkeley, based Janelia loosely on the open laboratories of Bell Labs and the Medical Research Council's Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge, UK. Groups are no bigger than six members, to encourage interdisciplinary collaboration that relies on field experts rather than graduate students or postdocs. This should also ensure that group leaders are active bench scientists rather than just managers, says Rubin. The glass walls help too, by letting researchers see who's in and what they're doing. At Bio-X, a similar suite of glass-walled labs at Stanford University in California, few have complained about the lack of privacy, says its operations director Heideh Fattaey. But some have set up whiteboards to block off space. \u201cYou can't change human nature,\u201d she says. In-house architect Bob McGhee, who helped to design the labs at Janelia, acknowledges that they are not suitable for researchers conducting, for example, ethically sensitive animal studies. Rubin insists that he doesn't want to replicate other institutes, no matter how successful or prestigious they may be. \u201cMy greatest failure would be if this turns into another Salk or Whitehead,\u201d he says. Interdisciplinary labs may be trendy, but placing physicists next to biologists doesn't necessarily spark a revolution. \u201cThere's not as much real collaboration as one would think,\u201d says Janelia group leader Loren Looger, a protein-engineering researcher with a background in maths and chemistry, who has also worked at Bio-X. But Janelia should prove more successful, he says, as group leaders, already proficient in multiple disciplines, will not have to worry about defending unconventional research to secure tenure \u2014 sometimes a problem in academia. \u201cIt may fail,\u201d says Looger. Nevertheless, he revels in being part of the Janelia experiment. \n                     Eric Betzig \n                   \n                     Capital collaboration Washington DC \n                   \n                     Janelia Farm \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

The question of whether outwardly unresponsive patients may in fact be aware of their surroundings is one of the most heated debates in clinical neuroscience, with huge implications for the way such patients are diagnosed and treated. In a remarkable study published last week, researchers report that a patient who meets all the criteria of being in a 'vegetative state' can perform mental tasks on request. But the case highlights the difficulty of probing the mental state of an individual who cannot communicate, and of drawing any general conclusions about his or her condition. Adrian Owen of the Medical Research Council's Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit in Cambridge, UK, and his colleagues used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to scan the brain of a 23-year-old woman left in a vegetative state after a car accident in July 2005. Such patients do not respond to their surroundings, and doctors have always assumed that they are completely unaware of them. Previous brain-scanning studies have failed to detect more than reflex reactions to stimuli such as sound or pain. Owen and his colleagues now show that their patient can respond to verbal requests to picture herself either playing tennis or walking around her house. Each activity produces a different pattern of brain activation, and these are strikingly similar to those of healthy volunteers (A. M. Owen  et al .  Science   313 , 1402; 2006). The decision to comply with the experimenter's instructions proves awareness, says Owen. \u201cWhat we've developed is a method for detecting when someone is aware in the absence of other clinical evidence.\u201d But what that 'awareness' means is still up for debate. For example, Paul Matthews, a clinical neuroscientist at Imperial College London, argues that the brain imaging technique used cannot evaluate conscious thought; fMRI lights up regions of brain activity by identifying hotspots of oxygen consumption by neurons. \u201cIt helps us identify regions associated with a task, but not which regions are necessary or sufficient for performing that task,\u201d he says. Matthews argues that the patient's brain could have been responding automatically to the word 'tennis', rather than consciously imagining a game. He also points out that in many vegetative cases, the patient's motor system seems to be undamaged, so he questions why, if they are conscious, they do not respond physically. \u201cThey are simply not behaving as if they are conscious,\u201d he says. Owens counters that an automatic response would be transient, lasting for perhaps a few seconds before fading. He says his patient's responses lasted for up to 30 seconds, until he asked her to stop. He believes this demonstrates strong motivation. He does admit, however, that it is impossible to say whether the patient is fully conscious. Although in theory it might be possible to ask simple 'yes/no' questions using the technique, he says: \u201cWe just don't know what she's capable of. We can't get inside her head and see what the quality of her experience is like.\u201d If she is conscious, a pressing question is how many other vegetative patients might be in a similar condition. Here the uncertainty is even greater. A vegetative state can be triggered by a vast range of brain injuries, which vary widely in severity. \u201cFamily members should not think that any patient in a vegetative state is necessarily conscious and can play tennis,\u201d says co-author Steven Laureys of the University of Li\u00e8ge, Belgium.\u201cIt's an illustration of how the evaluation of consciousness, which is a subjective and personal thing, is very tricky, especially with someone who cannot communicate.\u201d The patient studied by Owen's group, for example, seems to have been much less severely injured than the permanently vegetative Terri Schiavo, whose case inflamed the moral debate over whether those who show no signs of recovery should be allowed to die. Schiavo's feeding tube was removed in March 2005 after a legal wrangle. Nevertheless, the research raises questions about whether the definition of a vegetative state should be changed to allow the possibility of using brain imaging to ascertain awareness. Currently, the condition is diagnosed if patients show no external awareness of themselves or their environment, although, in contrast to coma patients, their sleep\u2013wake cycle is preserved. Typically, after a month the patient is judged to be 'persistently vegetative', and the condition is generally pronounced 'permanent' after a year without signs of recovery. The British and US legal systems then allow doctors to question whether the patient's treatment should be continued. The British patient in the latest research seems to have been at the less severe end of the range of injuries, and is now showing signs that she will recover, says Laureys. Since the research was carried out at the end of 2005, she has developed the ability to track her reflection in a mirror \u2014 which suggests she is emerging into a 'minimally conscious state'. Laureys admits it is therefore possible that her brain scans merely heralded the early stage of her recovery, rather than providing real insight into the vegetative state. \u201cWe cannot exclude that she was in transition,\u201d he says. Another possibility is that the contact made during the study itself might have helped trigger the improvement \u2014 a factor that would raise the hope of being able to treat some cases. But that \u201cremains pure speculation\u201d, says Laureys. Either way, the case is likely to serve as a reminder to doctors that the vegetative state of patients should not be taken for granted. In 2003, another patient, Terry Wallis, stunned doctors by making a marked recovery after spending 19 years in a minimally conscious state. Neuroscientists later discovered that the neurons in his brain had been slowly reconnecting over the years, to bypass damaged regions (H. U. Voss  et al .  J. Clin. Invest.   116 , 2005\u20132011; 2005). Laureys believes that many patients may be slowly moving along a continuum from the vegetative condition, through minimal consciousness to full recovery. \u201cAs clinicians, we're obliged to reduce reality to a binary condition,\u201d he says. \u201cWe have to draw a line where there is actually a grey zone.\u201d Neuroscientists have been trying for years to find firm evidence about awareness in vegetative patients. But previous studies using positron emission tomography have proved inconclusive. Four years ago, Laureys reported that although primitive brain centres in such patients were activated in response to a painful electric shock, the frontoparietal network, thought to be required for conscious perception, was not. This suggested that patients were unaware of the pain to which they had responded (S. Laureys  et al .  NeuroImage   17,  732\u2013741; 2002). Studies using fMRI, which is thought to give a more accurate picture of brain activity, have been developed only recently. Owen says he hopes that real-time fMRI, which has become available since his latest study, will allow more sophisticated tests. \n                 See Editorial, page 121 \n               \n                     'Miracle recovery' shows brain's resilience \n                   \n                     Sleeping pills offer wake-up call to vegetative patients \n                   \n                     Right-to-die case highlights brain mysteries \n                   \n                     Brain and behaviour news \n                   \n                     Health and medicine news \n                   \n                     MRC Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit \n                   \n                     Science \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

This is just a few hundred million years after the first stars are thought to have switched on. Other teams have claimed galaxies even farther back in time, although these are awaiting confirmation \u2014 or have turned out to be wrong (see  'The galaxy that wasn't' ). But the latest detection is not in doubt. \u201cMost people would agree that this is the most convincing, most distant object that has been published,\u201d says Richard Ellis of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, who also hunts for distant galaxies. To find the object, Masanori Iye of the National Astronomical Observatory in Tokyo and his colleagues used the 8.2-metre Subaru Telescope in Hawaii to look for the characteristic radiation emitted by hydrogen in hot, star-forming regions. This emission, known as Lyman-\u03b1 radiation, has a wavelength that puts it in the ultraviolet part of the spectrum. But light reaching us from distant galaxies has been stretched, or 'redshifted', by the expansion of the Universe, so Iye's team looked for the line at longer wavelengths \u2014 the larger the redshift, the older the emitting object. They identified a Lyman-\u03b1 emitter with a redshift of 6.96, then confirmed it was a galaxy by studying the spectrum of its light in more detail. The identity of a second emitter remains uncertain. The redshift of the most distant galaxies known has crept up from a neighbourly 1\u20132 in the early 1980s to the latest value obtained by Iye (see graph, below). Each new record has drawn much interest. \u201cThis is one of the few areas in observational astronomy where you can get your name in the  Guinness Book of Records ,\u201d notes Richard McMahon of the University of Cambridge, UK, who used to hold the record himself. But some hope to move on from merely claiming records. \u201cI think the field is changing from being simply record-driven, to finding out whether we can reach times where we can see very different properties in the early Universe,\u201d says Esther Hu, of the University of Hawaii in Honolulu, who championed early efforts to find Lyman-\u03b1 emitters. In this respect, the more interesting aspect of Iye's paper is that the team found fewer galaxies than it expected. This matches a survey by Rychard Bouwens and Garth Illingworth of the University of California, Santa Cruz (see  page 189 ). They analysed data from the Hubble Space Telescope and suggest that the number of detectable galaxies drops off above a redshift of 7. This decline might mean that astronomers are getting close to the point when the first galaxies formed. Earlier galaxies may have been smaller, fainter objects that later merged to form brighter beacons. Such information could be fed into simulations of how hydrogen in the early Universe clumped together (see  page 151 ). \u201cWhat we've done is provide key data that can provide the constraints or inputs to the models,\u201d says Illingworth. That doesn't mean astronomers have given up on going farther back in time. New instruments, including an infrared camera to be installed on the Hubble Space Telescope \u2014 if the space shuttle makes another servicing trip \u2014 and the James Webb Space Telescope, due to fly in 2013, should find a flood of more distant objects. In the meantime, new techniques are pushing back the limits. Ellis, for example, is searching for distant galaxies whose faint light has been amplified by the gravitational fields of closer galactic clusters. He is preparing a paper that claims six candidates around a redshift of 10 \u2014 dating from when the Universe was between 400 million and 500 million years old. Some prefer to investigate closer, brighter galaxies, about which more can be learnt. \u201cUnless you can measure something else in the galaxy, it's not very useful,\u201d says Illingworth. But going for the record does get you attention. A story featuring Ellis's search for the oldest objects made the cover of  Time  magazine's 4 September issue. Illingworth, an old friend and collaborator, jokes: \u201cIt's good for astronomy to have these articles, but I'll kick Richard in the butt sometime for not mentioning the other things we're doing.\u201d \n                     Echoes of Big Bang found in galaxies \n                   \n                     Early Universe insight \n                   \n                     US astronomy: Is the next big thing too big? \n                   \n                     University of California Observatories' guide to the first galaxies \n                   \n                     Wikipedia on controversial claims of a distant galaxy \n                   \n                     Time magazine cover story: \u201cLet there be light\u201d \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

A long-awaited beam of neutrinos has finally made it from Switzerland to a laboratory 730 kilometres away in central Italy. The scientists involved hope the project, first sketched out 25 years ago, will address one of the big unsolved problems in particle physics. But it may yet be upstaged by the next generation of neutrino experiments. The project, which was switched on this week, is a collaboration between the CERN particle-physics lab, near Geneva, and the Gran Sasso National Laboratory, located 1,400 metres underground in the region of Abruzzo and run by Italy's National Institute for Nuclear Physics (INFN). A flux of neutrinos \u2014 fundamental particles that are electrically neutral \u2014 is generated by an accelerator at CERN, and beamed towards the Italian lab. Neutrinos hardly interact with matter, so they travel underground through the rock in a straight line until they hit OPERA, a 1,800-tonne detector comprising emulsion films and lead plates that will stop a handful of them. Neutrinos are known to exist in three types, or 'flavours': muon, tau and electron. Since the late 1960s, researchers studying neutrinos reaching Earth from space have noticed that they seem to change flavour, or 'oscillate' as they travel. That is surprising because when their existence was first postulated in 1930, neutrinos were thought to have no mass; and quantum mechanics says the oscillations observed require some mass, albeit a small amount. If neutrinos do have mass, tweaking today's standard model of the Universe to take account of it could help physicists get closer to a unified theory of fundamental forces. A neutrino with mass could also explain, at least in part, why the visible matter in the Universe forms such a tiny proportion of the total mass it is known to contain. One way to settle the matter is to create neutrinos and fire them at distant detectors. By comparing the beam's composition at source and detector, it is possible to find out whether neutrinos oscillate along the way. The first experiment of this kind was K2K in Japan (see  'A very lengthy business' ). Between 1999 and 2004, it collected evidence that muon neutrinos \u2014 the easiest flavour to study \u2014 were disappearing between the source and final destination. A similar but more powerful experiment, MINOS, started in 2005 between Fermilab in Chicago and Soudan in Minnesota. In less than a year it saw three times as many events as K2K, and confirmed that muon neutrinos were disappearing. OPERA is the third and most ambitious of these experiments: it can detect not just the absence of muon neutrinos, but the appearance of taus. \u201cThe others can only see if some neutrinos are missing and presume they have changed flavour,\u201d says INFN president, Roberto Petronzio. \u201cWe can see for the first time if new neutrinos appear.\u201d Next year, ICARUS, a more sensitive detector based on liquid argon, will join OPERA. Together, it is hoped the two experiments will provide definitive evidence for muon-to-tau oscillation, and determine the tau's mass. Although the oscillation model is now widely accepted, there are still big questions. First, researchers need to rank the three flavours in order of mass. Second, they want to see whether there is a fourth kind of neutrino, which doesn't interact with matter at all. Although this type of neutrino could not be observed directly, combining results from different experiments might reveal its existence. \n               Great reception \n             For the Italian physics community, the arrival of the first neutrinos satisfies a long-held dream. As long ago as the early 1980s, Petronzio recalls, \u201cthe INFN president drew a sketch for Italian senators showing a map of Italy and Switzerland, and a line connecting CERN and Gran Sasso\u201d. All the rooms in Gran Sasso are built so that they point to CERN. Work on the neutrino beam got serious in the late 1990s, but funding problems slowed progress. CERN and the INFN were originally supposed to contribute equally. However, \u201cin 2002, we decided not to have any scientific involvement in the project\u201d, recalls Jos Engelen, CERN's chief scientific officer. CERN now acts only as 'particle provider', a role he says the lab is still happy with. Now it is finally running, OPERA may end up squeezed between old and new generations of neutrino experiments. In a few years, two new projects, NO\u03bdA in the United States and T2K in Japan, are due to start searching for the third flavour, the electron neutrino. \u201cThat is really the missing part of the picture,\u201d says Gary Barker, a physicist at the University of Warwick, UK, who is a member of the T2K group. \u201cOPERA is a valuable experiment, but it will prove directly something MINOS has already shown indirectly.\u201d Engelen says he is confident that the Italian experiment will provide precious results, but admits that CERN's long-term commitment is not yet confirmed. \u201cCERN will provide the beam for the next five years, then a new agreement will be made depending on the results, both from OPERA and from the other experiments,\u201d he says. \u201cNeutrino physics might not be among our priorities in the future.\u201d \n                     Neutrino ripples spotted in space \n                   \n                     The state of the Universe \n                   \n                     CERN: The show goes on \n                   \n                     Antineutrinos caught in vanishing act \n                   \n                     Dark side of the universe In Focus \n                   \n                     Physical sciences news channel \n                   \n                     CNGS experiment \n                   \n                     MINOS experiment \n                   \n                     K2K experiment \n                   \n                     Nova experiment \n                   \n                     T2K experiment \n                   \n                     VLBN experiment \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

You're sitting on a university's ethics panel. A proposed experiment into the neurobiology of social behaviour comes up for approval. Subjects' brains will be scanned while they perform a series of tasks. Some of the participants have a history of disturbed social behaviour; one task involves viewing violent images. On completion, participants are simply asked to leave the laboratory. Would you give the experiment a green light? If you're not sure, don't worry: neither are many real ethical review boards. When Canadian researchers asked their country's boards to rule on the protocol described above, they found a startling lack of conformity. All the boards that responded seemed to use similar ethical norms when judging the project, but thirty rejected it, ten approved it with qualifications, and three waved it through unconditionally (J. de Champlain and J. Patenaude  J. Med. Ethics   32,  530\u2013534; 2006). \u201cEveryone knows institutional review boards make very different decisions,\u201d says Joan Sieber, a psychologist at California State University, East Bay, who helps to train board members.

Two boards also noted that the rationale was not made clear in the consent forms. Sieber says review boards need to be more rigorous in their risk assessments and decisions, and says they should call in outside experts where necessary.

An outbreak of virulent and very drug-resistant tuberculosis in South Africans with HIV is horrifying health professionals and prompting the usually slow-and-steady field of tuberculosis medicine into emergency action. \u201cThis is the nightmare scenario of HIV-fuelled drug resistance,\u201d says Paul Nunn of the World Health Organization's (WHO's) Stop TB Partnership. The new strain, called extreme drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR TB), is virtually untreatable. Neither the standard drugs nor at least three of the six classes of more toxic and less-effective backup drugs are effective. So far all those infected in the South African outbreak have HIV. Drug resistance is energetically costly for bacteria to maintain, and it may be that a strain resistant to so many drugs is not virulent enough to make healthy people seriously ill. But those with immune systems weakened by HIV are more susceptible to bacterial infections, and in populations with high concentrations of HIV, patients infected with XDR TB will pass it on to those around them. Delegates to an emergency conference in Johannesburg heard last week that more than 120 patients in 28 hospitals in rural Kwazulu Natal province, South Africa, had contracted this severe form of tuberculosis. Nearly all of those known to be infected are now dead, but many others may be carrying the bacteria. \u201cThere is no systematic survey, so this is just the tip of the iceberg,\u201d says Nunn. A survey released in March showed that XDR TB is a global phenomenon, with relatively more cases occurring in Eastern Europe and Western Asia. But until now, only isolated cases of XDR TB have been seen. The Kwazulu situation is the first outbreak of XDR TB. It was first reported at last month's International AIDS conference in Toronto, Canada, but the latest figures, from a wider area, give a clearer picture of the scope of the outbreak. The fear is that the disease could spread north where HIV levels are also high, if it hasn't already. Scientists at last week's emergency conference, organized by the South African Medical Research Council, the WHO and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, struggled to gear up efforts fast enough to tackle the outbreak. \u201cThe TB community is used to doing things slowly and steadily, and thoroughly and well, not at all in outbreak mode such as with SARS and avian flu, and I think that is required,\u201d says Nunn. But he says it is hard to galvanize efforts in Kwazulu because of the problems that are typical across the developing world \u2014 including overcrowded hospitals, unfinished treatment courses, lack of well-equipped labs, widespread HIV infection and grinding poverty. \u201cThere is a certain amount of fatigue.\u201d Officials at the nonprofit Global Alliance for TB Drug Development in New York say that they have been approached to see if any of the drugs they are researching could be deployed on a 'compassionate use' emergency basis. Unfortunately, according to alliance president Maria Freire: \u201cThe drugs we have are too early for that.\u201d The alliance estimates that the first drugs in an entirely new class will not be ready for regular use until 2012. \n                     Curbing AIDS epidemic means treating TB \n                   \n                     New vaccines, drugs revitalize tuberculosis research \n                   \n                     Vaccine helps to banish tuberculosis \n                   \n                     Compound J tackles tuberculosis \n                   \n                     Nature Medicine focus on tuberculosis \n                   \n                     CDC article of emergence of resistance \n                   \n                     XVI International AIDS Conference on TB/HIV coinfection \n                   \n                     Stop TB Partnership \n                   \n                     Global Alliance for TB Drug Development \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Religion is religion, science is science, and good fences make good neighbours. That seems likely to be the thrust of an expected clarification by the Roman Catholic Church of its position on biological evolution, according to a prominent biologist who spoke at a retreat on the topic held last weekend by Pope Benedict XVI. This outcome would be a blow to supporters of intelligent design who had hoped that factions in the Vatican sympathetic to their ideas might prevail in an internal feud over evolution that has opened since the death of Pope John Paul II in April last year. That could have given a global axis to what has been largely a US cultural phenomenon. John Paul II perhaps did more than any pontiff to reconcile faith and science, declaring in 1980 that there was no contradiction between the two. He subsequently described darwinian evolution as more than a hypothesis, and in 1992 officially rehabilitated Galileo Galilei, admitting the Church's fault. Benedict XVI, however, has long been more ambiguous on the topic. In his first mass as Pope, he stated that \u201cwe are not some casual and meaningless product of evolution\u201d. Last year, the prominent Cardinal Christoph Sch\u00f6nborn wrote an article in  The New York Times  expressing doubts about darwinism. He also seemed to advocate intelligent design, a movement whose advocates seek to give creationism scientific credibility by arguing that the complexity of science can be explained only by divine intervention in the process of evolution. Although Sch\u00f6nborn has since back-pedalled on the way his ideas were expressed in the article, the piece fuelled rumours that Rome, which currently endorses darwinian evolution and rejects any literal interpretation of biblical creation, might instead endorse intelligent design. Speculation increased last month when Sch\u00f6nborn announced that creation and evolution would be the topic of the Pope's annual retreat, to be held in Castel Gandolfo near Rome. As a former cardinal and German theology professor, Joseph Ratzinger has long held this informal gathering, where he discusses a hot topic with his past students. But the retreat has taken on new significance since Ratzinger became Pope. Bruce Chapman, president of the Discovery Institute in Seattle, Washington, which represents the intelligent-design movement, welcomed the choice of topic in a press release published on the institute's website last week. In it he wrote: \u201cWhat's good about all this is that they're taking up the issue seriously...it will be conducted at a very high level and I think it should give cheer to people who are critics of Darwinism.\u201d Sch\u00f6nborn was one of four invited speakers at the meeting, which also included Robert Spaemann, a conservative German philosopher, and Paul Erbrich, a Jesuit priest who questions the random nature of evolution. The fourth speaker, the only working scientist present, was Peter Schuster, a molecular biologist and president of the Austrian Academy of Sciences. In a break with tradition, the proceedings of the meeting will be published later this year, says Schuster, with a preface written by the Pope. The message will be to promote dialogue between faith and reason, Schuster says. Given the power struggles within the Church, however, the precise outcome of the overall debate is impossible to predict, he says: \u201cWe have to wait.\u201d But discussions at the meeting suggest that the Church will probably affirm a form of theistic evolution, which posits the general principle that biological evolution is valid, although set in motion by God. At the same time, it seems likely to reject the fundamental intelligent-design principle that God was a watchmaker, intervening in the details. \u201cIntelligent design as an intervention of God during evolution will not be an outcome,\u201d predicts Schuster. \u201cI got the impression that there was general agreement that evolutionary biology is a undeniable science and not a hypothesis.\u201d The Pope in particular \u201cimmediately accepted that theology is not going to interfere with science\u201d, Schuster adds. \u201cHe is not a scientist, but I was surprised by the sharpness of his intellect. He wanted to be informed; he was very interested in science.\u201d But although there is likely to be agreement that the Church should not attempt to question the basic theory of evolution, those at the meeting were also adamant that science should not stray into theology. Schuster says there was a wide desire to address the Church's concern that darwinism is being extrapolated as a wider metaphysical stance. This argues that we are random products of evolution, and that there is therefore no need for God. \u201cI agree that, as in science, everyone should stay within their realms of competence,\u201d says Schuster. \n                     Intelligent design verdict set to sway other cases \n                   \n                     Intelligent design: Who has designs on your students' minds? \n                   \n                     Pope urged to reflect on condom use \n                   \n                     Pope praised for partial conciliation of science and religion \n                   \n                     Religion and science: Studies of faith \n                   \n                     Pontifical Academy on Life \n                   \n                     Peter Schuster homepage \n                   \n                     Connotea resources \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},
{"file_id": "443008b", "url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/443008b", "year": 2006, "authors": [{"name": "Ehsan Masood"}], "parsed_as_year": "2006_or_before", "body": "Direct sightings of the Moon will no longer define US festivals. The Muslim community in the United States has taken a small but significant step towards resolving one of the oldest disputes between Islam and science \u2014 the creation of a unified lunar calendar. Islam, in common with Judaism, uses lunar dates worked out in accordance with the phases of the Moon. But despite major advances in lunar astronomy over the past few centuries, Muslims have never agreed a single lunar calendar. This may finally be about to change. At a meeting last month, the Fiqh Council of North America, a body of American Islamic religious scholars, agreed that religious festivals in the United States such as Eid, the end of the fasting month of Ramadan, will now be fixed according to a predetermined calendar. In a statement on 28 August, Muzammil Siddiqi, chairman of the Fiqh Council, said: \u201cMuslims will be able to plan their activities in advance, take time off from work or school. It will reduce a lot of chaos, hardship and confusion.\u201d The move was welcomed in Britain by Zafar Iqbal who chairs the Islamic Calendar Committee of the Muslim Council of Britain, a coalition of some 400 mosques and community groups. Iqbal believes that the US decision will strengthen calls for Britain's estimated 1.6 million Muslims to adopt a unified calendar. \u201cThis is a very courageous decision,\u201d he says. The US decision has its critics among both scientists and theologians, including members of the Fiqh Council itself. One member says he doesn't think the move will have universal appeal \u2014 especially among those who believe that it is a religious requirement for the beginning of each lunar month to be confirmed by a naked-eye sighting of the new Moon. This need to see the new Moon dates from the time of the Prophet Mohammed in the seventh century. And there is a reluctance to switch from what people believe Mohammed required, regardless of whether a scientific approach might be more convenient \u2014 in fact doing so is seen by many Islamic scholars as coming close to committing a sin. Usama Hasan, a lecturer in computer science at Middlesex University, UK, is an Islamic scholar and has collaborated with the Royal Observatory in London. He says that the council should have used a more accurate method to compile the calendar. The council opted for a method based on computing the position of the Moon relative to Earth and the Sun. But Hasan says that the technology now exists to predict whether the Moon will be visible in a certain place at a certain time, which comes closer to the requirements of Islamic tradition. \u201cSeeing the Moon with the naked eye is a means to an end; it should not be seen as an end in itself,\u201d he says. But the naked eye remains the method of choice throughout the Islamic world, and is one of the main reasons a unified calendar has so far proved elusive. According to this tradition, a new lunar month begins the morning after a sighting of the thin crescent Moon \u2014 some 24 hours after the birth of a new Moon. That's difficult for countries in the Northern Hemisphere, because thick clouds often hide the crescent Moon. And in countries at higher latitudes, such as in Scandinavia, the crescent is invisible to the naked eye. When this happens, mosques in northern Europe and North America tend to follow decisions in other countries. Saudi Arabia and Pakistan are favourites, but even they often celebrate Islamic festivals on different days. Hasan is confident that the US decision will prompt a rethink in Saudi Arabia, where Moon-sighting causes frequent controversy. Saudi Arabia does have an Islamic calendar based on lunar tables, known as the  Umm al-Qura  calendar. This was developed by the King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology, the country's science ministry, and is used for all non-religious purposes. But human sightings are still used to determine dates for religious festivals. Moreover, anyone can claim to have seen the Moon \u2014 the authorities are duty-bound to listen, and sometimes accept news of a sighting even if this does not agree with the dates in the lunar calendar. This happened last year, when the Saudi government decided, with just ten days to go, to revise the date for the annual Hajj pilgrimage because of a claimed Moon sighting \u2014 even though astronomical calculations showed such a sighting to be impossible. The sudden change led to chaos in the organization of the three-day event, which attracts 2 million people from more than 150 countries. Siddiqi, too, is hopeful that the use of lunar calendars will catch on, if only to rule out erroneous sightings. \n                     Women at work \n                   \n                     Islamic science: Rebuilding the past \n                   \n                     Religion and science: Studies of faith \n                   \n                     Religion and science in focus \n                   \n                     Islamic society of North America \n                   \n                     Islamic calendar on Wikipedia \n                   \n                     Moonwatch project \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Paris Global politics has soured the run-up to this week's TNT2006 Trends in Nanotechnology conference in France. Organizers initially banned some 15 Iranian researchers from attending, citing political concerns over Iran's nuclear programme. The decision has since been revoked and two Iranians will now attend the conference on 4\u20138 September in Grenoble. The remainder have withdrawn, according to the organizers, because of problems such as visa delays. But the incident has raised concerns that the current political situation, in which Iran faces international isolation over its refusal to stop its uranium enrichment programme, may cause scientists from the country to be ostracized. Those involved in the conference have denied any discrimination against Iranian scientists, and say the incident is the result of a series of misunderstandings about the security-clearance rules. The congress centre in which the conference is being held is inside Minatec, a sprawling research and industrial complex that belongs to the French Atomic Energy Commission (CEA). When Antonio Correia, president of conference organizers the PHANTOMS Foundation in Madrid, began receiving submissions from Iran he contacted Didier Molko, CEA director of Minatec, to check whether this raised any security concerns. Molko told him that \u201cCEA rules say that Iranian people can't go in\u201d. As a result, Correia e-mailed the Iranian applicants on 9 June, apologizing that \u201cwe must withdraw your contribution and participation\u201d, a move he says met an angry response. \u201cI understand that people were angry,\u201c says Correia. \u201cScience should have nothing to do with politics.\u201d Molko now says his initial decision was a personal mistake, and not CEA policy. He was being cautious because of the political situation, he says, but after checking with his superiors in Paris, he revoked his earlier decision. \u201cIt was a delay of a week or two at most.\u201d Pascal Newton, a spokesman for CEA headquarters in Paris, says that the commission's security services check out all visitors to CEA buildings on a case-by-case basis. \u201cWe get a simple, yes/no; we never know why.\u201d Particular nationalities aren't officially banned, he says, although he adds: \u201cIn the current political context, I can imagine Iran might be more sensitive.\u201d The United Nations Security Council set a deadline of last week for Iran to suspend uranium enrichment activities, which it suspects are part of a programme to develop nuclear weapons. Iran ignored the deadline and, failing last-ditch negotiations this week, the council is set to impose economic sanctions on the country. International isolation in similar situations has in the past spared scientific cooperation. Indeed, during the cold war, contact between scientists was one of the few channels open between East and West. But Reza Mansouri, a well-known Iranian physicist based at the Sharif University of Technology in Tehran, complains that his country's scientists are already falling victim to discrimination, such as visa delays. He also worries about what he sees as widespread ostracization by fellow scientists, and he deplores the incident in France. But Mansouri says he believes it is a temporary problem induced by the tense international climate. \u201cIn the long term, the best scientists will continue to collaborate with our scientists, bringing more rationality and understanding into the dialogue, and ultimately more peaceful attitudes.\u201d \n                     Revival in Iran \n                   \n                     Iran takes steps to go nuclear \n                   \n                     Atomic agency launches bid to bank nuclear fuel \n                   \n                     Iran's long march \n                   \n                     Iranian neuroscience: The brains trust of Tehran \n                   \n                     Minatec \n                   \n                     TNT2006 Trends in Nanotechnology \n                   \n                     French Atomic Energy Commission (CEA) \n                   \n                     Reza Mansouri homepage \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Today, Motrunich is back in America. His visa was renewed after a six-month delay, but exactly what sparked the background check is still a mystery. Five years after the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001, foreign scientists are reporting fewer problems in trying to enter the United States. Waiting times are down and, according to a survey by the Washington-based Council of Graduate Schools, admissions in the sciences are rebounding. Yet anger and unease continue to cloud many researchers' views of America. \u201cIt's very hard to overcome the perception that's developed over the past couple of years,\u201d says Debra Stewart, the council's president. US immigration changed suddenly and dramatically after the 2001 attacks. Congress passed legislation requiring face-to-face interviews with every visa applicant, leading to lengthy delays \u2014 even in European countries where the visa process was traditionally smooth. Scientists had longer waits than most because their fields of study often appeared on the government's Technology Alert List. Many researchers' applications were sent to Washington for background checks that could take months, according to Barry Toiv, director of public affairs for the Association of American Universities, a Washington-based group that represents university interests. \u201cWe went through a very difficult period following 11 September,\u201d he says. The situation has improved greatly since then, according to Tony Edson, deputy assistant secretary of state for visa services at the US Department of State. Embassies and consulates have increased staffing, and new computer systems have been installed that allow applications to pass electronically between embassies and Washington agencies. To reduce the number of security checks, consular officers are receiving some additional training in handling scientific cases, and they are being encouraged to consult science attach\u00e9s when appropriate. \u201cWe've added extra people, we're investing in infrastructure,\u201d Edson says. \u201cThat has improved the situation.\u201d \n               Waiting game \n             The average wait still varies widely from country to country, but state-department statistics on the length of the Washington-based security checks that many scientists encounter show dramatic improvement. The average wait has dropped from 2.5 months in 2003 to two weeks by last December. But those statistics do not reflect the trouble individual scientists can have when entering the United States (see ' The cold shoulder '). When Goverdhan Mehta, a chemist and former director of the Indian Institute of Science in Bangalore, applied for a visa to become a visiting professor at the University of Florida at Gainesville in February, embassy officials delayed his application and badgered him about how his research might relate to chemical weapons (see  Nature   439 , 901; 2006 10.1038/439901a ). Mehta was so incensed that he declined the visa when it was eventually offered to him. The University of Florida has renewed its invitation, but Mehta remains ambivalent. \u201cCertainly I am not going to subject myself to the same process,\u201d he says. Stewart says that such stories are still damaging the United States' image in the international scientific community. \u201cEvery time there is a high-profile case like that it's five steps backwards,\u201d she says. To try to improve the views of foreign students and scholars, many US universities are now reaching out to the international community, according to Marlene Johnson, executive director of the Association for International Educators. International student offices have boosted staffing and many universities have opened recruiting offices in countries such as China. \u201cI don't know of a single major research university that was recruiting before 9/11,\u201d Johnson says. The increase in recruitment and drop in waiting times seems to have had a positive effect (see graph). According to a survey by the Council of Graduate Schools, released last month, graduate admissions in the 2005\u201306 school year were up sharply. Places offered to students from India and China, the largest suppliers of science and engineering students, rose 28% and 20%, respectively. That may have contributed to a less impressive, but still positive, 1% rise in admissions to PhD programmes in the life sciences and a 5% rise in physical sciences. Final enrolment numbers out later this year are expected also to show a positive trend, says Stewart. \u201cWe're seeing a turnaround.\u201d Not reflected in the numbers are those, such as Mehta, who have given up on coming to the United States. \u201cThe visa trouble was definitely one reason why I went back to Germany,\u201d says Stefan Gilb, a chemistry professor at the Technical University of Munich, whose visa renewal was delayed during his time at the University of California, Berkeley. And Reza Mansouri, an Iranian physicist, was pulled out of line by security in May at a US consulate in Montreal, Canada. After several hours of delays he decided to go home rather than be hassled further. \u201cI told them 'I don't need a US visa. Bye-bye',\u201d he says. Mansouri did eventually get his visa, however, and is due to arrive in San Francisco this week. Most education experts suspect that, despite delays, scientists and graduate students will ultimately come back to the United States. \u201cWe have 4,000 institutions and the capacity to absorb a whole lot of international students,\u201d says Peggy Blumenthal, a vice-president at the Institute of International Education, a group based in New York that tracks the flow of foreign students and scholars. Well-stocked labs with strong funding opportunities mean that \u201cparticularly in fields such as science and engineering, we will continue to attract the best and the brightest\u201d, she adds. But America's hegemony is not ensured. In Australia, overseas enrolment has more than doubled from 2000 to 2004, and, according to a recent government report, today roughly a quarter of its one million undergraduate and graduate students come from outside the country. Significant rises have been reported in Europe, and China and India are attempting to expand their domestic higher-education sectors, especially in science and engineering. These trends were already apparent in the late 1990s, and in a way, says Stewart, the restrictions since 2001 may have helped the United States come to terms with the increasingly competitive global market. \u201cWe still have the best doctoral programmes in the world,\u201d she says. \u201cBut it's not our God-given right.\u201d For his part, Motrunich has decided to stay, at least for now. He's leaving the University of California, Santa Barbara, to begin a new job at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena this autumn. Whatever his problems with the US immigration system, his colleagues have never made him feel unwelcome, he says. \u201cIn the scientific community, the fact that one is from a foreign country plays no role.\u201d See Editorial,  \n                     page 2 \n                   . \n                     Frosty US visa policy leaves Indian science cold \n                   \n                     As one door closes... \n                   \n                     US visas in focus \n                   \n                     CGS Survey \n                   \n                     US Department of State visa page \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

The lunar orbiter SMART-1 is due to crash-land on the Moon on 2 or 3 September: dates chosen to help ground telescopes spy on the impact. The craft will smack into the Lake of Excellence, an area with interesting mineralogy, at a time when this falls just on the dark side of the Moon's border between day and night. That should give both enough contrast and background lighting to see the smash, when the dust it kicks up is highlighted by sunlight and reflected earthshine. The elliptical descent orbit has been chosen to have the craft hit ground at 05:41 GMT, which will be best for viewing with big telescopes in South America and Northwest America, Hawaii and Australia. But there's a chance it could hit a hill on the passes before that. It could crash down at 00:37 GMT, giving the Canary Islands and South America the best view, or even at 19:33 GMT the previous day, giving Continental Europe and Africa the advantage. See the  European Space Agency's website  for details on how to view it.  With an impact speed of 2 kilometres per second, SMART-1 should create a crater 5-10 metres in diameter and 1 metre deep: about the same as that made by a 2-kilogram meteorite. Powerful telescopes on Earth should see a faint flash from the strike itself, followed by a 5-kilometre-wide cloud of dust thrown up by the impact. Observatories around the globe have volunteered to watch the blast, to help work out the characteristics of the minerals beneath the surface. But if the dust cloud is kicked up more than 20 kilometres into the sunshine, then amateurs should also have the fun of spying the sunlit cloud with binoculars and small telescopes.

Ocean measurements suggest the world's seas have cooled substantially during some of the warmest years in recent history. If real, the dip is likely to reflect a short-term fluctuation in an ocean that is warming overall, say climate scientists. The years 2003 and 2005 saw the highest global average surface temperatures in more than a century. An upcoming paper in  Geophysical Research Letters  reports that during this period, the upper 750 metres of the oceans lost around one-fifth of the heat accumulated over the past 50 years. But don't read too much into that, oceanographers warn. \u201cCooling on a short-term scale doesn't challenge the long-term warming trend,\u201d says Sydney Levitus, director of the World Data Center for Oceanography in Silver Spring, Maryland. \u201cWhat it does tell us is that we still don't sufficiently understand how the global climate system works.\u201d Oceans cover two-thirds of Earth's surface and have far more heat-storing capacity than air or land. Overall, they have warmed in recent decades. Between 1955 and 1998, for example, all of the world's oceans, down to a depth of 3,000 metres, warmed by 0.037 \u00b0C (S. Levitus, J. Antonov and T. Boyer  Geophys. Res. Lett.   32,  L02604; 2005). But that warming has not proceeded steadily. The trend has reversed for a few years at least once during the past half century. In fact, a drop in temperature that occurred between 1980 and 1983 was almost twice as pronounced as the current cooling. But only for this latest cooling episode have oceanographers obtained good enough global data to provide a convincing argument that the effect is real. The report relies in part on data gathered by ARGO, a global array of 2,500 floats. The ARGO floats descend to various depths to probe ocean temperature and salinity, and surface occasionally to transmit their data via satellites. When ARGO data were removed from the analysis, the cooling was significantly less pronounced, and the error bars became larger, say the authors of the report, led by John Lyman of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in Seattle, Washington. Some researchers suspect that ARGO has provided the ability to detect short-term temperature fluctuations. \u201cWe may be seeing different things just because we are looking harder,\u201d says Brian King, a physical oceanographer at the Southampton Oceanography Centre, UK. Better observation systems are showing the oceans are more changeable than some people thought, says Gavin Schmidt, a climate modeller at the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York City. A short-term cooling blip can't say much about the climate system in general. But the latest study suggests, he says, that coupled ocean\u2013climate models fail to adequately capture intermittent fluctuations in ocean temperature. In theory, the recent cooling should have led to a 2-millimetre drop in sea level due to the thermal contraction of water, which becomes denser at lower temperatures. But satellites have measured a steady rise in sea level between 1993 and 2005 \u2014 years covered by the study. For the observations to be reconciled, melting ice sheets in Antarctica and Greenland must be contributing far more to sea-level rise than previously suspected, says Schmidt. Of course, much of the observed ocean-temperature decrease could be an artefact of sampling, says Tim Barnett, a climate researcher at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in San Diego, California. For example, if warmer water has simply redistributed to areas where fewer ARGO floats exist, the net cooling could be smaller than the data suggest. But assuming the trend is real, what caused the cooling and where did the heat go? Aerosols, volcanic activity and small changes in ocean circulations and convection processes may all play a role, says King. But the simplest explanation is that less sunlight has reached the ocean surface as cloud coverage has increased. Global cloud coverage has increased by 1\u20132% since 1999 according to data from the International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project, presumably because of global warming and increased evaporation. Other factors \u2014 such as cloud albedo (the extent to which cloud reflects solar radiation) or cloud-top temperature \u2014 might have changed in the same period, says William Rossow, a cloud expert at the Goddard Institute. \u201cIt is completely insufficient to look for a simple explanation of a short-term temperature change,\u201d he says, \u201cas the climate system is much more complex.\u201d The heat itself could be hidden at greater depths in the ocean, or \u2014 more likely, says Schmidt \u2014 it may have escaped into the atmosphere and out into space. Yet a corresponding change in Earth's radiation budget has not been observed. \u201cThe system's internal variability might well be larger than we thought,\u201d says Levitus. \u201cThis is exciting news, but food for global-warming sceptics it is not.\u201d \n                     No sign of increased snowfall in Antarctica \n                   \n                     Glacial pace picks up \n                   \n                     Climate change: A sea change \n                   \n                     Aerosols cool more than expected \n                   \n                     Atmospheric science: Inside information \n                   \n                     Climate Change In Focus \n                   \n                     Geophysical Research Letters \n                   \n                     ARGO programme \n                   \n                     International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project \n                   \n                     RealClimate \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

The answer, researchers are finding, could be that HIV triggers a natural mechanism that impairs the main cells responsible for fighting the virus. As a result, these cells, called killer T cells, eventually become exhausted and give up their fight. Now, research indicates that giving these tired cells a boost may be simple, and clinical trials using this strategy could start as early as next year. \u201cThis is really a very important phenomenon, and it explains a lot of things,\u201d says Rafick-Pierre S\u00e9kaly of the University of Montreal in Quebec, senior author of one of two papers published on 20 August. \u201cWe would like to be able to push this into patients and show whether this has an effect.\u201d \n               Clue in mice \n             The story began last December, when Rafi Ahmed of Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia, reported work on mice infected with a chronic viral infection 1 . His group studied the T cells these mice made to target the long-term infection. The researchers found that the cells expressed much higher levels of a protein called PD-1 than mice infected with a short-term infection. This was intriguing, because scientists already knew that PD-1 can act as a brake on T cells that express it, forcing them to shut down their fight against infections. Even more tantalizing was Ahmed's finding that he could release the PD-1 brake by injecting the mice with a molecule to block PD-1's interaction with another protein, called PD-1 ligand. That protein triggers the PD-1 molecule to shut off T cells. Stopping the deadly interaction between PD-1 and PD-1 ligand seems to release the restraint on T cells, Ahmed reported. Researchers then raced to examine PD-1 in people. Teams included one led by S\u00e9kaly, now reporting results in  Nature Medicine 2 , and another led by Bruce Walker of Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, who reports results in  Nature 3 . Both teams found that, in human patients, the T cells that should be fighting off HIV express very high levels of PD-1. Both papers also show that levels of PD-1 expression correlate with the amount of HIV a patient has in his or her body, indicating that the protein has something to do with how well the patient controls the virus. And both papers report that interfering with the partnership between PD-1 and PD-1 ligand can rejuvenate the cells' fight against the virus. \u201cExhaustion has been a proposed mechanism of T-cell failure in HIV disease for a long time,\u201d says Michael Lederman, an immunologist at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio, who was not involved in the work. \u201cWhat seems nice about this piece is that it explains some observations that have been made for some time, and it may apply to other infections. And there's an ability to intervene.\u201d \n               Future trials \n             At least one company is already looking at ways to use the finding. Medarex, based in Princeton, New Jersey, is testing a protein that interferes with the PD-1/PD-1 ligand partnership. The company is interested in it as an anticancer agent at the moment, but is also talking to HIV researchers about potential clinical trials. The finding could also help illuminate other chronic viral diseases, such as hepatitis C. And it could help scientists unravel another interesting story: how certain people infected with HIV can control their infections naturally, without drugs, and almost never get sick with AIDS. On 16 August, Walker and S\u00e9kaly announced that they are beginning the first large-scale study on the genetic make-up of these people, known as '\u00e9lite controllers'. S\u00e9kaly adds that PD-1 could shed light on the subject. So far, he has studied 12 \u00e9lite controllers, and all have normal levels of PD-1 expression \u2014 much lower than those found in most HIV patients. Still, other scientists caution that the PD-1 story cannot explain everything. PD-1 is found on many cells, not just those that target HIV. So interfering with it may have unpredictable consequences, says Rick Koup, an immunologist at the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID). Koup is publishing a paper on the PD-1/PD-1 ligand interaction in HIV patients on 5 September, in the  Journal of Experimental Medicine . His findings indicate that blocking PD-1's interaction with PD-1 ligand may simply prevent T cells from dying, rather than rejuvenating them. Anthony Fauci, director of the NIAID, agrees that further investigation is needed to follow up the PD-1 findings. \u201cThis work is elegant and very carefully done, and from a scientific standpoint it's solid,\u201d he says. \u201cBut we've got to be careful we don't make the majestic leap to say: now we've solved the issue of unresponsiveness in people infected with HIV. It may turn out to be that way, but we've got to be cautious.\u201d \n                     News Feature: One for the money \n                   \n                     Bad news for HIV-vaccines? \n                   \n                     AIDS blog 2006 \n                   \n                     AIDS Special 2004 \n                   \n                     HIV Elite Controllers study \n                   \n                     NIAID FAQ on HIV and AIDS \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

A single cell can be teased from a human embryo and used to produce stem cells while leaving the embryo intact. The process, published online in  Nature  this week, could enable stem-cell lines to be generated without the controversial destruction of human embryos \u2014 but some ethical objections remain. Embryonic stem cells, prized for their ability to make other tissue types, are typically extracted from an embryo that has developed into a hollow ball called a blastocyst. The process pulls the embryo apart and destroys it. This week's paper shows that stem-cell lines can be grown from less developed embryos \u2014 balls of eight to ten cells \u2014 and the process could leave them unscarred (I. Klimanskaya  et al .  Nature  doi:10.1038/nature05142; 2006 ). The technique is similar to that used for preimplantation genetic diagnosis, an option during  in vitro  fertilization (IVF) in which a single cell is extracted from an embryo and tested for genetic disorders. Last year, a team led by Robert Lanza of Advanced Cell Technology in Worcester, Massachusetts, showed that single cells extracted from mouse embryos in this way could be grown into stem-cell lines (Y. Chung  et al .  Nature   439 , 216\u2013219; 2006). Since then the team has taken cells from 16 spare IVF human embryos, and put them into culture. From a total of 91 cells, the researchers grew two embryonic stem-cell lines that have survived for eight months so far and are able to form different types of tissue. In the experiment, the embryos were dismantled cell by cell; but other embryos should survive the extraction of a single cell, just as they do in preimplantation genetic diagnosis. Lanza says that the researchers should be able to achieve a higher success rate for cell lines by adjusting the cell culture conditions. Several other groups have been trying similar approaches, but with no reported success so far. \u201cIt shows it's possible to make any number of lines in future without harming embryos or impairing their development,\u201d says bioethicist Ronald Green, head of Dartmouth College Ethics Institute in Hanover, New Hampshire, and an ethics adviser to Lanza's company. \u201cI think it's a way out of the moral impasse in the United States.\u201d President George W. Bush has limited federally funded research on human embryonic stem cells to lines derived before August 2001, on the grounds that he is opposed to destroying embryos to create more lines. Still, the technique is unlikely to answer all ethical concerns (see  Nature   437 , 1076\u20131077; 2005 doi:10.1038/4371072b ). There are fears that removing a cell from an embryo will lower its chances of implantation in the womb, or alter its development and cause later health problems for the resulting child. Lanza answers this by saying that the risks of the procedure are minimal and that it would only be performed on embryos that are to undergo preimplantation genetic diagnosis anyway. Others object that the removed cell itself may have the potential to develop into an entire new embryo, and that this is being destroyed. The method joins a raft of other techniques that have been proposed for deriving ethically sound human embryonic stem cells, such as using embryos that have been genetically altered so that they cannot develop into babies. \u201cNone of those methods was likely to satisfy all the critics, and I don't think this one will either,\u201d says Tom Murray, president of the Hastings Center, a bioethics research institute in Garrison, New York. \n                     A long week in stem-cell politics... \n                   \n                     Human eggs supply 'ethical' stem cells \n                   \n                     Biologists forced to reassess embryo test \n                   \n                     Rebooted cells tackle ethical concerns \n                   \n                     'Ethical' routes to stem cells highlight political divide \n                   \n                     Altered embryos offered as solution to stem-cell rift \n                   \n                     Stem cells in focus \n                   \n                     Stem cells insight \n                   \n                     Stem cells podcast \n                   \n                     Advanced Cell Technology \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

On 3 July, an asteroid zipped past Earth at a distance of some 400,000 kilometres \u2014 slightly farther away than the Moon. In theory, something that close ought to be easy to study. But astronomers have struggled to map the size and shape of the space rock \u2014 and now say they know why they found it so difficult. The rock, dubbed 2004 XP14, is one of more than 800 'near-Earth asteroids' that have been identified in orbits that come perilously close to our planet. This particular rock is unlikely to hit us, but astronomers hoped their observations would help establish how diverse such asteroids are and so better quantify the threat they pose. But the data obtained by the team proved surprisingly hard to analyse. \u201cThe asteroid rotates slowly, so its appearance in the images, due to rotation, hardly changed at all,\u201d says Lance Benner, an astronomer at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, who led the effort to image the asteroid. That's unusual. \u201cMost near-Earth asteroids are very fast rotators,\u201d says Vishnu Reddy, a graduate student at the University of North Dakota who also observed the object. Benner and his colleagues imaged 2004 XP14 using a 70-metre radio antenna at the Goldstone Complex in California. At 260 metres across, the asteroid was a lot smaller than earlier predictions of up to 880 metres. This, together with its rotation rate of roughly one turn every 500 hours, meant that the images the team received barely changed during recording sessions of up to 2 hours. As a result, the researchers could not build the detailed picture of the rock that they wanted. Earth may be safe from 2004 XP14, but there are plenty more asteroids out there that might collide with us. Having identified three-quarters of the candidates 1 kilometre or more in diameter, NASA plans to widen its search to include objects as small as 150 metres across. And in July, the International Astronomical Union formed a committee to keep it up to date about asteroids that may pose a serious threat to our planet. \n                     Asteroid lander misses its mark \n                   \n                     Spacecraft on course to score a first with asteroid samples \n                   \n                     Earth's asteroid risk reduced \n                   \n                     Asteroids pile up \n                   \n                     Rock garden on Eros \n                   \n                     Asteroids close to the Earth? \n                   \n                     The calamity of family break-up \n                   \n                     NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory \n                   \n                     Comet and asteroid impact hazards \n                   \n                     Ostro's asteroid radar page \n                   \n                     UK NEO Information Centre \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

The world's first fully superconducting tokamak is soon to produce a discharge of ionized gas or plasma. If all goes as planned, China's Experimental Advanced Superconducting Tokamak (EAST) project will make its first plasma in the next few weeks. EAST uses superconducting coils to create a magnetic field that confines plasma inside a doughnut-shaped vessel known as a tokamak. The behaviour of the plasma should shed light on the potential of nuclear fusion as an energy source. Conventional experimental fusion machines use copper coils, or a combination of copper and superconducting coils, to trap the hot plasma. But copper coils heat up and need to be cooled down regularly, thus limiting operating time. EAST has only superconducting coils so it can be operated continuously. The US$25-million machine sets the stage for the multibillion-dollar ITER fusion experiment that is to be built in France; ITER, due to start operations in 2016, is similarly designed to be all-superconducting. \u201cWe'll need new energy resources for a long-term period, and fusion will be one of them,\u201d says Peide Weng, deputy manager and chief engineer of the EAST project at the Institute of Plasma Physics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. \u201cFor commercial use, it should be superconducting because it will need continuous operation.\u201d China approved the machine in 1998, as part of a push towards new energy sources. Construction then began in 2000 in Hefei, in southern China. The 150-member EAST team imported some material and components, but designed and fabricated the bulk of the equipment on its own. EAST is only one-tenth the volume of Japan's JT-60 tokamak, and one-hundredth the expected volume of ITER. It won't produce fusion power, and is designed to study advanced tokamak physics. The first plasma, created from heated hydrogen gas, will probably last for only a few seconds. Still, \u201cit will be a very important step forward,\u201d says Toshihide Tsunematsu, director-general of the Naka Fusion Institute of the Japan Atomic Energy Agency, who visited EAST a few weeks ago. The agency owns the JT-60 tokamak. Eventually, the EAST team aims to hold a plasma for study for as long as 1,000 seconds. In other tokamaks plasmas last for only a few tens of seconds. South Korea is currently developing a tokamak similar to EAST, called the Korean Superconducting Tokamak Reactor (KSTAR), whose construction is expected to be completed at the end of 2007. Japan also plans to upgrade its JT-60 machine to make it fully superconducting in a few years. International physicists praise what China has accomplished so far. In 2003, 25 physicists visited EAST as part of its international advisory committee. \u201cEverybody came away very impressed,\u201d says Dale Meade, a physicist with the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory in Princeton, New Jersey, and a member of the group. The committee plans to hold another meeting in October, when China hosts a conference of the International Atomic Energy Agency. In the meantime, the EAST researchers have plenty to work on, says Tsunematsu. They will have to improve key technologies, such as a device to heat the plasma, and be able to effectively control high-temperature plasma for a long period of time. \u201cChina will face a real challenge,\u201d he says.

Edited excerpts: \n               Monday 21 August \n             The proposal to define a planet as anything round that isn't a moon, and thus increase the tally in our Solar System to 12, is scheduled for discussion at lunchtime tomorrow. But many astronomers have already conveyed their objections to the executive committee of the International Astronomical Union (IAU) by e-mail \u2014 and some are supporting a second, rival definition. This alternative definition argues that a planet, as well as being round, must also be \u201cby far the largest object in its local population\u201d. This definition knocks Pluto off its planetary pedestal (although it offers it concessionary 'dwarf planet' status), and destroys the chances of promotion for Ceres, queen of the asteroid belt. Of the 100 people in the closed meeting last Friday where the alternative definition was floated, a show of hands showed about 50 for it and only 20 for the IAU's suggestion. 23:00  My dinner companions tonight include some (very tired) members of the Planet Definition Committee. They say they have received hundreds of e-mails over the past few days from geologists complaining about the proposal in the original definition to use 'pluton' to mean an object in the same class as Pluto. Pluton is a term of long-standing and wide use in geology, where it refers to an intrusion of igneous rock. Another problem has emerged in translation. The French name for Pluto is \u2014 you've guessed it \u2014 Pluton. The definition committee thought this linguistic borrowing would give the pluton label special appeal for French-speaking astronomers, but apparently some of them object. All this leads to speculation that tomorrow's revised definition, whatever other changes it contains, will include a replacement word for 'pluton'. \n               Tuesday 22 August \n             15:00  For people who often tell journalists that defining a planet is a meaningless labelling exercise, astronomers actually seem to care a great deal. The open discussion on what makes a planet stopped just short of fisticuffs. The official resolution has been divided into three parts, each of which will be voted on separately on Thursday at the closing ceremony. These cover the requirement of roundness; the distinction between a binary planet and a planet\u2013moon system; and the naming of Pluto-like objects. Within seconds of comments being invited, queues form at the microphones. One by one, astronomers denounce the definition in tones ranging from offended to furious. The representatives of the Planet Definition Committee slump into their chairs, heads propped on their hands. Andrea Milani of the University of Pisa is first to reach a microphone. He articulates the concerns of the 'dynamicists' \u2014 astronomers interested in orbits, many of whom feel strongly that the condition of dominating an orbital zone should be a central part of the definition. Milani becomes more incensed as he speaks, ending by saying \u201cyour paper is a kind of offence to the entire dynamical community\u201d. Meanwhile, those who work on extrasolar planets \u2014 some with many times the mass of Jupiter \u2014 feel that their field has been neglected. Why does the definition not set an upper mass limit? As this point was raised again and again, IAU president Ron Ekers became more and more frustrated. \u201cWe want your input, but not right now,\u201d he eventually snapped. 17:30  We are now on version three of the planet definition. I was expecting another lively show of dissent \u2014 but it is not to be, thanks to Jocelyn Bell Burnell, the astronomer who discovered the first pulsar. A member of the IAU's resolution committee, which decides what gets voted on, she takes formidable control of the meeting. With only 45 minutes available, she requires comments to be no more than 'elevator pitches' \u2014 sold in the time it takes a lift to travel one floor. The astronomers meekly follow her orders. The latest version requires that a planet be both round and, at the insistence of the dynamicists, dominant. Round objects that don't dominate their local orbital zone are 'dwarf planets'. Bell Burnell spells out the consequences: \u201cThis means that Pluto is a dwarf planet, but it is not a planet.\u201d Would that be acceptable to the assembled astronomers? It seems so. In a quick show of hands, more arms are raised in favour than against. \n               Thursday 24 August \n             The final text of the resolution (version four by my count) is posted in today's edition of the conference newspaper  Nuncio Sidereo III . According to this resolution, the Solar System has eight top-flight planets, with Pluto in a second class of dwarf planets. Separate votes will be held on whether to label these top-flight planets 'classical planets' and what, if anything, to do about putting Pluto and other round trans-neptunian snowballs into a 'plutonian object' category. \u201cOnly minor corrections can be accommodated at this stage,\u201d the paper warns. 11:30  I'm skipping down the stairs of the conference centre on my way to a 10.30 interview (not about planets) when I encounter a charge of scientists led by the esteemed Brian Marsden. \u201cYou're the press,\u201d one of his cohort notices. \u201cShow us to the press room.\u201d I retrace my steps. Marsden has, for many years, been the head of the Minor Planet Center at Harvard, a clearing house for orbital data on asteroids and comets. (This week's redefinitions are set to turn them into 'small Solar-System bodies'.) Today marks his retirement, but he enters the press room with youthful vigour. He holds up an A4 sheet of paper, on which is written in very large letters the word 'Planetino'. \u201cPlanetino is what they say in the resolution is a dwarf planet,\u201d he proclaims. Pointing to the ten or so astronomers straggling in behind him, Marsden says his proposal to call 'dwarf planets' 'planetinos' instead has support from representatives of Uruguay, Brazil, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Norway, Serbia and the United Kingdom \u2014 at least. The press room descends into a hubbub as reporters grab their notepads or leap to their laptops. The press officers trying to run the show look on, bemused. 13:50  Just before the closing ceremony starts, a television crew searches for a miserable American. Pluto, after all, was discovered at the Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff, Arizona, by the American Clyde Tombaugh. The search so far seems to have been fruitless. But I do see someone waving a picture of Pluto the Disney dog somewhere near the front... 14:35  \u201cYou will need a pen or a pencil,\u201d says Bell Burnell, who is chairing the session. The audience duly rummages in its bags, in order to add inverted commas to the category 'dwarf planets' and clarify the situation over satellites. A speaker from the floor suggests, to much laughter, dropping all the resolutions except footnote 1 to 5A: \u201cThe eight classical planets are: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune.\u201d 14:43  At last, the vote. Astronomers wave little yellow cards in the air to indicate their support for resolution 5A \u2014 that's the one that recognizes three categories of object: planets, 'dwarf planets' and small Solar-System bodies. A few people wave their cards to vote the resolution down, a few abstain. A moment's hesitation from the chair. Then: \u201cI believe the resolution is clearly carried.\u201d Amazing! A decision! I wouldn't have predicted that at the week's beginning. Bell Burnell brings out teaching aids from under the table. A blue balloon to represent the planets. A stuffed Disney Pluto and a box of cereal (Ceres, therefore cereal, get it?) stand in for the 'dwarf planets'. There's something indistinguishable and lumpy for the small Solar-System bodies. Next, a vote on resolution 5B. Are classical planets and 'dwarf planets' all planets proper, giving us two classes of planets and making 'planet' an umbrella term? (Out comes an umbrella labelled 'planets'.) Ninety-one in favour. The number against is overwhelming \u2014 no need to count again. \u201cIt's clear that resolution 5B is not passed,\u201d the chair reports. So, we have eight planets only. Pluto is out. Straight after the vote, I see Richard Binzel of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, a member of the Planet Definition Committee. He says, with some relief, \u201cit's over, it's done.\u201d Oh no it's not.

The future of the Solar System \u2014 or at least that of some of its nomenclature \u2014 may be thrown into turmoil by scientists who are calling for a boycott of a new definition of a planet. On 24 August, delegates at the general assembly of the International Astronomical Union (IAU) in Prague voted to define the planets of the Solar System by three criteria. To deserve planet status, the assembly agreed, a chunk of rock or ball of gas must be big enough for its gravity to have made it round, must orbit the Sun but not be a satellite of another planet, and must have cleared other bits of debris from its orbit. Round objects, including Pluto, that failed on the final count became not planets but 'dwarf planets'. The definition originally proposed on 16 August by the IAU would have had just two criteria \u2014 roundness and not being a moon. This was rejected by members at the meeting where the three-part definition was voted on as the final word on the subject. But many IAU members were not in Prague for the vote, and some are furious at the outcome. \u201cI am just disgusted by the way the IAU, which is meant to represent the best in science, handled this matter,\u201d says Alan Stern, a planetary scientist at the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colorado. As principal investigator for NASA's New Horizons mission to Pluto, he has a particular interest in its status. But he says the issue is not really Pluto's status so much as the idea of putting objects in orbital contexts. \u201cWe do not classify objects in astronomy by what they are near,\u201d he says. \u201cWe classify them by their properties.\u201d The day after the new definition was unveiled, Stern was among a dozen scientists who launched a petition to contest it. By e-mail, they sought the support of their colleagues for the following statement: \u201cWe, as planetary scientists and astronomers, do not agree with the IAU's definition of a planet, nor will we use it. A better definition is needed.\u201d More than 200 people had added their names to the petition as  Nature  went to press on Tuesday. Stern thinks that requiring a planet to have 'cleared its orbit' rules out some of the Solar System's other eight planets. These include Neptune, the orbit of which is crossed by Pluto, and Jupiter, which shares its orbit round the Sun with the Trojan asteroids. The 'clearing' criterion was introduced when astronomers who study the dynamics of the Solar System insisted that the definition should recognize their idea of what constitutes a planet \u2014 an object with a mass that dominates its orbital zone. Owen Gingerich, chair of the committee that proposed the 16 August resolution, thinks the IAU had no choice but to bend to the dynamicists' demands. \u201cThey may not have had a majority for anything positive, but they could rouse a strong negative majority simply because there are so many little fiefdoms,\u201d he explains. \u201cThe dynamics part of the definition is a rather complex one,\u201d says Ron Ekers, past IAU president. Couching the idea in terms of a planet 'clearing its orbit' was intended to make the issue easier for the public to understand. But it may well end up confusing matters. Some organizations have already said they will accept the IAU's new definition.  Encyclopaedia Britannica , for example, issued a statement saying that some of its articles on Pluto and the Solar System were updated online the same day the IAU's pronouncement was made. According to a spokesperson, later revisions may reflect any uncertainty, but \u201cthe vote by the IAU is considered binding \u2014 until the next vote, whether it's next year or next century\u201d. NASA, too, promised to abide by the definition, adding that it will \u201ccontinue pursuing exploration of the most scientifically interesting objects in the solar system, regardless of how they are categorized\u201d. Others are waiting to see how strong the counter-movement becomes. A black ribbon was tied around the Pluto panel at the Smithsonian Institution's National Air and Space Museum in Washington DC when the IAU's verdict was announced, says curator Andrew Johnston. But it has since been removed. \u201cWe're going to let things calm down for at least a few weeks before we decide to make any changes,\u201d he says. One thing that particularly irks critics is the way the decision was made. The IAU has nearly 9,000 members, but only 2,500 people attended the Prague meeting and only a few hundred were present for the vote. The IAU should have used the Internet to gauge wider opinion, and then allowed electronic voting, according to those who oppose the definition. \u201cThe IAU seems to be rooted in the pre-Internet age,\u201d says Mark Sykes, director of the Planetary Science Institute in Tucson, Arizona, who instigated the petition. \u201cThe rules of the IAU say that resolutions are passed by those present and voting,\u201d says Catherine Cesarsky, director of the European Southern Observatory and newly elected president of the IAU. Sykes allows that agreement on a \"better definition\" might be hard to come by, but is still pressing for the current one to be scrapped. He thinks the IAU would be better off without any definition at all rather than the one they have chosen. \u201cIf they can determine that this process was flawed and nullify it, then I think that would be in their best interests,\u201d he says. \u201cIf enough people are completely unhappy, we could go through the process again,\u201d says Ekers. But a new resolution would have to wait for the next general assembly in 2009 in Rio de Janeiro. The IAU may issue a clarifying statement in the next week or two, but is hesitating to do so now. \u201cPerhaps we need to make our next statement when things are a little less emotional,\u201d says Ekers. \n                     Pluto loses planet status \n                   \n                     Possible planets left with no name \n                   \n                     Astronomers reject the term 'planet' \n                   \n                     Nature newsblog on the planet definition \n                   \n                     NASA's New Horizons mission \n                   \n                     Encyclopaedia Britannica on Pluto \n                   \n                     International Astronomical Union \n                   \n                     IAU press release on planet definition \n                   \n                     Scientists' petition against planet definition \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

As the US government picks up the pace of building high-security biodefence laboratories, community groups and watchdogs are ramping up their protests. The latest clash centres on Fort Detrick, an army facility in Frederick, Maryland, that has long been home to biosecurity labs. The government is planning to overhaul the existing facilities and build a new biodefence research complex. Construction has already begun on one component: the Department of Homeland Security's National Biodefense Analysis and Countermeasures Center (NBACC). This is slated for completion in June 2008. But critics want to halt work on this facility and others in the works nationwide. On 30 August, opponents were scheduled to air their concerns at a public meeting in Frederick about Fort Detrick's expansion. \u201cFrom almost any way of looking at it, this makes absolutely no sense,\u201d says Barry Kissin, a lawyer and congressional candidate from Frederick, about the planned facility. \u201cThis does the opposite of provide for our security, at great expense and great hazard.\u201d Although local communities often protest about biodefence labs in their midst, the $105-million NBACC does stand out. Plans inadvertently posted on the Internet suggest that personnel there will conduct exercises known as 'red-teaming'. These would involve creating and testing biothreat agents thought to belong to enemy arsenals. The Department of Homeland Security is also attempting to classify the facility, which means activities there would be off-limits to public enquiry. The NBACC will include labs operating at the highest biosecurity level \u2014 biosafety level 4 \u2014 which handle the deadliest pathogens. This would be in addition to several biosafety level 4 facilities already in existence at the Fort Detrick campus. But critics say more labs will increase the threat to the surrounding community \u2014 they say pathogens could escape or be removed surreptitiously from the labs. Anthrax that was used in the unsolved mail attacks of late 2001, for instance, is thought to have come from a research lab. Opponents also charge that the facility runs the risk of spurring other countries to ramp up biowarfare activities: unless inspectors are allowed to investigate the site, some might suspect the United States of creating offensive weapons. \u201cIt's a really big mistake to classify the entire NBACC facility,\u201d says Alan Pearson, an expert on biological weapons at the Center for Arms Control and Non-proliferation in Washington DC. \u201cClearly there are going to be some aspects of the work that ought to be classified, but those ought to be minimal. Otherwise you start generating suspicions and, frankly, generating excuses for other countries.\u201d The department says that classification is necessary to prevent other nations from obtaining information about US weak points. \u201cProviding a secure environment for the handling of sensitive information in this way makes sense, and will not allow our enemies to gain the advantage should vulnerabilities be revealed,\u201d says Christopher Kelly, a spokesman for the department. Critics are also worried that the Department of Homeland Security could attempt to classify another project it has in the works: a $450-million complex of high-biosecurity labs and testing grounds called the National Bio and Agro-Defense Facility. The department is holding a nationwide competition to determine where the lab will be located; 12 sites remain in the running. Kelly says the department has no plans to classify the complex in question. But one site that has made the shortlist is the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California \u2014 which is already a classified facility. \u201cHow will the United States assure the rest of the world that the research is completely defensive if it's being conducted at a classified nuclear-weapons laboratory?\u201d asks Marylia Kelley, executive director of Tri-Valley CAREs, a Livermore-based group that monitors the national laboratory. NBACC and the bio\u2013agro facility are just part of a recent boom in biodefence spending in the United States. The federal government has spent $36 billion to combat bioterrorism since the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001, according to an analysis by the Center for Arms Control and Non-proliferation. Three additional biosafety level 4 labs are in the works, including one at Boston University in Massachusetts that has been heavily protested. Fourteen new biosecurity level 2 and 3 labs are also planned. Pearson argues that the country should spend more on working to prevent bioterrorism in the first place, by strengthening the United Nations' biological and chemical weapons conventions, and improving supervision of its own research. \u201cIt wouldn't take much money to strengthen prevention,\u201d he says, \u201cand it would do a lot more to keep us safe.\u201d \n                     Boom, or bust? \n                   \n                     Backyard biodefense rouses extreme reactions \n                   \n                     Biodefence on the research agenda \n                   \n                     Bioterrorism: Agriculture shock \n                   \n                     NIAID: The need for biosafety laboratory facilities \n                   \n                     Biodefense budget analysis by Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation \n                   \n                     Tri-Valley CARES \n                   \n                     DHS Fact sheet: NBACC \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

A bid by leading researchers to bring into the open data on bird flu that were previously kept behind closed doors has met with cautious optimism from observers. Some 70 avian-flu scientists from all corners of the globe have signed up to the Global Initiative on Sharing Avian Influenza Data (GISAID). A letter outlining the agreement was published online last week in  Nature  and appears in this week's issue (see  page 981 ). The move aims to resolve issues that have seen some countries and organizations come under fire for hoarding genetic information about avian flu strains. The reasons for their reluctance to share are varied: some, for example, fear that others might use the data without properly crediting the researchers involved. And there were concerns over whether countries worst hit by bird flu would benefit from the drugs and vaccines developed from the sequences they provide. Precise details of the GISAID agreement are still being thrashed out. But the idea is that participants will place genetic data into secure sections of existing online databases as soon as possible after producing and analysing them. Peter Palese, who studies flu viruses at Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York, describes GISAID as \u201ca very positive development\u201d. There are signatories from many of the countries affected by bird flu, including China, Indonesia, Thailand and Vietnam. And the Indonesian government has thrown its support behind free access to data. But Palese questions whether the agreement will work without the full involvement of all the scientists and governments in these countries. Menno de Jong, an avian-flu researcher at the Hospital for Tropical Diseases in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, also welcomes the initiative. But he cautions that care should be taken to ensure GISAID doesn't become \u201canother, albeit bigger, old boys' network\u201d. He suggests that increasing the capacity of poor countries affected by the disease to do their own research, enabling them to be more equal partners in collaborations, might be an extra encouragement for them to share their data. GISAID proposes pooling its data using the International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration, a network of three major public databases. The data will initially be accessible only to researchers who have signed up to GISAID, but the information will become open to the public no more than six months after it is deposited. GISAID members have also agreed to collaborate with, and appropriately credit, all relevant researchers in any resulting publications and intellectual-property agreements. Clinical and epidemiological data are included in the agreement. The hope is that researchers will be able to compare new strains against others quickly, for example to track whether a virus is acquiring mutations or becoming resistant to drugs. Until now, access to many genetic sequences has been restricted to a global network of flu labs associated with the World Health Organization (WHO). Dick Thompson, WHO spokesman in Geneva, says that the organization supports the sharing of sequence data. He notes that the WHO has sometimes been portrayed as wanting to keep data secret but says that is not the case. \u201cSometimes countries have legitimate reservations and we have to work with that,\u201d he says. John Sulston, of the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute in Cambridge, UK, says that he supports GISAID as a compromise. But he adds that because bird flu is spreading around the globe so fast, \u201cI still think it's a good idea to release data immediately.\u201d But virologist Ilaria Capua at the Experimental Animal Healthcare Institute in Padua, Italy, who campaigned for the initiative with Hollywood media adviser Peter Bogner, says she is very happy with the result. She adds that the framework could be used for other emerging infectious diseases. \u201cIf a new SARS knocks on our door, we have a system in place.\u201d \n                     Bird flu outbreaks in Indonesia going unstudied \n                   \n                     Family tragedy spotlights flu mutations \n                   \n                     Action stations \n                   \n                     Disease surveillance needs a revolution \n                   \n                     Flu researchers slam US agency for hoarding data \n                   \n                     Bird flu in focus \n                   \n                     Avian flu web focus \n                   \n                     GISAID \n                   \n                     WHO Avian Flu \n                   \n                     CDC Avian Influenza \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Chikyu  has run aground on high oil prices, which have more than doubled since the US$30-a-barrel days when much of the planning was done. This raises the cost of operating the ship, which consumes 110,000 litres of oil per day even when it's stationary and drilling. It also increases the cost of hiring crew, as  Chikyu  is competing with an oil industry scrambling to ramp up production to take advantage of high prices. As a result, estimates of annual running costs have jumped by 50%. The vessel, which cost \u00a560 billion ($500 million), was built to take the leading role in the Integrated Ocean Drilling Project (IODP), due to start in September 2007. The IODP is a collaboration of Japanese, US and European scientists who study rock and ice-core samples in search of clues about Earth's evolution. Japanese researchers are especially interested in collecting samples from deep fault regions, which can help show how tectonic plates shift during earthquakes. This month,  Chikyu  headed off to practice core sampling and analysis off the Japanese coast, after which it was due to join the IODP. But the rising running costs caused the ship's managers at the Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology (JAMSTEC) to change plans. From November the vessel will spend nine months working in the Indian Ocean off Kenya for an oil exploration project run by Australian petroleum company Woodside. \u201cThe alternative was just to have it sit in port,\u201d says JAMSTEC director Kiyoshi Suyehiro. As a non-profit organization, JAMSTEC won't receive any money from Woodside. But drilling for oil will at least be an opportunity to train the crew and test the riser drilling system, which is common in oil drilling but hasn't yet been used in research. Riser drilling uses circulating mud to prevent the hole from collapsing under high pressures, and so allows deeper digging. Chikyu  is designed to reach down 7,000 metres, even in deep waters \u2014 the only research vessel that can drill so deep. The oil project in Kenya will involve drilling 2-kilometre wells in ocean up to 3 kilometres deep, so it will provide a reasonable trial. The rough currents will also test  Chikyu 's thruster system, which keeps its position stable. But much of  Chikyu 's research equipment will sit idle. For example, as the core samples will belong to Woodside, the crew won't be able to analyse them using the vessel's magnetic resonance imaging devices. Chikyu  is still on course to begin scientific drilling in September 2007, but high running costs are likely to continue to plague the ship. Its first project will be to dig into the Nankai Trough, an earthquake-generating zone off the Japanese coast. The first stage, drilling down to 6,000 metres, is scheduled to take five years, but is likely to take much longer than expected unless oil prices drop or extra funding is secured to allow the vessel to operate continuously. JAMSTEC, which refuses to shift funds from its other ocean exploration projects, is pressing for extra money from the Japanese government. It has convinced the science ministry but will have a harder time persuading the finance ministry, which is trying to rein in the Japanese budget by \u00a514.3 trillion over the next five years. \n                     Budget plans hint at lean times ahead for Japanese research \n                   \n                     Ocean drilling: Digging in \n                   \n                     Ocean geologists hatch plan to probe ancient zone \n                   \n                     Woodside \n                   \n                     JAMSTEC \n                   \n                     IODP \n                   \n                     Seadrill \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

After nearly three years in space, Europe's Moon mission is out of fuel. On 3 September the spacecraft SMART-1 will smash into the lunar surface near the Lake of Excellence in the Moon's mid-southern latitudes. Astronomers hope the dust kicked up from the rocky site will provide information about the Moon's composition and impact history. Researchers at the European Space Agency (ESA) are very happy with what the mission has achieved. The craft was the agency's test-bed for a new type of thruster called an ion engine. SMART-1 is the second such engine to be used in space \u2014 the first was on board NASA's comet-chaser Deep Space 1. Ion engines work by accelerating a stream of ionized atoms through an electric field. The one on SMART-1 provides about as much force as a postcard resting in the palm of your hand. That made its journey painfully slow: it took 14 months and a roundabout trip of 84 million kilometres for it to spiral out of Earth's orbit and reach the Moon. In contrast, Apollo 11's conventional propellants allowed it to travel a roughly 400,000-kilometre line between Earth and the Moon in just over 3 days. The upside is that SMART-1's journey used around 70 kilograms of fuel, about ten times less than would have been needed with regular propellants. So, although ion engines pick up speed quite slowly, they are extremely effective \u2014 and fast \u2014 for long-distance trips using light craft. Learning to drive an ion engine is different from using chemical propellants, according to SMART-1 project scientist Bernard Foing. Chemical propellants are used in short burns lasting seconds or minutes. For those critical periods a craft must be precisely controlled, but otherwise it coasts passively to its destination. But ion drives are always on, so the course of the craft must be constantly monitored and corrected. \u201cIt's much more complicated than driving with chemical energy,\u201d says Foing. Despite a few episodes in which the engine spontaneously switched itself off, Foing says that SMART-1 performed well \u2014 good news for ESA's upcoming BepiColombo mission to Mercury in 2013. BepiColombo will use conventional propellants to break out of Earth's orbit quickly, then an ion drive to speed towards the Sun. The engine's tiny but continuous thrust over the course of months should cut flight time in half. Once SMART-1 arrived at its destination, it used a digital camera and two spectrometers to survey the Moon's surface. The craft orbited for 22 months gathering data on the abundances of calcium, aluminium, magnesium and silicon on the lunar surface. Several teams have been awaiting the release of the full results. For example, Wim van Westrenen, a petrologist at the Free University in Amsterdam, hopes they will help him investigate the Moon's origin. Most lunar researchers believe that the satellite formed when another body crashed into Earth billions of years ago. But it's not clear, for example, which of the two colliding bodies contributed most of the Moon's mass. \u201cThere are dozens of models for where and how and what materials melted in the Moon,\u201d says van Westrenen. In a five-year project starting in January 2007, he hopes to work out how the process occurred by crushing various combinations of materials at the high temperatures and pressures that would have been present when the Moon formed, to try to recreate the exact composition detected by SMART-1. ESA's mission will be followed by a glut of lunar visits. In 2007, Japan is scheduled to launch SELENE, a 3-tonne spacecraft that will survey the Moon's mineralogy, topology and gravity gradients. The same year, India will launch Chandrayaan-1 and China will launch Chang'e 1 \u2014 both will be those countries' first missions beyond Earth orbit. In 2008 NASA will launch its Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter to survey the Moon's surface. The overlap probably has more to do with national pride than science. But Paul Spudis, a lunar specialist at Johns Hopkins University's Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Maryland, says that the data will be welcome nonetheless. In the rush to beat the Soviet Union to the Moon, the Apollo programme did only piecemeal mapping of the satellite's surface. And after astronauts finished their visits, he says it was ignored for decades by planetary researchers. \u201cMars has better global imaging than the Moon does.\u201d \n                     SMART-1 arrives at the Moon \n                   \n                     Ion-powered probe set for year-long Moon trek \n                   \n                     Europe to shoot for the moon \n                   \n                     Human spaceflight In Focus \n                   \n                     Mars In Focus \n                   \n                     Space Shuttle Special \n                   \n                     Space and astronomy news \n                   \n                     SMART-1 homepage \n                   \n                     More on past and future lunar missions \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Four mathematicians were today due to collect gold medals and glory in Madrid, Spain, having been declared winners of the 2006 Fields Medals \u2014 referred to as the 'Nobel prizes' of mathematics. But only three turned up. Grigory Perelman, a reclusive Russian mathematician who was widely expected to be one of this year's winners (see ' Maths 'Nobel' rumoured for Russian recluse '), was indeed honoured at the opening ceremony of the International Congress of Mathematicians. But after a round of applause, president of the International Mathematical Union John Ball said \"I regret that Dr Perelman has declined to accept.\" No explanation was given. Perelman's presence at the prize-giving ceremony, presided over by the King of Spain, was not expected. He was invited to give a plenary lecture, but never replied. A UK newspaper,  The Sunday Telegraph , reported on 20 August that it had tracked down Perelman to a flat in St Petersburg, where he reportedly lives with his mother. The mathematician is quoted as saying: \"I do not think anything that I say can be of the slightest public interest. I have published all my calculations. This is what I can offer the public.\" Nobel prizes have been turned down six times: twice by the winners, and four times because winners were forbidden to accept the award by their home countries. But the situation is unprecedented for the Fields medal.  Ball told  Nature   before the medallists were announced that it was unclear what would happen \u2014 to the money or the honour \u2014 if someone refused the award.  \n              Multi dimensions \n            The Russian mathematician is believed to have proved the famous Poincar\u00e9 conjecture in three papers posted online in 2002 and 2003. This seemingly simple conjecture notes that a sphere with a two-dimensional surface (as all spheres are in our normal experience) has the essential property that a slip-knot tied around any point of it can be pulled to a single point without cutting the string or breaking the sphere; a donut, in contrast, does not have this property. The Poincar\u00e9 conjecture posits that there is a similar property for a sphere with a three-dimensional surface \u2014 but proving it has been tricky. \"Perelman's work is fantastic,\" says Michael Freedman, a mathematician who now works at Microsoft and was awarded the Fields Medal in 1986 for proving a statement equivalent to the Poincar\u00e9 conjecture in four dimensions. The only downside to the work, he says, is the finality of it. \"I did have a twinge of sadness. You like to see progress in the field, but you also hate to see a beautiful problem solved.\" To explore the beautiful problem, Perelman used a mathematical tool known as Ricci flow, developing new tricks to study the deformation of surfaces. He is awarded the Fields medal, formally, \"for his contributions to geometry and his revolutionary insights into the analytical and geometric structure of the Ricci flow\".  His possible proof of the Poincar\u00e9 conjecture has been the focus of fierce attention, both among mathematicians and in the media, but Perelman himself has withdrawn from the public's gaze.  \n              Go for gold \n            The other three Fields Medals were given to Andrei Okounkov, of Princeton University, New Jersey, Terence Tao of the University of California, Los Angeles, and Wendelin Werner of the University of Paris-Sud in Orsay, France, for bodies of work spanning statistical mechanics to patterns in prime numbers. The Medals are awarded once every 4 years to mathematicians no older than 40. As well as a gold medal with the winner's name inscribed on the rim, the prize comes with about Cdn$15,000 (US$13,300). Perelman may be due an additional prize from the Clay Mathematics Institute in Cambridge, Massachusetts, which offers US$1 million for the proof of the Poincar\u00e9 conjecture as one of their Millennium Prizes. A decision has yet to be made by the Institute as to whether Perleman's proof stands up to enough scrutiny for this award. But even if honoured, if Perelman follows form he may not claim this one either.  \n             Visit our  \n             \n                 newsblog \n               \n              to read and post comments about this story.  \n           \n                   International Congress of Mathematicians 2006 \n                 \n                   The Fields Medal \n                 \n                   Prizes given by the International Mathematical Union \n                 Reprints and Permissions"},

Drought hit the Amazon last year, with devastating results. Rivers fell, fish rotted and routes to schools and hospitals were cut off. Now studies of the dry spell suggest that such conditions could become increasingly common. The drought first caught scientists' interest because its cause was unusual. Dry spells in the Amazon usually occur in El Ni\u00f1o years, when warm water off the Pacific coast of South America sets up a pattern of circulating air that inhibits rainfall in the Amazon. But last year was not an El Ni\u00f1o year. Instead, the drought was caused by a circulation pattern powered by warm seas in the Atlantic \u2014 the same phenomenon responsible for last year's unusually intense Atlantic hurricane season. The result was a dry spell that hit particularly hard in the western Amazon, a region that normally has more rainfall than other parts of the forest. \u201cIt caught people by surprise,\u201d says William Laurance, an ecologist with the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute, based in Balboa, Panama. \u201cWe hadn't seen a drought like that before.\u201d The media quickly blamed global warming, but climate researchers warn that it may not be possible to make such a link \u2014 in part because vast areas of Amazonia have no weather stations. But early results from studies suggest that the Amazon could have more such events in the future. In a paper to be finalized this month, researchers from the United Kingdom and Brazil use a climate model developed at the Hadley Centre for Climate Prediction and Research in Exeter, UK, to study whether the 2005 event was a one-off or a taste of things to come. The team says the model predicts the latter. \u201cThe 2005 situation will be more frequent by 2050,\u201d says co-author Jose Marengo of the Center for Weather and Climate Prediction in Cachoeira Paulista, Brazil. Last year's drought also bolsters a controversial 2004 finding about the future of the Amazon rainforest. Peter Cox of the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology in Winfrith, UK, who is also an author of the new paper, had predicted that more frequent droughts would wipe out around 65% of the Amazon forest cover by 2090 (P. M. Cox  et al .  Theor. Appl. Climatol.   78,  137\u2013156; 2004). Many questioned the result when it was published, in part because some of the droughts predicted by the model were caused by warm waters in the Atlantic \u2014 a phenomenon that hadn't been observed at the time. Now that such an event has been seen, says Laurance, researchers are looking at Cox's results with a little less scepticism. Other studies disagree, predicting less drought and forest destruction than Cox's model. But more and more evidence suggests that drought will take a serious toll on the Amazonian forest. Daniel Nepstad, an ecologist at the Woods Hole Research Center in Massachusetts, has been simulating drought since 1998 with a plastic canopy covering 10,000 square metres of forest in the eastern Amazon. His results show that during drought, more large trees die off, all trees produce less wood, and there are more fires. In a paper under review at  Ecology , Nepstad calculates that the combination of dead trees and reduced wood formation in Amazonia as a whole led to an extra half-a-billion tonnes of atmospheric carbon in 2005. In contrast, the Kyoto Protocol on Climate Change aims to reduce global carbon emissions by a billion tonnes annually by 2012. Nepstad is now lighting test fires to assess whether one fire makes the forest more vulnerable to others. \u201cOur biggest fear is that the forest will be invaded by highly flammable grasses,\u201d he says. \n                     Amazon hit by worst drought for 40 years \n                   \n                     Rainforest breathes out \n                   \n                     Making waves \n                   \n                     Daniel Nepstad's drought simulation experiment \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Russian physicist Oskar Kaibyshev was given a six-year suspended prison sentence last week for exporting technologies with possible military use to South Korea. Human-rights advocates say the accusation is baseless and part of a series of prosecutions unjustly targeting Russian scientists. Kaibyshev, the suspended director of the Institute for Metals Superplasticity Problems in Ufa, was also fined about US$130,000 and banned from resuming his directorship for three years. Reports say he intends to appeal against the verdict. In 2002, Kaibyshev's institute sent samples of aluminium alloys and a titanium product to a tyre company in Seoul, South Korea. The materials allow better high-pressure tyres to be made, but the prosecution said they could also be used in manufacturing missiles. Agents of the Russian Federal Security Service first arrested Kaibyshev in March 2003 after seizing documents from a South Korean business delegation, including representatives from the tyre company and the Korea Aerospace Research Institute, at the airport in Ufa. He was arrested again in February 2005. Kaibyshev's supporters say the information he provided was public knowledge. \u201cEvery country has the right to defend its state secrets, but Kaibyshev's defence has clearly proved that all information he passed on was previously published in books and journals,\u201d says Eugene Chudnovsky, a condensed-matter physicist at the City University of New York who chairs the human-rights division of the New York Academy of Sciences. Over the past decade, Russian courts have given lengthy prison sentences to a number of scientists convicted of spying. Prominent examples include physicist Valentin Danilov and military analyst Igor Sutyagin, who were sentenced to 14 and 15 years, respectively, in 2004. Several other Russian scientists are also being held in custody for alleged espionage and high treason, and there may be more unpublicized cases, says Chudnovsky. Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, science in Russia has suffered financially. Foreign grants and collaborations have helped keep many institutes alive. But accusations against scientists who work with foreign groups or companies have also become widespread. The threat of prosecution is making things tense for Russian scientists who maintain international contacts and aim to commercialize their research, says Sarah Olmstead of the human-rights programme at the American Association for the Advancement of Science. Prosecutors in Kaibyshev's case had called for an unsuspended six-year sentence. The relatively mild verdict could be due, some say, to international outrage over the case. \u201cIt's a big relief to us all, but one case doesn't make a statistic,\u201d says Chudnovsky. \u201cI'm still waiting for an imprisoned scientist to be released before I can believe that things are getting better.\u201d \n                     Russian security arrests institute head for spying \n                   \n                     Scientists decry \u2018spy\u2019 verdict for Russian physicist \n                   \n                     Russian scientists face long fight for justice \n                   \n                     Russia's prize fighter \n                   \n                     New York Academy of Sciences \n                   \n                     AAAS Human Rights Programme \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Researchers have identified a gene that has changed rapidly during human evolution \u2014 a discovery that could be a step towards understanding what sets us apart from other animals. The work, reported online this week in  Nature , is some of the first to come from comparing the human genome with that of the chimpanzee, which was published last September. The gene, called  HAR1F , does not directly code for a protein. Instead, it lies in a non-coding segment of the genome and produces RNA. Many geneticists believe that rapidly evolving non-coding regions harbour the secret of what makes humans different from our nearest primate relatives. HAR1F  is produced by cells in the brain called Cajal\u2013Retzius cells, which regulate how the six layers of the cortex are laid down during development. The gene may interact with a protein called reelin, which plays a vital role in this layering. \u201cBut it's wild speculation,\u201d says geneticist David Haussler of the University of California, Santa Cruz, who led the study. The group identified the gene by comparing the human genome with those of the chimpanzee, mouse and rat. Forty-nine segments, dubbed 'human accelerated regions' or HARs, showed sequence changes in the human version but not in the other animals. The greatest change was found in HAR1, which in humans had undergone 18 substitutions in comparison with the other animals when one or none was expected (D. Haussler  et al .

Toronto Scientists, governments and funding agencies need to revise their strategy for deploying and testing HIV-prevention methods, delegates to the XVI International AIDS Conference in Toronto, Canada, heard this week. Although conventional prevention methods, such as the use of condoms, have had some success, advocates say that women need to have more control over prevention. Various new approaches, including the externally applied gels known as microbicides or drugs taken orally, show promise, said leaders in the fight. Challenges remain, however, in bringing such methods to the clinic. \u201cThere are serious obstacles that could significantly delay, or even derail, critical prevention trials \u2014 including inadequate resources and capacity to launch and complete trials, and emerging ethical concerns,\u201d warned a group of scientists, doctors and activists called the Global HIV Prevention Working Group. A 15 August report from the coalition called on governments and scientists to focus on the most promising interventions, set up trial sites, and coordinate their plans to avoid wasting time and money duplicating efforts. It also advised the creation of a panel of experts that could provide ethical guidance for the trials. And it urged societies to prepare for the roll-out of new prevention methods if they prove successful. The warnings aim to reduce the problems already hampering efforts to find alternative prevention methods. For example, activists' concerns, such as over whether people who contracted HIV during the trial would receive treatment afterwards, shut down two trials on preventive drugs in Cambodia and Cameroon in 2004 and 2005. Scientists hope that interest from big funding groups, such as the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, based in Seattle, Washington, could focus attention on these preventive efforts. Trials are currently testing the effects on HIV infection of microbicides, orally-ingested drugs, male circumcision, barriers such as diaphragms and the treatment of herpes infections. But the studies are costly and difficult to run. \u201cWe need to make strategic choices, and I hope Gates is going to give leadership in the way that is finally happening in the vaccine field,\u201d says Joep Lange, chairman of the International AIDS Society's Industry Liaison Forum. Trial results can also be complicated when counselling, provided with the trial, cuts the rate of new infections. For instance, the first completed trial of oral prevention drugs, reported at the meeting, tested whether the oral drug tenofovir prevented new infections in 936 women mainly in Ghana. But too few people became infected, so it was difficult to tell whether the drug actually worked, said Leigh Peterson of Family Health International, which conducted the trial with money from the Gates Foundation. The foundation has already led efforts to coordinate research on a microbicide, and helped write a strategy for microbicide development, due to be released on 17 August. Renee Ridzon, a senior programme officer at the foundation, said it is keenly aware of the need to coordinate prevention trials. \u201cThe field needs to think hard about this,\u201d she said. \u201cIt's definitely on our radar screen.\u201d \n                     Toronto crossroads \n                   \n                     AIDS vaccine research becomes 'big science' \n                   \n                     Drop in HIV infection rate used to justify focus on morality \n                   \n                     Starting to gel \n                   \n                     AIDS blog 2006 \n                   \n                     AIDS Special 2004 \n                   \n                     Gates Foundation \n                   \n                     Global HIV Prevention Working Group \n                   \n                     AIDS Conference 2006 \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

But its flagship programme is controversial; some say it pushes abstinence too heavily. Erika Check sat down with Mark Dybul, US Global AIDS Coordinator, at the international AIDS meeting in Toronto this week, to discuss US strategy. \n              The big US programme is the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR). What are PEPFAR's accomplishments? \n           We've supported care for 3 million people so far \u2014 1.2 million of them are vulnerable children and orphans. For prevention of mother-to-child transmission, we've supported services for 4.2 million women. Of those, 340,000 received short-term prophylaxis, averting approximately 65,000 infant infections.  The work isn't being done by international organizations. It's being done by people at the local level, providing services at ground zero.  \n              Is the balance of prevention and treatment now right? \n            Three-and-a-half years ago, President Bush had the vision to say prevention, treatment and care need to go together. PEPFAR started that wave. So we're delighted to hear people now saying prevention should be on equal footing with treatment.  \n              Some say that PEPFAR is hiring so many local people that it is undermining the country's own infrastructure for aid. Are you remedying that? \n            I've heard some of those anecdotes, but we've got more anecdotes about how we're supporting massively programmes in the public sector. Thirty per cent of our resources go for health workers. There's a lot of shifting back and forth. UN agencies also hire people, and the public sector gets people from [non-governmental organizations]. But what we've seen is an expansion of the total number of people available.  \n              What can you say about the reports from Uganda alleging that PEPFAR's strategy of focusing on abstinence has reduced condom use and resulted in a greater spread of HIV? \n            It would be nice to look at facts. In 2001 we supported 7 million condoms for Uganda. In 2005 it was 45 million. It's tough to argue we are shying away from condoms in Uganda.  What we try to do is support the local programme, which is the ABC [Abstinence, Be faithful, use Condoms] programme. It's simply untrue that we don't support full ABC programmes in Uganda \u2014 all you have to do is look at the numbers. We don't do abstinence-only, except in very young kids.  \n              Is there more that can be done, beyond ABC? \n            We support gender-equality programmes. We're looking at alcohol in a number of countries because alcohol is driving the epidemic. We're doing a lot of cross-generational sex education to try to reduce cross-generational sex, because the one place where stigma is good is stigmatizing older men who prey on younger women.  \n              President Bush made a five-year commitment to the PEPFAR programme, until 2008. What happens next? \n            By 2008 there will be countries where PEPFAR is supporting AIDS programmes of over half a billion dollars. We can't expect countries to absorb that. We understand there is going to need to be financial support for quite a while in many of these countries. No one is talking about walking away from the support the American people have provided.  What should be the proper mix between bilateral aid (direct from the US) and multilateral aid (through organizations like the Global Fund)? Right now it should be heavily bilateral because that's where we move fastest. That doesn't mean that should be the case indefinitely and we need to look at that. The question is what will come after, and there will be a lot of work over the next year trying to look at what that should be. Using the evidence we've accumulated through PEPFAR we'll have a sense of what should come next.  \n              Will the PEPFAR strategy be expanded? \n            If we have microbicides available, if male circumcision is proven effective, these will be things we need to look at. We need to build infrastructure, not only for implementing new technologies but also for behaviour change. We're going to need to look at that as we move forward. \n                   AIDS Conference 2006 blog \n                 \n                   AIDS Conference 2004 special \n                 \n                   Uganda Ministry of Health \n                 \n                   AIDS Conference 2006 \n                 Reprints and Permissions"},

When trap-jaw ants need to get out quick, they use their heads, not their legs to escape. This large species of Costa Rican ant smashes its jaw into the ground, causing the ant to catapult up and away from danger.  Videos of  Odontomachus bauri  show that this ant can propel itself 8 centimetres up into the air using jaws that snap shut at a speed of nearly 65 metres per second \u2014 perhaps the fastest predatory strike measured. Brian Fisher of the California Academy of Sciences, San Francisco, and colleagues filmed the ants to help settle a lab bet about whether it was faster than the mantis shrimp, which flails its club-shaped front leg at peak speeds of 23 metres per second to shatter the hard shells of its prey. The team used a high-speed video camera to film seven trap-jaw ants in action at 50,000 frames per second ( see videos ). The results were a surprise. \"We found that the jaws were closing at triple the speeds previously thought,\" says Sheila Patek, a biologist and co-author on the paper. The team's results are published in the  Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 1 . The snapping jaw gives the ants a bizarre multi-purpose tool for hunting and defence. The ants often approach other insects with their jaws cocked open. Snapping them shut can both give the ant a quick escape and also knock down the combatant, stunning it so the ant can come back with a successful attack. The ant can also cock its head sideways and strike its mandible against the floor. The impact shoots its body upwards for nearly 0.3 seconds\u2014 long enough to avoid the tongue of a hungry lizard \u2014 before it lands haphazardly up to 40 cm away.  Helped by these skills,  O. bauri  thrives throughout Central and South America. They are amazing because of the way they work together to stay safe, says Fisher. \"A group of ants can confuse predators by performing multiple, simultaneous escape jumps, creating what I call the popcorn effect.\"  \n              Snap shot \n            The snapping speed is achieved in much the same way as a mousetrap. An ant cranks its mouth open by slowly contracting one set of muscles, and then holds it open with a couple of latches. When sensitive nerve endings \u2014 1-millimetre-long hairs along the edge of the jaw \u2014 are touched, the latches are released, and other muscles slam the jaw shut 2,000 times faster than the blink of an eye. The movement is faster than a cheetah's run (which can ramp up to 20 metres per second in under 2 seconds), or a jellyfish's throw of a lethal dart, clocked at an average of 14 metres per second. But it's slower than the dive of a peregrine falcon, which exploits gravity to reach speeds of 75 metres per second.   O. bauri  is not the only species of ant to use snapping jaws to snare prey, but it does seem to be the only one who uses the trick to perform escape jumps.  The researchers now hope to discover how the trap-jaw mechanism evolved across other ant genera, to see if other species are also capable of jumping to safety.  \"We have a lot to do,\" says Patek. \"One major area of interest is to understand how and when the ants fire their mandibles in different context. How do they decide to attack a large predator and bounce off it instead of directing their strike against the ground and propelling themselves away?\" \n             Visit our  \n             \n                 newsblog \n               \n              to read and post comments about this story. \n           \n                   Wikipedia - Odontomachus \n                 Reprints and Permissions"},

One-third of the world's population is living in water-scarce areas, say scientists behind a 5-year analysis of global water resources. The finding is a worrying update to an older study by the same team, who had previously predicted that such a situation would not arrive until 2025. \"This won't be in decades: it's here now,\" says Frank Rijsberman, director general of the International Water Management Institute in Battaramulla, Sri Lanka. Rijsberman launches the report today at the 2006 World Water Week in Stockholm, Sweden. Hundreds of scientists from more than 100 different institutions contributed to the study. The work improves upon a similar assessment from 2000, which looked primarily at the use of water for crops. The new study also includes water use for cattle and fisheries, and integrates new data on individual river basins, and satellite measurements of irrigated land area. Agriculture consumes a vast amount of our water, accounting for about 74% of the total water withdrawn from rivers, lakes and aquifers. In 2000, 7,200 cubic kilometres of water were used to grow food; by 2050, population growth is expected to see that increase to 11,000-13,500 cubic kilometres. That will require some changes in how water is used, say the report's authors, from desalinating sea water for use in irrigation to switching diets so that people rely more on less water-intensive crops.  \n              Not a drop to drink \n            Developing nations are, not surprisingly, revealed to be the hardest hit by water shortages, but for differing reasons. Large parts of sub-Saharan Africa have potential access to groundwater, for example, but lack the technology to exploit it. In Gujarat in India, by contrast, decades of over-extraction of groundwater for dairy farming has \"destroyed\" local resources, says Rijsberman. Some of these problems could be fixed through financial initiatives and sustainable use of basic technologies, says David Molden, a colleague of Rijsberman's. Access to 'micro-credit' initiatives would allow African farmers to invest in human-powered pumps and small-scale dams, for example, which could be used to see crops through unpredictable but frequent dry periods. But the authors also call for a more radical change in the way that water is thought about. \"People need to focus on getting more value from water,\" says Rijsberman. He argues that water is usually seen as a free resource, but needs to be treated as a limited commodity, and valued accordingly.  In Australia's Murray-Darling River basin, for instance, water scarcity has been caused by intensive agriculture, much of which is used to produce crops for export. Rijsberman says that the area is not necessarily water-scarce, and that local shortages could be alleviated by switching to crops that produce a greater financial return for each litre of water used - such as horticultural products instead of cereals. Such action needs to come from national governments, say Rijsberman and Molden, who hope that the report's political backers, which include the UN Food and Agriculture Organization, will help translate its recommendations into policy. There are already some encouraging signs: a strategy for investment in African water resources, released last year and backed by the World Bank, included substantial input from the authors. \n             Visit our  \n             \n                 newsblog \n               \n              to read and post comments about this story. \n           director general of the International Water Management Institute in Battaramulla, Sri Linka \n                   Focus on global water crisis \n                 \n                   Focus on climate and water \n                 \n                   International Water Management Institute \n                 \n                   World Water Week \n                 Reprints and Permissions"},

Heidi Ledford examines how researchers at one leading institution are coping. On a grim day last September, a ten-car convoy of researchers drove into the putrid waters of downtown New Orleans. Scientists fanned out across the Tulane University health-sciences campus, salvaging computers and research samples from buildings flooded in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. Today, the university campus buzzes with activity of a different sort. Undergraduate classes resumed in January, with 93% of students returning for the spring semester. Research experiments are again under way. And preliminary numbers suggest that Tulane earned $133 million in sponsored research last year \u2014 a mere 3% drop from the previous year. Tulane has emerged relatively unscathed compared with other institutions in New Orleans (see  'Around New Orleans' ). Yet even at Tulane, Katrina has left a permanent mark in the form of low morale, lost equipment and laid-off faculty members. On 29 August 2005, Katrina separated Tulane's two campuses by more than just geography. Floodwaters barely reached the stately buildings of the university's historic uptown campus for undergraduates. Science departments there were up and running after a few rough months of limited electricity and minor repairs. \u201cOn the undergraduate campus, you'd be hard pressed to find any evidence that there was a storm,\u201d says Robert Garry of the department of microbiology and immunology. \u201cBut other parts...well, it's not so good.\u201d These other parts of Tulane are located downtown, nearly 5 kilometres away, on the health-sciences campus. There, the waters rose to 2 to 3 metres, flooding electricity supplies and maintenance rooms on the lower floors. Some research labs began operating again as early as November, but others didn't reopen until January (see  'Winds of change: three stories from Tulane's faculty' ). Even then conditions were difficult: in the J. Bennett Johnston Health and Environmental Research Building, the first health-sciences building to reopen, some researchers were left warming their hands over Bunsen burners when temperature controls failed last winter. Back in August last year, electricity losses also doomed many experiments. It is safe to say that no one working in the biomedical sciences at Tulane will ever again take refrigeration for granted. Power failures and warm temperatures destroyed stem-cell lines, tissue cultures and antibodies, some of which were the products of years of specialized work. Only some samples were saved through emergency rescue efforts. \u201cWe lost in excess of $100 million of biological assets,\u201d says John Clements, dean of research at the medical school. \u201cBut we also saved $100 million of biological assets.\u201d Researchers credit the National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation with providing resources for recouping their losses, and Tulane itself has dedicated $20 million to research grants to be awarded over the next two years. Others lost far more \u2014 their jobs. The university, having sustained property damage of $160 million, sacked 180 medical-school faculty members on 8 December. Another 50 faculty members were laid off uptown, and the departments of mechanical engineering, civil engineering and computer science were eliminated altogether. Even today, the firings are perhaps the sorest spot for Tulane faculty members, with many questioning the decisions. Prescott Deininger, associate director of Tulane's cancer centre, says that the disaster demanded drastic action. He adds that he was consulted before the lay-offs were finalized, and he feels that his recommendations were taken into consideration before final decisions were made by the president's office and approved by the university's board of administrators. Tyler Curiel, chief of haematology and medical oncology, agrees that the situation was dire but says that the process of deciding which jobs to cut was not transparent enough. Although he was consulted early in the lay-off discussions, he says that he was not involved in any final decisions, nor was he ever clearly told how decisions were to be made. Meanwhile, he was fielding frantic phone calls from faculty members asking if they were going to be 'let go'. \u201cIt was a very frustrating time for all of us,\u201d says Curiel, who is leaving Tulane this month for the University of Texas Health Science Center in San Antonio. \u201cIt just wasn't handled well from a human standpoint.\u201d The American Association of University Professors (AAUP) has been investigating the firing decisions at Tulane. Jordan Kurland, the association's associate general-secretary, says that Tulane mostly abided by the AAUP's recommended standards, which allow tenure to be cancelled in cases of extreme financial need. But more could have been done, he suggests. \u201cTulane authorities have provided general information as to the financial health of Tulane,\u201d says Kurland. \u201cBut they have not, despite urgings to do so, taken the next step and explained why they fired these particular people.\u201d Clements says that critics don't understand the magnitude of the crisis. \u201cIf you're on a ship and the ship is sinking, the captain doesn't want to poll the deckhands to figure out what to do,\u201d he says. He also notes that Tulane has offered its laid-off clinical faculty members a one-year severance package \u2014 which amounts to a better deal than those provided by other institutions in New Orleans. Including lay-offs and voluntary resignations, Tulane University has lost 17% of its full-time faculty members in the past year. Many of the remaining faculty members have been approached by other universities. Administrators hope that the faculty exodus is now over and that those who have stayed this long are committed to staying. But Curiel predicts that there may be another wave of resignations on the horizon. Pharmacologist Bruce Bunnell says he couldn't help but entertain the thought of leaving. \u201cTulane's been fantastic to me, but science is one of these things where you make your own way,\u201d he says. \n                     Is the city safe? \n                   \n                     Research losses surface in hurricane Katrina's aftermath \n                   \n                     Texan labs batten hatches against Hurricane Rita \n                   \n                     Hurricane Katrina: Left behind \n                   \n                     Briefing: devastation in New Orleans \n                   \n                     Tulane University \n                   \n                     Tulane University Health Sciences Center \n                   \n                     NIH Katrina site \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

In this, the first part Erika Check investigates whether paying donors would increase supply. In the  second  part Helen Pearson asks what is known about the long-term health risks faced by donors.  Should women be paid for the time, discomfort and health risks involved in donating eggs for research? The world's largest group of stem-cell scientists is grappling with the question, and has now asked the public for its views. Stem-cell researchers want eggs so they can work on somatic cell nuclear transfer, or 'therapeutic cloning'. They hope to derive embryonic stem cells matched to patients' DNA, by transferring the nucleus of one of the patient's cells into a human egg and developing it into an embryo from which cells can be derived. The technique has great medical potential \u2014 but researchers are far from achieving it, and the main limiting factor in the research is the availability of human eggs to practise on. So far, scientists have relied on women already undergoing fertility treatment donating their extra eggs for research. But the supply is meagre. To help persuade them, several labs are increasingly offering financial rewards, such as cheaper fertility treatment. Others are starting to ask healthy women to donate \u2014 triggering a debate about how such women should be compensated. Some ethicists argue that women should receive compensation for the discomfort and effort involved. Others are worried that this will create an undue incentive that will coerce women \u2014 especially poorer ones \u2014 into giving up their eggs. The fact that so little is known about the long-term health risks of the procedure further complicates the picture (see 'Health effects of egg donation may take decades to emerge', opposite). Scientists in many parts of Europe, Asia, the Middle East and North America ask women to donate eggs for research, but they all treat the practice differently. Scientists at the North East England Stem Cell Institute announced on 27 July that they had got permission from the UK Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority to pay part of the cost of  in vitro  fertilization treatments for women who donate eggs for research (see  Nature   442 , 498; 200610.1038/442498a ). But other European countries that accept egg donation for research, such as Sweden, prohibit payment for anything other than direct expenses. Japan bans egg donation altogether because of the risk of complications, whereas China, along with several other countries, does not specifically address the question. In the United States, a National Academies panel recommended last year that women should be reimbursed only for direct expenses. This approach has been adopted by the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine, and by the state of Massachusetts, home of the Harvard Stem Cell Institute (see  Nature    doi:10.1038/news060605-6 ; 2006). Both institutes are asking healthy women to donate eggs for research. But even their policies differ \u2014 for instance, California law would allow paying the travel expenses of women who come from out-of-state to donate eggs, whereas it's not clear how Harvard will handle this question. \u201cAt the moment we're confining the search to this area,\u201d says spokesman B. D. Colen. Scientists want international guidelines so that they can share materials without worrying about how they were derived. So a task force of the International Society for Stem Cell Research (ISSCR) is considering the compensation question as part of a larger effort to draw up guidelines. The task force, made up of scientists, ethicists and lawyers from 14 countries, was convened last year after the revelation of scientific misconduct by South Korean stem-cell researcher Woo Suk Hwang: as well as faking evidence of 11 human embryonic stem-cell lines derived by therapeutic cloning, he lied about paying hundreds of women for eggs, and obtained eggs from his female subordinates. On 30 June, the ISSCR task force released draft guidelines at its annual meeting in Toronto. The guidelines embrace most of the principles proposed by the National Academies last year. But they differ on the issue of egg donation. The task force leaves the door open for a more liberal policy on compensation by stating simply that stem-cell research projects should be reviewed by a local oversight body, which must ensure \u201cthere are no undue inducements or other undue influences for the provision of human materials\u201d. What constitutes 'undue' is left to the local oversight bodies. George Daley, a biologist at Harvard Medical School who chaired the task force, says that this is the best consensus the task force was able to achieve, because scientists and ethicists on the task force disagree so sharply about how egg donors should be treated (see ' Research volunteers or organ donors? ). The guidelines are seen as an important first step nonetheless, and are now open to public comment until 1 September, when the ISSCR will finalize the document. \u201cThese are going to be seen as the rules set by scientists themselves, from the inside out,\u201d says Kevin Eggan of the Harvard Stem Cell Institute. \u201cIt's very useful for scientists to show that they have thought about these issues.\u201d \n                     Health effects of egg donation may take decades to emerge \n                   \n                     Harvard enters human stem-cell race \n                   \n                     Cloning: Mining the secrets of the egg \n                   \n                     'Ripened eggs' used for cloning work \n                   \n                     Eggs donations are safer from sisters \n                   \n                     Stem cells in focus \n                   \n                     Stem cells Insight \n                   \n                     Stem cells podcast \n                   \n                     ESHRE \n                   \n                     ASRM \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

In the  first  part Erika Check investigated whether paying donors would increase supply. In this, the second part Helen Pearson asks what is known about the long-term health risks faced by donors.  In 1989, a healthy 32-year-old woman offered her infertile younger sister some of her healthy eggs, and with them the chance to have a baby. Doctors at the Cromwell IVF and Fertility Centre in London gave the donor hormones that made a batch of eggs in her ovary mature, and collected six eggs for fertilization. Three embryos were transferred to the younger sister and two were frozen. One baby girl was born. Five years later, the doctors contacted the egg donor to ask whether to discard her frozen embryos. They discovered that she had been diagnosed with late-stage colon cancer that spread to her skull. She died just before her thirty-ninth birthday. Doctors don't know if the fertility drugs caused or accelerated the woman's cancer. But the possibility prompted Cromwell infertility specialist Kamal Ahuja to report the case as a reminder of how little is known about the risks of donating eggs (K. E. Ahuja and E. G. Simons,  Hum. Reprod.   13 , 227\u2013231; 1998). \u201cIt shook us all up,\u201d he says. Specialists in reproductive medicine say there is insufficient information about the long-term risks of drugs used to stimulate ovulation, a practice that has become more common in the past 25 years, with the proliferation of  in vitro  fertilization (IVF) and assisted reproduction. But some studies have suggested the drugs may be linked to the development of certain cancers. The question is receiving renewed scrutiny now that scientists are asking healthy women to donate their eggs for stem-cell research \u2014 exposing them to the potential risks of ovulation stimulation without the end result of a baby (see Editorial,  page 601 ). To discuss the issue, the California Institute of Regenerative Medicine (CIRM) in San Francisco has convened a meeting of experts to be held next month. Britain's Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA) will also tackle the issue in a forthcoming consultation on egg donation for research. The uncertainty makes it even more difficult to reach a consensus on whether women who donate eggs should be compensated, and if so by how much (see ' Ethicists and biologists ponder the price of eggs '). \u201cThis discussion should emphasize long-term risk assessment rather than money,\u201d Ahuja says. During ovulation stimulation for IVF or egg donation, women are given drugs that encourage the ovary to ripen several eggs simultaneously, rather than the one egg normally ovulated each month (see ' What egg donation involves '). Doctors know that this can have side effects ranging from moodiness to infection. The most serious is ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome, which seriously affects about 6% of women receiving the drugs. Thirty or more eggs start to develop at once and fluid leaks out of blood vessels and collects in the abdomen, causing nausea, bloating and very occasionally kidney failure or even death. There is little information on how frequently ovulation stimulation has tragic side effects, says obstetrics and gynaecology professor Didi Braat of Radboud University Medical Centre in Nijmegen, the Netherlands, because doctors are often reluctant to report such cases and rarely have to. But deaths are thought exceptional: in a study reported at this year's meeting of the European Society for Human Reproduction and Embryology, Braat and her colleagues found only six deaths clearly linked to IVF from the medical records of some 100,000 women who underwent the procedure between 1984 and 2006. So some specialists are more worried about the long-term risks of fertility drugs. In the 1990s, for example, studies pointed to a link between fertility drugs and breast or ovarian cancer, although it's not clear how cancer would be promoted. One study suggested that women who took an ovulation-stimulating drug called clomiphene citrate for more than a year had 11 times the risk of developing ovarian tumours compared with the general population (M. A. Rossing  et al .  N. Engl. J. Med.   331 , 771\u2013776; 1994). But these studies are controversial. It might be infertility, not fertility drugs, that predisposes women to disease. Other aspects of women's reproductive lives influence ovarian and breast cancer \u2014 pregnancy is thought to protect against tumours, for example. And ovarian cancer is so rare that it's hard to get a large enough sample to spot any connection. Louise Brinton at the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, and her colleagues tried to control for these factors in one of the most comprehensive studies so far. They collected the medical records of more than 12,000 women who received ovulation-stimulating drugs between 1965 and 1988. The team did not find statistically significant increases in breast and ovarian cancer, but did find that the women were around 1.8 times more likely to develop uterine cancer (M. D. Althuis  et al .  Am. J. Epidemiol.   161 , 607\u2013615; 2005). Such studies have reassured many specialists that the risks of ovulation stimulation are insignificant. But Brinton and others studying the issue say the picture is still incomplete. Brinton's study involved mainly women who took clomiphene citrate, rather than the gonadotropin hormones introduced for IVF in the 1980s. Researchers have only had a decade or so to study significant numbers of women taking the newer drugs, but extra cancers may not appear until the women reach 50 or 60. Researchers also don't know whether studies on infertile women can be generalized to egg donors, who are typically younger and healthier. Epidemiologist Mary Croughan at the University of California, San Francisco, has unpublished data suggesting donors are at lower risk of cancer. But \u201cit's important to follow these women into the future\u201d, she says. She and other experts want more extensive studies to follow up women who have had IVF treatment or donated eggs. There is at least one large study of the long-term effects of ovarian stimulation under way in the Netherlands. But it's unclear who will drive the effort, particularly when private fertility clinics may have little interest in finding out the potential risks of the drugs they use. Ahuja suggests that an authority such as Britain's HFEA could coordinate such an investigation. Some argue that the researchers asking women for eggs should help pin down the health risks. \u201cThere is some kind of ethical obligation there,\u201d says Mildred Cho of the Stanford University Center for Biomedical Ethics in California. The September CIRM meeting will focus on these risks and discuss what relevant data might be collected in the course of the institute's research. \u201cIt's important for people to understand in the consent process that we don't know as much as we should about what those risks are,\u201d says Cho. Kevin Eggan of the Harvard Stem Cell Institute, for example, says that his group tells egg donors of the risks, and that they cancel the procedure if women show signs of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome. If the risks aren't made clear upfront, one well-publicized tragedy could kill efforts to find donors, adds John Buster, professor of obstetrics and gynaecology at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, Texas. \u201cIf a woman has a cardiac arrest while giving eggs for stem-cell research, it won't go down too well.\u201d \n                     Ethicists and biologists ponder the price of eggs \n                   \n                     Harvard enters human stem-cell race \n                   \n                     Cloning: Mining the secrets of the egg \n                   \n                     'Ripened eggs' used for cloning work \n                   \n                     Eggs donations are safer from sisters \n                   \n                     Stem cells in focus \n                   \n                     Stem cells Insight \n                   \n                     Stem cells podcast \n                   \n                     ESHRE \n                   \n                     ASRM \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

With no vaccine to show for more than 20 years of work, the HIV-vaccine community is being forced to radically change the way it works. Funding organizations are insisting on a 'big science' approach involving huge data-sharing collaborations. But AIDS researchers are divided over whether such a strategy will really speed progress towards a vaccine. When the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation announced a US$300-million call for proposals in HIV vaccine research last year, it marked a key change for researchers used to chasing investigator-driven grants. Individual groups need not apply, said the foundation. Instead, it demanded that research groups organize themselves into bigger consortia, then jointly submit large, multimillion-dollar proposals with clear milestones and goals. The consortia had to agree to share data with each other, and to ensure that any patents won would allow vaccines to be made available to developing countries at low cost. Researchers duly did as they were asked, and last month the Gates Foundation announced the winners of 16 grants, totalling $287 million over five years. They will establish an international network of 11 vaccine-discovery consortia, plus 5 support and data-analysis facilities \u2014 bringing together 165 investigators from 19 countries in a single effort (see ' Some of the winners... '). The move comes a year after the US National Institutes of Health put some $315 million over 7 years into a similar group of consortia to create the Center for HIV-AIDS Vaccine Immunology (CHAVI). The idea of large consortia working on AIDS vaccine research was put forward in 2003 by a group of research funders. It was outlined earlier this year by the Global HIV Vaccine Enterprise, a virtual consortium aimed at accelerating HIV vaccine development that was endorsed by the G8 summit in July. Instead of relying on researchers to form collaborations spontaneously, those with the money are now forcing it to happen, says Michel Kazatchkine, France's ambassador for AIDS and co-chair of the Enterprise coordination committee. Kazatchkine explains that instead of gathering and publishing their own data, researchers will be obliged to work with large, shared data sets, use standardized assays and methods, and farm out routine analyses to a series of centralized laboratories. Much of this isn't controversial. Most AIDS scientists agree that standardized methods are sorely needed, and there is broad support for the $100 million that the Gates Foundation is providing for five central facilities to help structure and coordinate the field. At present, groups use different cohorts, assays and surrogate markers. This makes it all but impossible to compare results to find the most promising vaccine candidates for clinical trials. Individual researchers have little incentive to improve matters, as developing standards involves mundane work that does not yield prestigious publications. More contentious are the 11 research grants to establish vaccine-discovery consortia \u2014 these are likely to be the talk of the corridors at next week's XVI International Aids Conference in Toronto, Canada. There are concerns about both the selection process (see ' A controversial choice ?') and the wisdom of investing so much money in a big-science approach. \u201cWe are having to learn a new culture and language relating to these milestones and directed research,\u201d says Robin Weiss of University College London, UK, who has won a $25.3-million grant. His consortium involves 11 labs in at least 6 countries. Getting them to work together effectively will be an organizational challenge, Weiss says, although he adds that they already \u201cfeel like a family\u201d. But Weiss is one of several AIDS researchers who argue that the community already cooperates well. \u201cI was a little surprised at the implication that we needed the Gates Foundation to tell us to collaborate,\u201d he says. Many researchers are concerned about the level of funding going to a mission-oriented approach versus investigator-driven science. \u201cIt's a difficult balance to get in vaccine discovery \u2014 it's not development, but research,\u201d says Weiss. \u201cI don't think an AIDS vaccine has been held up because we didn't know how to collaborate. The limiting factor is a scientific breakthrough, a bright idea and new thinking.\u201d Others argue that large mission-oriented grants could hold back the science. \u201cYou are going to get bad decisions,\u201d predicts one AIDS researcher who requested anonymity. He argues that the approach hands scientific choices to bureaucrats, and that the concentration of so much money in so few hands is a recipe for turf wars and nepotism \u2014 a criticism vocally expressed by US researchers left out of the CHAVI funding framework. He also questions whether large collaborations \u2014 which make sense in astronomy, where teams often study the same object at different wavelengths, or in tackling the vast amounts of data coming from the Human Genome Project \u2014 are as applicable to the experiments of vaccine research. The task of making big science work for HIV falls to Adel Mahmoud, who will retire next month as president of Merck's Vaccine Division to become chief executive of the Global HIV Vaccine Enterprise. Kazatchkine for one is a convert, arguing that the \u201cincredible egotism\u201d of individuals and institutions often creates communities that lack the vision to organize themselves productively: \u201cIf Mahmoud succeeds, he will demonstrate a new way of doing science, where collaboration becomes as important as competition, giving research a new image.\u201d See also  \n                     pages 602 \n                    and  \n                     617 \n                   . \n                     Ambitious AIDS grants deepen rift between researchers \n                   \n                     News Feature: One for the money \n                   \n                     AIDS special \n                   \n                     Gates Foundation on HIV/AIDS \n                   \n                     Global HIV Vaccine Enterprise \n                   \n                     CHAVI \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Its parts have been dismembered, its roof is leaking, and a wall is missing. Now activists and scientists are squabbling over whether to completely raze the Bevatron \u2014 one of the most important particle accelerators ever built. The remains of the Bevatron, which was decommissioned more than a decade ago, take up prime real estate on the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory's campus in Berkeley, California. Scientists at the lab want to tear it down to make way for fresh projects. But locals, many of whom oppose the demolition because of concerns about the possible release of contaminants, say they want to see it made into a museum. On 3 August, the city council's Landmarks and Preservation Commission dealt a blow to those wanting landmark status for the accelerator by voting to recognize the Bevatron's legacy without protecting the building. Nevertheless, landmark advocates have vowed to continue fighting. \u201cIt's truly a landmark, a very unique building,\u201d says Mark McDonald, who sits on the City of Berkeley's Peace and Justice Commission. \u201cSomebody called it the world's largest yurt.\u201d The Bevatron, which from above looks not unlike a traditional Mongolian tent, began its life in 1954, smashing protons into a fixed target. A year after it opened for operation, physicists Emilio Segr\u00e8 and Owen Chamberlain used it to discover the antiproton (see ' Bevatron's greatest hits '), for which they were awarded the Nobel prize in 1959. Over the next 40 years, other scientists used the Bevatron to study the violation of particle symmetry, as well as particle resonances, a phenomenon that eventually led to the quark model of matter. But the machine had trouble keeping up in the fast-moving world of high-energy particle physics. Attempts to improve it were constrained by space restrictions \u2014 caused by the Berkeley Laboratory's placement on a steep hillside and close proximity to the city of Berkeley below. Over time it was gradually eclipsed by larger accelerators at other labs. In its last decades of operation, it was used to conduct biological research, including assessing the radiation risks associated with space flight. It was eventually shut down in 1993 due to budget shortfalls. Since then, it has been taking up precious space on the Berkeley Lab's relatively small campus, according to Benedict Feinberg, a physicist there who served as the Bevatron's director for 1989\u201393. The laboratory recently got the $90 million needed to remove the machine, and is currently pursuing its demolition. \u201cThe value of the Bevatron is for the science that was done there,\u201d says Feinberg. \u201cThe building is nothing really special.\u201d Feinberg declined to comment on the latest interest in preserving the building, but some lab officials quietly believe that it's the walls, not the accelerator, that are of real concern to local groups. The building was constructed using transite, a composite of asbestos and cement, which releases asbestos fibres when it is broken up. Community members have expressed fears that razing the Bevatron would involve moving large amounts of loose asbestos through the city of Berkeley. Environmentalists also fear that lead and other contaminants from the building site could escape into the water table. Pamela Sihvola, who co-chairs the Committee to Minimize Toxic Waste \u2014 a local watchdog group that monitors the laboratory \u2014 is among those pushing to preserve the Bevatron. \u201cThe EPA says that the best way to deal with lead and asbestos is to manage it in place,\u201d she says. \u201cAll we want the laboratory to do is consider a re-use alternative,\u201d she says. \u201cIt could be a living science museum and education centre.\u201d Chamberlain supported the idea, and even wrote a letter advocating the conversion of the Bevatron before his death in February, she notes. McDonald adds that the centre would immortalize the Berkeley Lab's most famous work. \u201cWe haven't had a lot of Nobel prizes up there lately,\u201d he says. \u201cThere's nothing wrong with paying a tribute.\u201d But Feinberg disagrees. With limited space, he argues, the Bevatron site is more valuable to lab researchers than the ageing machine it contains. \u201cA fitting memorial,\u201d he says, \u201cwould be to re-use that site to do cutting-edge science.\u201d The lab is now preparing the environmental-impact statement needed to proceed with demolition. Sihvola is gearing up for a fresh round of debate with the full city council: \u201cOur attempts to preserve the building will continue,\u201d she vows. \n                     100 and 50 years ago \n                   \n                     History of the Lawrence Berkeley Lab \n                   \n                     The Bevatron Landmark Application \n                   \n                     Lawrence Berkeley Lab Main Site \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

The University of Connecticut Health Center in Farmington has had one since 2004, and it currently represents 125 postdocs. At the University of California, the UAW would act for some 5,800 postdocs. UAW representatives, including graduate students and postdocs at the university, have gone from lab to lab collecting signatures in support of unionizing. The organization filed a petition to represent postdocs on 13 July. This month, some postdocs began a letter-writing campaign withdrawing their support, saying that they hadn't understood what was involved when they signed up.

On that dream date, something really might be in the air. Results from a mouse study may bolster the evidence for human pheromones, the long-debated chemical signals thought to unconsciously sway our behaviour. A team at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, Washington, has identified a class of protein receptor in the lining of mouse noses that may also operate in humans. Researchers know that certain chemicals in mouse urine can alter the social or sexual behaviour of other mice. These chemicals work partly by binding to receptors in a particular structure in the mouse nose, known as the vomeronasal organ. In humans, however, this organ is thought to be defunct and the role of pheromones is hotly debated. Finding such receptors in the lining of the nose, rather the vomeronasal organ, is a more direct parallel with humans. Stephen Liberles and Linda Buck report their finding online this week in  Nature  (S. D. Liberles & L. B. Buck  Nature  doi:10.1038/nature05066; 2006 ). They isolated a group of receptors that can be triggered by at least one known mouse pheromone. Genes encoding this family of receptors are also found in humans. \u201cIt's probably our best bet yet for functional pheromone genes in humans,\u201d says Timothy Holy, a neurobiologist at Washington University in St Louis, Missouri. For their part, Liberles and Buck are cautious about labelling the mouse proteins as pheromone receptors. They have not yet carried out a key test to show that activating or eliminating the receptors alters a mouse's behaviour. But Buck says that her team is \u201cintrigued by the possibility\u201d of their being pheromone receptors, and is embarking on tests to find out. So far, most evidence for human pheromones has come from behavioural research. In one study, scientists at the University of Chicago showed that women's menstrual cycles changed in length after they sniffed the sweat on pads previously worn in the armpits of another woman (K. Stern & M. K. McClintock  Nature   392 , 177\u2013179; 1998). Another study showed that newborn babies move towards a pad carrying the smell of their mother's breast rather than a clean pad (H. Varendi & R. H. Porter  Acta Paediatr.   90,  372\u2013375; 2001). But many researchers remain sceptical about the power of human pheromones \u2014 or even whether they exist at all. Human behaviour is influenced by so many conscious and unconscious factors that it's hard to measure the subtle changes in behaviour caused by a putative pheromone. \u201cWork on human pheromones seems always to capture both public interest and scientific scepticism,\u201d says Holy. If the receptors discovered in mice are indeed pheromone receptors, this could allow researchers to ask concrete questions about human pheromones. Scientists could, for instance, study people with mutant versions of the receptors to see if they behave differently when exposed to candidate pheromones. The latest study \u201cmakes it harder for the sceptics\u201d, says Martha McClintock, who led the University of Chicago experiments. \u201cHopefully, this will catalyse a lot of research by high-powered scientists.\u201d Neuroscientists already know that genes in neurons in the lining of the nose make more than 1,000 different olfactory receptors for identifying chemical odours. The discovery of this gene family won Buck and Richard Axel the 2004 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. To look for other classes of receptor, Liberles and Buck isolated neurons from mouse noses and searched for genes that were active only in those cells and were similar to olfactory receptors. They hit on a family of 15 such receptors, called trace amine-associated receptors, or TAARs. There are six genes that code for similar receptors in humans. The researchers next searched through a set of other chemicals to find those that activated the TAAR receptors. Three of the chemicals they found are present in mouse urine, which is known to affect the animals' social behaviour. One in particular earns the label of a pheromone because it is produced in the urine of male mice and accelerates the onset of puberty in females. Experts say there may be other as yet undiscovered sensory receptors involved in detecting mammalian pheromones, perhaps including human ones. A paper in 2000 showed that a gene for one mouse pheromone receptor in the vomeronasal organ is also active in the human nose (I. Rodriguez  et al .  Nature Genet.   26,  18\u201319; 2000). \u201cThere might be other unidentified ones out there,\u201d says neurobiologist Frank Zufall of the University of Maryland in Baltimore. Liberles and Buck are now testing whether there are molecules in human urine, sweat and vaginal fluid that can trigger the receptors and that mig ht be human pheromones. They also want to examine whether the neurons manufacturing the newfound receptors are wired up in the brain in a different way from regular, smell-detecting neurons. If so, they might connect to centres that control our behaviour or emotions. \n                     Male mice signal sex with tears \n                   \n                     Ovulating women favour dominant men's smell \n                   \n                     Neuroscience: The sweet smell of success \n                   \n                     Male sweat relaxes women \n                   \n                     Animal attraction seen in action \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

The environment has been caught in the crossfire between Israel and Lebanon. So far, 15,000 tonnes of fuel oil has leaked into the Mediterranean Sea from Lebanon's bombed Jiyyeh power plant, 30 kilometres south of Beirut. With more than 100 kilometres of the Lebanese coastline, and 10 to 20 kilometres of Syria's coast now affected, biologists are scrambling to try to assess how much damage the Lebanese spill could do, and how best to contain it. \u201cEvery oil spill is different,\u201d says Robin Crump, a marine biologist who was involved in the clean-up operations after a 1996 spill off the coast of Wales. \u201cEverything depends on the type of oil, the temperature of the water and the air, the intertidal regions.\u201d Satellite images show that most of the fuel oil leaked by the Jiyyeh plant has been pushed to the Lebanese shore by southwesterly winds; the lack of wave action in the Mediterranean has meant the slick has not been broken up. Although thick oil such as Jiyyeh's is less immediately toxic to wildlife, it can cause problems in the long term. It can pick up sand and sediment from beaches and the mix can then be carried offshore and sink, spreading the oil over a wider area. Warm temperatures can also bake it into a biologically inert crust, like tarmac, that protects the fresher oil underneath from breakdown by bacteria. Although the Lebanese government has received international aid in the form of floating barriers and barrels of detergent to help combat the slick, clean-up has not yet begun. Part of the problem is that no emergency experts from outside the country have been granted security clearance to conduct an impact assessment. And even if experts are given access, the conflict will make it hard to recruit locals to help clean the beaches, observers say. An untreated spill can cause lasting harm, says Jacqueline Michel, president of Research Planning, an environmental-management firm based in Columbia, South Carolina. During the first Gulf War in the early 1990s, oilfields were sabotaged and some 1.5 million tonnes of crude oil spilled into the Persian Gulf. Most of it ended up on the Saudi Arabian coastline, and only around 10% was ever recovered. Today, Michel says, \u201cthe intertidal communities have shown little or no recovery\u201d. In Lebanon, the failure to mount a swift clean-up operation could most harm the region's threatened leatherback, loggerhead and green turtles. Bluefin tuna may also be at risk depending on where the oil goes, adds Luisa Colasimone of the United Nations Environment Programme. The eastern Mediterranean is home to a large spawning ground for the tuna. Environmental damage can occur even after a hasty clean-up, says Charles Peterson, a marine ecologist at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. He and his colleagues have studied the long-term effects of an oil slick spilled when the Exxon Valdez tanker ran aground in Alaska's Prince William Sound in 1989. In 2003 they reported that the recovery of whale, otter and duck populations at the site of the spill has been slower than expected owing to indirect effects of oil contamination (C. H. Peterson  et al .  Science   302,  2082\u20132086; 2003). And a spill along the eastern coast of Panama caused extensive damage to the region's mangroves, despite efforts to minimize the impact of the slick. On the other hand, some areas affected by spills bounce back relatively quickly. The 1996 spill off Wales is a case in point. \u201cTen years on, the system has recovered,\u201d Crump says. \n                 With additional reporting by Michael Hopkin \n               \n                     Oil-drenched birds get dry cleaned \n                   \n                     How to clean a beach \n                   \n                     Prestige: one month on \n                   \n                     Uncertainty shrouds \n                   \n                     UN Environment Programme \n                   \n                     Regional Marine Pollution Emergency Response Centre for the Mediterranean Sea \n                   \n                     Centre for Documentation, Research and Experiments on Accidental Water Pollution. \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Nature  has learned that very few \u2014 if any \u2014 avian flu samples from Indonesian birds have been sent to official labs for sequencing over the past year. The data blackout comes just as surveys of the country are revealing a startling number of previously unrecognized avian outbreaks. \"We have had no sequence data from poultry viruses for Indonesia for almost a year, since last August,\" says Peter Roeder, a consultant for the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) in Indonesia. \"It just happened; no one was sending any samples,\" he says. Experts say that without thorough genetic sequencing of bird viruses from the area it is difficult to tell whether the virus is mutating, or how the human cases correspond to birds in the area. There have been some human viruses found in Java that so far have no obvious avian counterparts: perhaps simply because matching strains in birds have not been sequenced, or perhaps not.  \n              Good news? \n            Only now has a batch of such samples finally arrived at the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) reference library in Geelong, Australia. \"Good news: more than 100 animal isolates ready to go,\" reads a report from an international expert consultation on combating H5N1 in Indonesia, held in Jakarta in late June. Some 91 of these samples have now arrived, says Roeder. This activity may have been spurred by the limited human-to-human spread of H5N1 seen within a family in Kubu Sembelang in May this year. Scientists are keen to compare the human viruses with previous avian outbreaks in the area, but no such recent samples have been available. Reporting of poultry results from Indonesia is \"inadequate\", with \"specimens going into a 'black box'\", read the Jakarta meeting documents, adding that \"this lack of information on avian H5N1 viruses requires urgent attention.\" \"Over the next few months there will be quite intensive genetic analysis of the samples,\" says Roeder. \"This is something we really have to get on top of.\"  \n              Under surveillance \n            It has been difficult to organize sampling in Indonesia, Roeder says, with a decentralized system of responsibility for collecting viral material in a country spread over some 6,000 inhabited islands, with many backyard farms. But that seems to be improving. There is an Indonesian government strategic plan, being assisted by the FAO, to create a large, coordinated surveillance and control programme around the country. A pilot scheme involving 12 teams has been running in the area around Jakarta since January this year. The results of that pilot have proven startling. The Jakarta teams alone have discovered an average of 24 previously unknown infected locations a week between January and May. \"The community surveillance system is starting to work,\" says Roeder. \n             Visit our  \n             \n                 newsblog \n               \n              to read and post comments about this story.  \n           \n                   Bird flu in focus \n                 \n                   Avian flu web focus \n                 \n                   Web resources on Connotea \n                 \n                   FAO avian flu site \n                 \n                   WHO avian flu site \n                 Reprints and Permissions"},

In an unprecedented study of African weather patterns, atmospheric scientists from around the world have decamped this summer to the west of the continent. Their goal is to deliver the first truly useful forecasts of the region's violent monsoon storms. If successful, the \u20ac50-million (US$64-million) African Monsoon Multidisciplinary Analysis (AMMA) project will spawn hundreds of research papers and reshape thinking on west Africa's climate. But it should also help west Africans to cope with the destabilizing effects of unpredictable storms. The monsoon rains not only dictate agricultural success or failure, but also bring floods that can damage roads and bridges, and encourage malaria-carrying mosquitoes. If these storms could be predicted weeks or months in advance, people in the region could plan ahead with far greater confidence. \u201cTo have that would be a huge help,\u201d says Lauren Gelfand, who works on development projects for the charity Oxfam in Dakar, Senegal. \u201cThis is one of the driest regions in the world. People rely on one season of rain.\u201d To develop their forecasting tools, AMMA has first had to plug holes in the region's meteorological networks (see  Nature   435 , 862\u2013863; 2005). \u201cThere are precious few observations over the Sahara,\u201d says Doug Parker, an atmospheric physicist at the University of Leeds, who heads the British AMMA team. European funding agencies have already spent around \u20ac2.5 million to upgrade west Africa's weather-balloon capability, particularly in five of the countries most involved in the project: Niger, Benin, Burkina Faso, Mali and Senegal. But this August's push is the heaviest data-gathering period planned in the roughly decade-long AMMAproject, which began in 2002. Last week, Parker said his team were still recovering from a series of bumpy four-hour data-collection flights around west African storms, which are some of the most intense on the planet. His group will team up with four other aircraft to fly coordinated missions until 21 August. British and French teams plan to drop curtains of radiosondes \u2014 meteorological devices that record and transmit data on temperature and pressure \u2014 in front of and behind storms. German and French teams using converted executive jets may fly right through the middle of the storms, at heights of around 15 kilometres. A former spy plane operated by Russian researchers will monitor the storms from above, at heights of around 25 kilometres. Researchers hope that the flights will help them to understand the generation and movement of thunderstorms. The data gathered should also allow modellers to refine their predictions of everything from daily weather forecasts to long-term climate change. But the most useful result for local people will be more accurate rainfall forecasts, says Thierry Lebel, a member of the French AMMA team at the Grenoble Institute of Technology. At the start of the monsoon, for example, early rainfall can be followed by weeks of drought that can kill young plants, as Gelfand says has happened this year. If such events could be predicted, farmers could be warned to delay planting. Results from AMMA could also help much farther away. Some 550 kilometres west of Senegal, a US team based in the Cape Verde Islands in the Atlantic Ocean will complement the European operations. The researchers will make 10 to 12 flights on a DC-8 aircraft owned by NASA, gathering data on cloud particles, wind speed and direction, rainfall rates and more. They hope to help understand how the Atlantic hurricanes that strike North America form, something that one team member, hurricane consultant Jeff Halverson, formerly of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, calls \u201cone of the great unsolved mysteries of atmospheric science\u201d. Monsoon storms can develop into hurricanes off the west African coast, if the right factors are present. But not all do: even given those factors only 10% of storms become hurricanes, and researchers struggle to predict which ones could go on to devastate the US east coast.

But this year rumours have an extra dimension: one of the prizes to be awarded at the International Congress of Mathematicians in Madrid on 22 August may be given for the solution of a century-old problem. Favourite to win a medal is Russian mathematician Grigory 'Grisha' Perelman, for his work on the Poincar\u00e9 conjecture. Three papers now suggest that his proof of the conjecture is right. If it stands up to two years of scrutiny, Perelman will also be eligible for at least a share of a million-dollar mathematics prize (see ' Clay feats: the million dollar quastions '). \u201cI am completely convinced that Perelman has proved the Poincar\u00e9 conjecture,\u201d says John Morgan, a topologist at Columbia University in New York and co-author of the most recent paper analysing Perelman's work. The Poincar\u00e9 conjecture is a seemingly simple statement about the nature of three-dimensional surfaces, but it had resisted proof since French mathematician Henri Poincar\u00e9 put it forward in 1904. In 2002, Perelman posted to an online preprint server a paper 1  that claimed to \u201cgive a sketch of an eclectic proof of this conjecture\u201d. By this, Perelman meant not just the Poincar\u00e9 conjecture, but the geometrization conjecture, a much broader theorem of which Poincar\u00e9's statement is a special case. The geometrization conjecture classifies all the possible forms that three-dimensional surfaces, called three-manifolds, can take. The Poincar\u00e9 conjecture describes the properties of a subset known as 'simply connected' manifolds \u2014 in particular, those for which every loop drawn on the surface can be shrunk to a point. To tackle the conjecture, Perelman used a mathematical tool known as Ricci flow, developed by Richard Hamilton of Columbia University. Perelman, formerly of the Steklov Institute in Moscow, advanced Hamilton's work by finding a way to deal with certain problems encountered in using Ricci flow to study the deformation of surfaces. The advent of a possible proof shook a small contingent of mathematicians. \u201cFor people studying topology, the whole landscape has changed. It's like waking up one morning after an earthquake,\u201d says Bruce Kleiner of Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut. Perelman followed his first article with two further papers, and in the spring of 2003 he toured the United States to lecture about his work 2 . He has since retreated from the public eye, leaving other mathematicians to comb through his papers line by line, filling in details and searching for holes in his logic. \u201cHow do you decide whether anything is correct?\u201d asks John Ball, president of the International Mathematical Union and chair of the Fields medal committee. \u201cAll that can happen is that clever people, experts in the area, read it and come to an opinion.\u201d Three pairs of respected mathematicians have produced written accounts filling in the details of Perelman's work. Kleiner and John Lott of the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, posted their most recent paper to the arXiv preprint server on 25 May 3 . \u201cThere was a moment when I really thought there was a problem with the argument,\u201d says Kleiner. \u201cBut that state of mind persisted for only a week or two before the issue was resolved.\u201d A 473-page paper 4  by Morgan and Gang Tian of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology appeared on 25 July. The third paper, from Huai-Dong Cao of Lehigh University in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, and Xi-Ping Zhu of Zhongshan University in Guangzhou, China, was published in June 5 . It claims to complete the proof of both conjectures, rather than simply fleshing out Perelman's work. This is justified, argues Shing-Tung Yau, an editor-in-chief on the journal, because Cao and Zhu follow a somewhat different argument to Perelman. The appearance of these three papers has fuelled rumours that Perelman will receive a Fields prize. Up to four medals are awarded every four years to mathematicians no older than 40, making Perelman just eligible for this year's crop. Not that he will attend the Madrid meeting: the organizing committee received no reply when they invited him to give a plenary lecture. Even so, many mathematicians think Perelman will be honoured with a medal. \u201cI hope that they give him one. This is such a major achievement in mathematics, it would be funny if they didn't,\u201d says Morgan. There is also a precedent. Two previous Fields medals have been awarded for proofs of an equivalent of the Poincar\u00e9 conjecture in higher dimensions \u2014 to Stephen Smale in 1966 and Michael Freedman in 1986. And in 2006? Morgan, along with 4,000 guests, will find out in a few weeks \u2014 when the medals are announced at the opening ceremony of the congress in Madrid. \n                     Dramatizing maths: What's the plot? \n                   \n                     Mathematics: The reluctant celebrity \n                   \n                     Mathematics: Conjuring with conjectures \n                   \n                     Wikipedia on the Poincar\u00e9 conjecture \n                   \n                     Wikipedia on the geometrization conjecture \n                   \n                     Clay Mathematics Institute \n                   \n                     International Congress of Mathematicians 2006 \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

The Singaporean government is known for its generosity in pumping money into international research projects. But it can apparently be ruthless if these projects do not please it. The city-state is shutting down a medical research arm of Johns Hopkins University in Singapore, claiming it has not delivered as planned. The decision has sent shock waves through other universities and research institutes, some of which are in the initial stages of collaborating with Singapore. On 20 June, the 60 faculty members and staff of the Division of Biomedical Sciences, Johns Hopkins Medicine in Singapore, were given official notice that as of 1June 2006, the facility was being wound down. The process will take 12 months, with researchers and staff receiving salaries until the facility closes on 31 May 2007. \u201cWe thought it unwise to continue putting money into something that is not working,\u201d says Andre Wan, director of the Biomedical Research Council at the Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A * STAR). He claims that Johns Hopkins failed to meet key requirements in its contract. The split is the first major failure of Singapore's recent push into biomedical research, which includes building the ambitious Biopolis research centre. Singapore and Johns Hopkins Medicine first got together in 1998, to set up Johns Hopkins Singapore as the university's base for medical research, education and clinical studies in southeast Asia. In 2003, the two parties restructured the organization, making it the first full division of Johns Hopkins Medicine outside its US home in Baltimore, Maryland. Under the five-year contract begun in February 2004, A * STAR agreed to provide S$75 million (US$47.5 million) to cover salaries, facilities and research equipment. For its part, according to A * STAR, Johns Hopkins aimed to build a centre of immunology, experimental therapeutics and cancer research, to establish a PhD programme and to bring senior researchers with international reputations to Singapore. Wan alleges that Johns Hopkins has failed to meet 8 out of 13 key performance indicators in the past two years. For example, it agreed to hire at least 12 full-time senior researchers with residence in Singapore by the end of the second year. So far, Wan says it has hired seven, only one of whom fulfils all the requirements. Gary Stephenson, a spokesman for Johns Hopkins Medicine, declined to comment, saying the university plans to issue a joint statement with A * STAR soon. But on 22 July, a Singaporean newspaper reported a Johns Hopkins official as alleging that Singapore failed to meet its financial and educational obligations under the agreement; A * STAR denies those claims. The break-up has reminded other universities not to take their collaborative projects with Singapore for granted. For instance, in 2005 Duke University School of Medicine in Durham, North Carolina, established a graduate medical school with the National University of Singapore, as part of a seven-year contract. \u201cThe major lesson I'm taking from this is to seek great clarity of how performance in our exciting new venture will be defined,\u201d says Sanders Williams, founding dean of the new school. \n                     City state hopes research cash will buy global status \n                   \n                     The changing face of China \n                   \n                     Singapore: An irresistible force \n                   \n                     Building a biopolis \n                   \n                     Johns Hopkins in Singapore \n                   \n                     A * STAR \n                   \n                     Duke-NUS Graduate Medical School Singapore \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

It's pretty standard to find syntheses in a chemistry journal. But a paper published online last week by the international edition of  Angewandte Chemie  has got the world of organic chemistry humming. It is the second time this year that the journal has published a complete synthesis for a molecule called hexacyclinol \u2014 yet each paper claims a different structure for its final product. Hexacyclinol is extracted from a mushroom and has some medical potential. The first synthesis of the molecule was published in February by chemist James La Clair of the Xenobe Research Institute in San Diego (J. J. La Clair  Angew. Chem. Int. Ed.   45,  2769\u20132773; 2006). But La Clair's work raised a few eyebrows. For instance, he said his 37-step synthesis made 3.6 grams of hexacyclinol. \u201cI've never heard of a synthesis of that length producing that much material,\u201d says Larry Overman, an organic chemist at the University of California, Irvine. \u201cThere was quite a bit \u2014 a lot \u2014 of scepticism in the community.\u201d The sceptics included Scott Rychnovsky, also of Irvine. La Clair claimed that the structure of his compound matched a prediction made in 2002. But Rychnovsky worked out that hexacyclinol should resemble another mushroom compound, panepophenanthrin. Rychnovsky teamed up with John Porco of Boston University, who came up with a new synthesis (J. A. Porco Jr  et al .  Angew. Chem. Int. Ed.  doi:10.1002/anie.200602854; 2006). The nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrum for the product matched the 2002 data, suggesting the team had made hexacyclinol. And the crystal structure confirmed their new prediction about its structure. Which leaves chemists wondering how La Clair got results confirming the original \u2014 apparently wrong \u2014 structure. And how such a controversial synthesis made it into a peer-reviewed journal. \u201cI can't see any legitimate explanation for the original work,\u201d says Rychnovsky. La Clair now says that he and Porco may have made two different molecules that happen to have very similar NMR spectra. He has no plans to retract his paper, but has offered to change the name of the compound he says he synthesized. Because La Clair is unaffiliated with an institution other than the privately funded Xenobe, there is no obvious body to investigate what happened. Peter G\u00f6litz, editor of  Angewandte Chemie , says La Clair's paper was recommended by three well-qualified reviewers. He declined to comment on whether the paper will be retracted. But he says he invited Rychnovsky to publish \u201cso that the discussion and clarification can be done at the place where the original paper was published\u201d. \n                     News in brief \n                   \n                     \n                         Angewandte Chemie \n                       \n                   \n                     La Clair's synthesis \n                   \n                     Rychnovsky's structural revision \n                   \n                     Porco and Rychnovsky's synthesis \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Researchers have tried to create a pandemic H5N1 influenza strain \u2014 and failed. Simply mixing genes from an H5N1 bird-flu strain with those from an H3N2 human strain did not result in a strain that was readily transmissible, at least among ferrets. The scientists who conducted the work, at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta, Georgia, say it suggests that the H5N1 virus will require a complex series of genetic changes to evolve into a pandemic strain. \u201cThese data do not mean that H5N1 cannot convert to become transmissible from person to person,\u201d says Julie Gerberding, director of the CDC. \u201cWe are not out of the woods on pandemic preparedness yet.\u201d Others agree, pointing out that there are many ways a pandemic strain could evolve. For instance, strains other than those used in the experiments could get together. \u201cThey need to look at other viruses, because both human and avian flu continue to evolve,\u201d says Frederick Hayden, a flu specialist at the University of Virginia, Charlottesville, who is currently working with the World Health Organization. Since 1997, millions of domestic and wild birds have died owing to the H5N1 strain of flu. It has infected at least 232 people and killed 134 of them. Scientists are worried that H5N1 will learn to pass easily between humans and kill millions more. In 1957 and 1968, pandemic strains of flu seem to have emerged when bird and human flu viruses exchanged genes, allowing the bird-flu virus to be easily transmitted between people. To test whether H5N1 might do this, the CDC scientists used a technique called reverse genetics to snip genes out of H3N2 and H5N1 viruses and recombine them into hybrid bird\u2013human viruses. They infected ferrets with the hybrids and tested whether the animals got sick and transferred the viruses to other ferrets (T. R. Maines  et al .  Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA  doi:10/1073/ pnas.0605134103; 2006). Ferrets infected with hybrid viruses did not get as sick as those infected with the original H5N1 virus. In addition, the ferrets did not pass the hybrid virus easily to others. And even if they did pass on the virus, the other ferrets did not become fatally ill. The findings seem to indicate that the recombined viruses were less deadly than the original H5N1 strain and unlikely to transfer to other animals, the scientists say. They hope to repeat the experiments to test the pandemic potential of other viruses \u2014 including those taken from patients after 1997, the year that the H5N1 strain they used was isolated. \u201cWe believe this model is a good tool to assess the potential of H5N1 viruses to cause a pandemic in the future,\u201d says Jacqueline Katz of the CDC, who led the work. Many questions remain unanswered, however. The ferret model may not perfectly replicate human disease, say scientists not involved in the experiments. Nor does the study address whether H5N1 could evolve into a pandemic strain by accumulating mutations if it passed through many people. It also did not test hybrids with human flu viruses other than H3N2. \u201cThe attention being paid to pandemic preparedness is certainly appropriate, and the results shouldn't dissuade people from continuing to progress in that area,\u201d says Hayden. \n                     More cats found with bird flu \n                   \n                     Family tragedy spotlights flu mutations \n                   \n                     Bird flu outbreaks in Indonesia going unstudied \n                   \n                     Bird flu: On border patrol \n                   \n                     More cats found with bird flu \n                   \n                     Pandemic 'dry run' is cause for concern \n                   \n                     Feline friend or potential foe? \n                   \n                     Bird Flu in focus \n                   \n                     Avian flu web focus \n                   \n                     Nature's avian flu mashup in Google Earth \n                   \n                     FAO avian influenza page \n                   \n                     WHO avian influenza page \n                   \n                     Avian influenza in animals \n                   \n                     CDC \n                   \n                     US pandemic preparedness \n                   \n                     Google Earth \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

So when opponents to loosening restrictions on US funding of embryonic stem-cell research took to the Senate floor last week, they were keen to emphasize their support for research that doesn't involve the destruction of embryos (see  pages 329  and  335 ). Some senators exaggerated the promise of adult-derived stem cells, but they have real potential, as do other alternatives to embryonic stem cells. Adult-derived stem cells are the only form of stem-cell therapy to make it to the clinic so far. For example, stem cells from bone marrow (pictured) have been used for more than 30 years to treat blood disorders. Adult stem cells are less likely to cause tumours than embryonic stem cells, and less likely to be rejected by the immune system. But adult stem cells are limited in other ways \u2014 most notably supply. Some adult stem cells can be grown in the lab, but not indefinitely. Isolating sufficient quantities of certain tissues, such as brain samples, could also pose a major technical hurdle. A few scientists are taking a different tack and trying to harvest the potential of embryonic stem cells \u2014 particularly their immortality and flexibility \u2014 without destroying embryos to get them. For example, experiments in mice have shown that a single cell taken from a blastocyst, without destroying it, can be used to derive a cell line. But tampering with human embryos in this way may not address everyone's ethical concerns. \n               Diminishing returns \n             In August 2001, US President George W. Bush restricted federal funding to work on human embryonic stem-cell lines already in existence. Of 64 lines said to be available, some failed in culture and some were retracted by donors, leaving 21 approved lines. But why aren't scientists happy with those? About half of the available lines grow slowly, making them virtually unusable, says Renee Reijo Pera of the University of California, San Francisco. Another problem is that the cell lines have aged in the past five years and accumulated genetic mutations. There are frozen stocks, but many were created using protocols that are outdated, meaning thawed cells can be difficult to culture. Then there are the 'feeder cells' that form the matrix on which stem cells grow. All 21 lines were cultured using feeder cells from mice, so they may be too contaminated for use in humans. There are also unexplained differences in how cell lines behave \u2014 for example, some differentiate more easily into certain cell types than others. And researchers can't use disease-specific cell lines, which come from embryos with conditions such as cystic fibrosis: the Reproductive Genetics Institute in Chicago claims to have derived 36 such lines, but not one is approved for federally funded research. \n               Sweden steams ahead \n             At least 55 human embryonic stem-cell lines have been derived in Sweden: 30 at Cellartis in Gothenburg and 25 at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm. Do scientists really need so many lines to choose from? \u201cWell, they're not all quite the same,\u201d says Outi Hovatta of the Karolinska Institute. \u201cWe've found that around 1,000 of the 30,000 genes we have checked in our cell lines are expressed differently.\u201d Each cell line has characteristics of its own, she says. All have the basic ability to grow in culture and to transform into different cell types. But some grow faster than others, and some are more stable in long-term culture. \u201cSome differentiate more easily into particular tissues,\u201d adds Hovatta. \u201cMany lines differentiate very nicely into nerve cells, for example, while others can turn into pancreatic cells, which are always rather tricky. \n               Europe's framework funding \n             A major research collaboration dedicated to human embryonic stem cells and funded by Europe's Sixth Framework Programme (FP6) kicks off next month. The project, ESTOOLS, got \u20ac12 million (US$15 million) from FP6, which has been matched by the collaboration, comprising 20 labs in 10 different countries. The project will study how stem cells differentiate into neurons, and will fully characterize 52 human lines. Several FP6 programmes on specific disorders and 11 new projects have just received ethical approval for work on human embryonic stem cells (pictured). And this week EU ministers agreed to continue funding in FP7. \n               Estimates from China \n             At least six laboratories in China are thought to have succeeded in deriving human embryonic stem-cell lines. Government funding for such research has significantly increased in the past five years, but there are no proper guidelines, and it is hard to monitor achievements. \u201cThere's a lot going on that you don't really know about,\u201d says Jack Price of King's College London, who led a stem-cell team to China in 2004. Estimates of the number of Chinese lines range from 10 to almost 70. Lingsong Li, who heads the Peking University Stem Cell Research Center, is cautious. He says that based on published evidence the most likely figure is \u201cmore than 10, but less than 15\u201d. \n               Clinical trials in sight \n             A big problem with the early human embryonic stem-cell lines is that they were not designed to be safe for use in humans. This week, Singapore-based biotech company ESI announced that it has derived four safe lines (produced in Australia) \u2014 with four more in the pipeline. It will make them available to researchers worldwide. Regulatory agencies have not yet said what standards cell lines would need to meet to be used in humans. But academic and biotech groups are gearing up to generate lines that satisfy Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP), a system for pharmaceutical products. Facilities that can derive and bank GMP lines are being built around the world. It may also be possible to elevate existing lines to GMP status. The main problem with older lines is that they have been cultured with animal products. But Geron, based in Menlo Park, California, claims to have derived clinical-grade cells using two US-approved lines that were initially cultured using mouse cells. The company will apply for approval to start US clinical trials in 2007, using glial cells derived from human embryonic stem cells to treat spinal injuries. \n                 Information compiled by Alison Abbott, Carina Dennis, Heidi Ledford and Kerri Smith. \n               \n                     A long week in stem-cell politics... \n                   \n                     Come veto or high water \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

See also ' The lure of stem cell lines '  Just days after US President George W. Bush vetoed a bill that would have significantly broadened federal funding for human embryonic stem-cell research, European Union ministers have given the green light to funding guidelines similar to the US proposal. In a cliffhanger decision on 24 July, the EU council agreed to the inclusion of ethically approved human embryonic stem-cell research in its next round of research funding. The \u20ac50-billion (US$63-billion) seventh Framework Programme for research (FP7) is due to start in January 2007, and runs until 2013. But the council will not directly finance the destruction of human embryos. So researchers cannot use FP7 funding to derive their own cell lines from embryos left over from  in vitro  fertilization procedures, as can be done with national funding in the United Kingdom and Sweden. They must instead buy them from other sources. The UK Royal Society expressed \u201cdisappointment\u201d at the restriction. But others are happier. \u201cI think this is an OK decision given this is Europe and we have to find compromise,\u201d says Elena Cattaneo, a stem-cell researcher at the University of Milan in Italy. Approval of most aspects of the research programme require a qualified majority vote, and there was much horse-trading as countries with restrictive stem-cell laws, particularly Germany, tried to set up a 'blocking minority' of countries. These apparently failed, but only at the last minute. Austin Smith, incoming chair of the Institute forStem Cell Biology in Cambridge, UK, says the issue is seen as broader than just stem cells. \u201cThe whole of science is under attack with the sorts of statements George Bush has been making, and with Germany trying to impose its own moral and cultural view over the entirety of European research,\u201d he says. \u201cThese fundamentalist positions refuse to see the benefits of science \u2014 it's like going back to the days of Galileo and the Church. There has been a huge sigh of relief in the research community in Europe this week.\u201d Across the Atlantic, researchers had no such reprieve, as Bush exercised the first veto of his almost six-year presidency on 19 July. \u201cThis bill would support the taking of innocent human life in the hope of finding medical benefits for others. It crosses a moral boundary that our decent society needs to respect, so I vetoed it,\u201d Bush declared at a White House gathering that included babies 'adopted' as frozen embryos left over at fertility clinics. The same day, the US House of Representatives attempted to override the veto, but failed to muster the two-thirds majority needed. The veto prompted Republican Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger of California to announce a $150-million loan the next day to jump-start that state's $3-billion stem-cell research programme, which has been stalled by legal wrangling. \u201cWe cannot fall behind the nations that make this life-saving science a priority,\u201d says Schwarzenegger. The vetoed bill, which passed the US Senate on a vote of 63 to 37 the day before Bush's action, would have allowed federal funding for research on stem cells derived from embryos left over at fertility clinics and already slated for destruction. As in the European agreement, it would not have allowed funds to be used to derive cell lines from such embryos. Current law forbids US funding of all embryonic stem-cell research, except on 21 lines derived before 9 August 2001. Supporters have vowed to resurrect the legislation. \u201cWhether it's this year, or with a new Senate and a new House and the next president, this will become the law of the United States,\u201d Senator Charles Schumer (Democrat, New York) told a Capitol Hill rally. Observers and research advocates say Bush's action could cost Republicans politically in a country where polls show that at least 60% of the public support the research. \u201cIt's a very risky strategy for Bush,\u201d says leading US pollster John Zogby. \u201cIt makes him and the Republicans appear to be anti-science.\u201d That the legislation reached the president's desk at all in a Congress with both houses controlled by conservative Republicans speaks to the broad reach of diseases, from juvenile diabetes to Parkinson's, for which the research holds promise. It is also testimony to the strength of the Coalition for the Advancement of Medical Research (CAMR), an umbrella group of disease and research advocacy groups that lobbied relentlessly for the bill. \u201cThere's never been a group strong enough to push back against the pro-life lobby in Congress. And this group did that,\u201d notes Arthur Caplan, director of the Center for Bioethics at the University of Pennsylvania. The coalition now says it hopes to use the failed bill to tip the balance in November's close-run elections for Congress. \u201cWe're going to do all we can to make this a campaign issue,\u201d says Tony Mazzaschi of the Association of American Medical Colleges, a member of the CAMR. \n                     A long week in stem-cell politics... \n                   \n                     Come veto or high water \n                   \n                     Election fever inflames the US stem-cell debate \n                   \n                     Senator boosts chances of stem-cell reform \n                   \n                     Stem cells in focus \n                   \n                     Stem cells Insight \n                   \n                     Stem cells podcast \n                   \n                     25 years of embryonic stem cells web focus \n                   \n                     Making stem cells web focus \n                   \n                     Bush's veto speech July 19 \n                   \n                     Gov.

It sounds like a triumph for the doctrine that people should think globally but act locally \u2014 and like a nightmare scenario for libertarian opponents of big government. Last week, UK environment secretary David Miliband suggested issuing all British adults with an annual carbon allowance. Advocates say the system is fair and would focus people's attention on conserving energy. But could it ever succeed? Here is how the system would work. For transactions that involve direct purchases of energy, such as buying petrol or paying fuel bills, a person would hand over money and some of the carbon credits he or she had been allocated by government. If those credits ran out, the person would have to buy extra when paying for the fuel or electricity. By regulating the amount of personal credits handed out each year, the government could cap total carbon emissions and help tackle climate change. \u201cInstead of banning particular products, services or activities \u2014 or taxing them heavily \u2014 a personal carbon allowance enables citizens to make trade-offs,\u201d said Miliband as he floated the idea on 19 July. Civil servants will look into the proposal and report back to government next year. Researchers who have studied the idea say domestic quotas are a sensible way to extend emissions trading to the personal level \u2014 such trading is already used to limit emissions from some European industries. And unlike a blanket carbon tax, it encourages individuals to think about their emissions. \u201cIt makes carbon more visible,\u201d says Richard Starkey, a carbon-policy expert at the University of Manchester, UK. Starkey also points out that low-income families, which tend to use less energy than higher earners, could save and then sell carbon credits. At current UK emission levels, he reckons each individual would receive around 1.25 tonnes of carbon. For an idea of scale, a 200-km journey in a car that uses petrol would use about 1% of that. The allowance would be worth only a few tens of pounds (or US dollars) at today's prices, but if policies are enacted to meet the ambitious UK target of reducing emissions to 60% below 1990 levels by 2050, that would rise significantly. Such ideas are going down rather less well in the United States, where environmental activists privately hope the UK proposal will attract as little attention as possible. Oil-industry groups have previously claimed that attempts to tackle climate change such as the Kyoto Protocol will damage lifestyles \u2014 an accusation that most politicians, particularly in the United States, are careful to avoid. Personal carbon credits may sound too much like energy rationing. \u201cIt would be awfully hard to explain this to Americans,\u201d says one senior US environmental advocate, who asked not to be named. \n                     UK battles stringent limits on emissions \n                   \n                     Europe set for tough debate on curbing aircraft emissions \n                   \n                     Carbon trading grows into new year \n                   \n                     Emissions trading: The carbon game \n                   \n                     Climate change in focus \n                   \n                     Wikipedia on personal carbon trading \n                   \n                     Richard Starkey's research on domestic trading \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Richard Felger, a conservationist who runs the Drylands Institute in Tucson, Arizona, used to stop and share coffee with people he met crossing the desert along the US\u2013Mexico border. Not any more. A couple of summers ago he was robbed at gunpoint in the Sierra Madres by some drug runners. Another time he was almost carjacked. \u201cYou can't tell who's friendly anymore,\u201d he says. Felger and other conservation biologists say that the biologically valuable lands along the border have become a war zone; increasing numbers of migrants and drug-traffickers are travelling north via the desert, which means more Border Patrol agents pursuing them in cars and helicopters. The dangers are making research into how all the activity is affecting the region's endangered wildlife impossible. But researchers warn that proposals to erect hundreds of kilometres of fences and roads to try to stop the illegal crossings will damage many of the fragile species even further. The US\u2013Mexico border is one of the longest policed borders in the world, stretching some 3,200 km. Cutting through the Colorado river delta, it then runs through the Sonoran Desert for much of its western length. The area is a conservation priority because its rich biodiversity is threatened by a declining water supply \u2014 humans use nearly all the water in the Colorado river. It hosts more plant species than any other desert, as well as vulnerable animals including the pronghorn antelope, and species of bat, owl and jaguar. Over the past decade or so, tougher border enforcement at major crossings such as San Diego in California and El Paso in Texas, has squeezed migrants and drug runners out into the desert. That's making life dangerous for local wildlife, and the biologists studying it. \u201cThe Sonoran Desert system can be pretty fragile,\u201d says Kathy Billings, chief ranger of the desert's Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument park. Billings began her job not long after ranger Kris Eggle was shot and killed when on duty in a drug-related pursuit in 2002. Billings describes the illegal trails beaten into the desert by immigrants and smugglers. The desert is spangled with trash \u2014 nappies, toothbrushes, backpacks and water bottles painted black for night walking. In places, \u201cthe smell of human waste is overwhelming\u201d, she says. About a third of the park is now closed to visitors, and researchers must frequently be accompanied by armed guards. \u201cToday these groups are often carrying drugs and are a lot more dangerous,\u201d adds Mark Briggs, a restoration ecologist who has worked with the conservation group the WWF, and Big Bend National Park in Texas. \u201cI've had some fairly frightening experiences. But you go on with your work, and they go on with theirs.\u201d The dangers mean that data on how badly the environment is being damaged are scarce. \u201cIt's a joke to say we can do pygmy-owl surveys with the amount of activity you see down there,\u201d says Jenny Neeley, southwest representative of Defenders of Wildlife. Neely, based in Phoenix, Arizona, is co-author of a report about how illegal immigrants and the Border Patrol hurt wildlife. Peter Morrison, director of the Pacific Biodiversity Institute in Winthrop, Washington, has been able to do some research on the problem. In a survey of the Buenos Aires National Wildlife Refuge, for example, he recorded an average of 4 km of illegal trails per square kilometre of land. Half the trails were found in the habitat of the endangered Pima pineapple cactus. Morrison presented his results last month at the annual meeting of the Society for Conservation Biology in San Jose, California. But he and his colleagues are now avoiding certain areas. \u201cIt's getting a bit scary,\u201d he says. \u201cA lot of people in the field are questioning whether they want to keep doing this work.\u201d This election season, US politicians have focused their attention on the problems at the border. In the past couple of months President George W. Bush has sent thousands of National Guard troops to aid the 9,000-strong Border Patrol. And duelling bills in the House and Senate propose hundreds of kilometres of extra fencing and illuminated roads. \u201cWe are going to see some fencing built, and some roads built,\u201d says Marshal Fitz, director of advocacy for the American Immigration Lawyers Association based in Washington DC. \u201cIt's just a matter of how much and when.\u201d But although conservationists are pleased that attention is being paid to the situation, they are horrified by the influx of troops and the proposed fences. \u201cWhat they are putting up is like a Berlin wall, and the border-control guys are creating roads left and right,\u201d says Briggs. \u201cIt has been a huge setback for the wildlife.\u201d \u201cIt's very important to try to maintain a wildlife-friendly border,\u201d agrees Morrison. \u201cIf we put up a 12- or 25-foot high wall, it stops everything except things that fly from crossing. That would be a real disaster in the long term.\u201d Researchers are particularly worried about the easily spooked migratory Sonoran pronghorn antelope. Fences would fragment the endangered antelope populations into even smaller groups, and the extra stress caused by border-control traffic might push them over the brink. Meanwhile trash piles attract ravens, which might eat threatened tortoises, and all-night lights disrupt bugs, bats and nocturnal cats such as the ocelot and jaguarondi. There is an alternative to solid fences. Last month, Organ Pipe installed a steel rail, one metre off the ground, which stops cars and trucks yet allows wildlife through. Park biologist Tim Tibbets says that since the barrier, funded by the National Park Service, was erected, vehicle traffic has virtually stopped. Other parks and the nearby Tohono O'odham Indian reservation are looking into putting up similar barriers. The Border Patrol is experimenting with vehicle barriers and is currently coordinating a 10-km section, with a view towards extending that to 133 km, along the Arizona border. But there seems to be more political support for the heavy-duty barriers. And many argue that fences alone won't solve the problem \u2014 in terms of immigration or conservation. \u201cI think there is a heavy militaristic hand in the US response to this,\u201d says Briggs. \u201cThere's momentum now towards putting in these large fences... I don't see anyone addressing why immigrants are coming in the first place.\u201d \u201cNo matter what kind of wall we put up we are going to have problems,\u201d says Morrison. \u201cThe fundamental solution will be to reduce the incredible economic disparity between the countries.\u201d In the meantime, Neeley and Defenders of Wildlife contend that the Border Patrol has neglected the environmental impacts of its work, and has not fulfilled its legal responsibilities under the Endangered Species Act. In a statement to  Nature  the Border Patrol said: \u201cOur primary responsibility is to prevent terrorists and their weapons from entering the country... We will continue to move forward and work with other federal agencies to minimize our effects on the environment.\u201d But in an informal conversation, a Border Patrol spokesman said he felt that conservation projects are just not on the agency's radar screen. \u201cThere are owls on the southwest border?\u201d he added. \n                     Conservation biology: The tiger's retreat \n                   \n                     Ecologists seek to turn tide on Colorado River \n                   \n                     The Drylands Institute \n                   \n                     American Immigration Lawyers Association \n                   \n                     Buenos Aires National Wildlife Refuge \n                   \n                     Pacific Biodiversity Institute \n                   \n                     Organ National Pipe National Monument \n                   \n                     Defenders of Wildlife Report \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

The politics of Nigeria's government, known for its corruption and squandering of oil money, could diplomatically be described as hard to predict. But if plans due to be discussed by parliament later this year come to fruition, the nation's research base will undergo a dramatic transformation. With its coffers boosted by oil exports, Nigeria is considering creating a US$5-billion endowment fund for science and technology \u2014 an investment that would generate a research and development budget on a par with many developed nations, and bigger than those of any of its African rivals. President Olusegun Obasanjo only gave his backing to the proposal in May, but a final decision could be taken this year, as the president is thought to be keen to push it through before leaving office next spring. \u201cHe is determined for this to be one of his legacies,\u201d says Folarin Osotimehin, a science policy adviser at the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) in Paris. Osotimehin is one of several experts from UNESCO and other organizations that have been working with Nigeria on the plan. The result is a proposal, expected to go before parliament this autumn, to establish a National Science Foundation based on the US organization of the same name. The foundation would distribute the return on the endowment through peer review of competitive grant schemes, an unusual move for an African nation. Only South Africa uses competition to distribute a significant fraction of its science budget, says Mohamed Hassan, executive director of the Third World Academy of Science in Trieste, Italy, and a member of the board advising Obasanjo. The foundation would also allow Nigeria to break with African tradition by devoting a large sum of public money to research. South Africa, currently the continent's leading science spender, has an annual budget of around $200 million. A 10% return on the Nigerian endowment would give the country $500 million to spend on science every year. Whether the ambitious target of $5 billion can actually be reached remains an open question. Foreign experts working on the plan say they are advising Obasanjo to meet the total from government funds. Thanks to Nigeria's extensive oil deposits and current high oil prices, that might be possible. But Osita Ogbu, chief economic adviser to Obasanjo, says that Nigeria will contribute the bulk of the money and approach foreign governments and donor organizations for the rest. That could prove a challenge, as Nigeria has long been associated with the abuse of state and donor funds. In the Corruption Perception Index, a league table compiled by the Berlin-based lobby group Transparency International, Nigeria is joint sixth from bottom of 159 nations. Oil revenue has been a particular source of controversy, with senior Nigerian government officials repeatedly being accused of siphoning off revenues. But observers say that Nigeria is changing its ways. In 2004, for example, Obasanjo opened up the country's oil accounts to external scrutiny. The books revealed that money had been stolen in the past, but by pledging to keep the accounts open, the government has shown its commitment to preventing future thefts, says Casey Kelso, regional director for Africa at Transparency International. He adds that more than 50 cases of serious financial crime are being processed. \u201cThere have been some hopeful developments,\u201d he concludes. \u201cCorruption is being tackled.\u201d For foreign donors to be convinced about the endowment and its proceeds, Nigeria will have to pledge to publish clear and comprehensive fund accounts, and to ensure that the peer review is handled by respected scientists. Kelso says that donors might also want to see restrictions put on the amount that can be taken out of the endowment every year and a cap on individual grants. Foreign advisers say UNESCO is confident enough about the project to have offered a $200-million loan. The money generated from the endowment is likely to be channelled into areas that Nigeria has already identified as priorities: income-generating fields such agricultural biotechnology, information technology and satellite launch systems. \u201cWe have to see a product at the end of the project,\u201d says Ogbu. \u201cThis will be research geared towards supporting the economy.\u201d Advisers on the project say they will finalize the details over the summer and present the result to parliament in September. Ogbu knows that these final months of Obasanjo's presidency could be the only chance to push through the plan: \u201cIt has to be set up before he leaves.

On his return from a trip to China on 26 May, J. Reece Roth, an emeritus professor of electrical engineering at the University of Tennessee in Knoxville, was greeted at the airport by agents from the Customs Service and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). The authorities photocopied the contents of his wallet and seized his laptop, he says. Earlier that day, they had searched his office and laboratory, and carried away hard drives and notebooks. As  Nature  went to press, Roth had yet to be charged with a crime. \u201cI'm still not sure what I'm being accused of,\u201d he says. \u201cThis is an orwellian experience.\u201d Search warrants seen by  Nature  for Roth's office, laboratory and computer indicate that he is suspected of violating the Armed Export Control Act, a law that prohibits the transfer of military technologies to foreign countries or nationals. Roth came to the University of Tennessee in 1978, where he developed a technique for creating a type of ionized gas, or plasma, in air at room temperature. Since 1994, he has been experimenting with using the plasma to control the flight of aircraft. By ionizing air as it travelled around a wing's surface, Roth created a plasma that could reduce drag dramatically (pictured above); the technique could allow airplanes to take off and land at steeper angles and on shorter runways. In 2000, Roth's work won him a three-year grant of about $500,000 from the Air Force. The technology has also been licensed in part to Atmospheric Glow Technologies (AGT), a small Knoxville firm. In June 2005, AGT received a $750,000 Air Force contract to develop the plasma for use in unmanned aerial vehicles. Then AGT gave Roth a subcontract to further develop his ideas. \n               Foreign affairs \n             Roth arranged to work with a Chinese graduate student who had helped him with earlier research, and contends that officials at the University, AGT executives and Air Force administrators were all aware of the collaboration. \u201cEverybody knew that a Chinese student would be involved, and nobody raised a red flag,\u201d he says. But when, in early May, a newly hired contract manager at the university became aware of the situation, she apparently notified the authorities. The concerns of the law-enforcement officials were exacerbated, it seems, when Roth travelled to the Research Institute of Tsinghua University in Shenzhen and Fudan University in Shanghai in May, to give lectures and assist the translation of a textbook he had authored. Roth says he discussed the plasma technology generally, but didn't mention specific work being carried out by AGT. Everything in his lectures is available through the openly accessible literature, he claims. \n               A price to pay \n             FBI officials declined to comment on the ongoing investigation but Tom Reddoch, director of AGT, confirms that the company has been cooperating with the authorities. Sue Murphy, a spokeswoman for the Air Force Research Laboratory at Wright\u2013Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio, says they too have been contacted. Murphy says that: \u201cThere's no reason to suspect any release of Air Force sensitive material.\u201d So why is Roth being investigated? The Armed Export Control Act requires most researchers undertaking military-funded applied studies to follow a set of rules known as the International Traffic in Arms Regulations, explains Peter Lichtenbaum. Lichtenbaum previously ran export controls at the US Commerce Department, and is now a partner at Steptoe & Johnson, a law firm based in Washington DC. \u201cWith very narrow exceptions, any release of military technology to a foreign national would require a licence.\u201d Licences for cooperation with Chinese nationals are particularly difficult to get, as they require a special presidential waiver. It is possible that Roth's original plasma research would not have been subject to export controls, but once he was working under contract with AGT to develop specific military applications, he may have required a licence and waiver to work with his Chinese graduate student. The maximum penalty for breaching such regulations is a $1-million fine and up to ten years in prison. But Lichtenbaum says that if charged, tried and convicted, Roth would probably face a fine of up to $500,000. This is not the first time that university researchers have come up against US arms export regulations. In 2003, NASA-funded astrophysicists were barred from working on Double Star, a Chinese satellite designed to explore the interaction of the solar wind with Earth's magnetosphere (see  Nature   426 , 375; 200310.1038/426375b ). But it's rare, says Robert Hardy, of the Council of Government Relations, a Washington-based organization representing research universities. \u201cWe are not aware of very many cases where a situation like this has arisen.\u201d Roth maintains that he did not believe such restrictions would apply at his university, which encourages cooperation with foreign researchers. \u201cIt never occurred to me that a small research contract could trump the bedrock policy of non-discrimination,\u201d he says. He hopes the affair can be resolved quickly, saying the seizure of lab materials has brought his research to a halt. \u201cThis whole thing has not helped me, it has not helped the university,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd it has probably not helped this country, either.\u201d \n                     Plague professor gets two years in bioterror case \n                   \n                     US on sidelines as China prepares for satellite launch \n                   \n                     Space researchers protest at 'disruptive' export controls \n                   \n                     AGT \n                   \n                     Roth's Resume \n                   \n                     University of Tennessee's Plasma Industrial Engineering Group \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Welcome to graphene: the flat carbon sheet with revolutionary aspirations. This thinnest possible pencil-lead shaving has already interested theoretical physicists with its electronic properties, and is predicted to edge aside silicon in the microchips of the future. Now it's ready for its first practical application. Carbon exists in many forms: 'buckyballs', diamond, nanotubes and graphite to name a few. In 2004, Andr\u00e9 Geim of the University of Manchester, UK, together with Russian colleagues, created another form \u2014 carbon layers just one atom thick, called graphene (K. S. Novoselov  et al .  Science   306,  666\u2013669; 2004). Physicists have since documented some remarkable properties of this material. But industrial applications have seemed some way off, as graphene has proved difficult to produce on a large scale. It was made by unwieldy methods such as rubbing flecks off a piece of graphite, as Geim did, or boiling up silicon carbide in a vacuum. Now, Rodney Ruoff and his team at Northwestern University, Illinois, have come up with a way to make large amounts of graphene embedded in a polymer matrix. The researchers start with graphite oxide \u2014 graphite with oxygen-containing chemical groups attached. After further chemical modification and treatment with ultrasound, the material separates into layers, and disperses through a solvent in which a polymer such as polystyrene is also dissolved. Chemical reduction removes most of the oxygen groups, and removing the solvent leaves behind graphene sheets crumpled within the solid polymer (see  pages 282  and  254 ). The resulting material is strong, and electrically and thermally conducting. Such properties are similar to those of carbon nanotube composites, which isn't surprising as a sheet of graphene is basically an unrolled nanotube. But the graphene-based composites produced by Ruoff's chemical method are cheaper and more reliable to manufacture, so could be perfect for things that need to be lightweight, strong and conducting, such as aircraft fuselages. Although graphene's first foray into industry is likely to be as a composite, several groups are working on unlocking the potential of the isolated sheets. For one thing, the sheets' electronic properties make graphene a candidate to replace silicon in a fresh era of microchip electronics. \u201cGraphene is quite different from conventional semiconductors such as silicon,\u201d explains Philip Kim, a physicist from Columbia University in New York. Electrons move though silicon in a series of collisions; these generate heat and limit the speed and size of silicon transistors. The density of components on silicon chips has doubled every 18 months or so since the 1960s, a trend known as 'Moore's law' after Intel's co-founder Gordon Moore predicted it in 1965. But many believe silicon chips will soon reach their limit. In graphene, however, electrons shoot along with minimal resistance. This, says Kim, may allow for low-power, faster-switching transistors. \u201cBut it's difficult to turn graphene off, which will make it hard to use in an electrical switch,\u201d he notes. \u201cReally, we need new types of electronic architecture to make best use of graphene.\u201d \n               Trumping silicon \n             Also enthusiastic about graphene's potential in computing is Walt de Heer, of Georgia Tech's School of Physics in Atlanta. His team, with French collaborators at the National Centre of Scientific Research in Grenoble, is attempting to etch electronic structures into layers of graphene wafers grown on silicon carbide. He points out that carbon nanotubes would give the same electronic advantages as graphene sheets but that it is difficult to produce them in large amounts and organize them on a chip, and that high electrical resistances occur when nanotubes are connected with metal wires in an electronic circuit. \u201cNo one sees nanotubes as a serious avenue,\u201d says de Heer. In contrast, flat graphene wafers are easily etched using conventional lithography techniques. De Heer also hopes that connecting wires won't be necessary. He envisages future electronic circuits made up of continuous graphene sheets, saying that cutting graphene into ribbons of different widths controls its conducting properties. De Heer, who along with his team has attracted funding from Intel, is confident in graphene's electronic potential, although he cheerfully predicts that the revolution won't come just yet. \u201cIndustry has no reason to switch over from silicon until the end of Moore's law in 10 or 15 years,\u201d he says. Geim is more wary. \u201cElectronic applications require reliable large-scale production of graphene,\u201d he says. \u201cAt the moment the quality is rather mediocre.\u201d Geim is more excited about graphene's usefulness as a research tool. The carbon lattice in the sheets is extremely regular, giving the electrons within the lattice unusual properties. \u201cThe electrons move collectively in a manner that mimics particle behaviour at close to light speed,\u201d explains Geim. He and other teams are using graphene to investigate quantum mechanical effects previously thought to occur only in dense plasmas around black holes and neutron stars, or in powerful particle accelerators. One example is the Klein paradox, in which fast-moving particles pass straight through a seemingly impenetrable barrier. Meanwhile Ruoff believes his composites might yet trump other applications. By chemically modifying the sheets within the polymer matrix and studying the resulting properties, he hopes to usher in a new class of graphene-based materials. He suggests that chemically tuned composites could be used as electrically conductive plastics in solar panels, for example, or to dissipate excess heat within computer parts: \u201cThe technology wizards will take this in various directions.\u201d One thing researchers agree on is that we're likely to hear a lot more about graphene. \u201cNothing is a sure deal,\u201d says de Heer. \u201cBut nothing is an insurmountable problem.

Embryonic stem-cell researchers in Italy have reacted strongly to comments made by a Catholic cardinal earlier this month that anyone involved in destroying human embryos \u2014 including scientists deriving stem cells for research \u2014 should be excommunicated. Concerned at the press coverage that followed the cardinal's statements, which implied that human embryonic stem-cell research is illegal in Italy, scientists from six different groups held a conference in Rome on 14 July to defend and explain their work. The organizers included Carlo Flamigni of the Institute of Clinical Obstetrics and Gynaecology in Bologna, Maurizio Mori, a bioethicist at the University of Turin, and Elena Cattaneo, a stem-cell researcher at the University of Milan. They also sent an open letter to Italian prime minister Romano Prodi stating that their work is legal under Italian law, and asking the government to actively promote stem-cell work and guarantee the freedom to carry out such research. \u201cFreedom of scientific research is a principle enshrined in our Constitution. We would like reality to reflect that,\u201d the letter says. Cardinal Alfonso L\u00f3pez Trujillo ignited controversy when he became the first top Vatican official to publicly support excommunication of those involved in destroying embryos to derive stem cells for research. The comments by Trujillo, who heads the Vatican's Pontifical Council for the Family, were published in Italy's leading Catholic magazine  Famiglia Cristiana  on 2 July. The Catholic Church opposes the destruction of embryos for any purpose, as it believes that life begins at conception. The researchers behind the Italian protest say they are worried that such comments could affect political support for embryonic stem-cell research in their strongly Catholic country. Italy already has some of the world's most restrictive laws regarding embryo research, and does not allow embryos to be created or destroyed for research purposes. However, researchers are allowed to work on imported embryonic stem-cell lines. Cattaneo, one of the organizers of the Rome conference and a Catholic herself, says she fears further restrictions and funding cuts for the already small number of Italian groups working on embryonic stem cells. \u201cWe will remain dependent on science done abroad,\u201d she says. \u201cIn the future, I'm not sure this will entitle our country to benefit from such research.\u201d Luca Gianaroli, scientific director of the SISMER reproductive-medicine unit in Bologna, agrees that the Vatican has a powerful influence over Italian politicians. Italy's current stem-cell law, approved by parliament in 2004, was what the Vatican wanted, he says. \u201cIt was drafted by the Church.\u201d But he doesn't believe Trujillo's comments will trigger further cuts: \u201cIt's like adding water to an already full glass.\u201d Trujillo may also have hoped to influence politicians beyond Italy \u2014 his comments have come as politicians in both the United States and the European Union debate the use of public funds for embryonic stem-cell research. A blocking minority of countries threatens to overturn the European Parliament's decision to include such work in its latest round of research funding. And as  Nature  went to press, the US Senate was preparing to vote on a bill that would loosen restrictions on federal funding for embryonic stem-cell research. How much influence the statement will have is likely to depend on whether Pope Benedict XVI, whose words carry far more power than those of a cardinal, feels the same way. Since Trujillo's comments, the Vatican has remained silent on the issue. It has not voiced support for Trujillo's stand, but \u2014 perhaps more importantly \u2014 nor has it said that Trujillo was speaking personally and not for the Church leadership. \n                     Cardinal condemns stem-cell researchers \n                   \n                     Saving Italian science \n                   \n                     Pope urged to reflect on condom use \n                   \n                     Conclave kindles hope for bioethical reform \n                   \n                     Stem cells in focus \n                   \n                     Stem cells Insight \n                   \n                     Stem cells podcast \n                   \n                     25 years of embryonic stem cells web focus \n                   \n                     Medical research news channel \n                   \n                     European Consortium for Stem Cell Research \n                   \n                     John Allen \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

As a way to resolve a scientific dispute, it was always likely to be fraught. In March 2005, nuclear engineer Rusi Taleyarkhan of Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana \u2014 known for his controversial claims to have achieved 'bubble fusion' \u2014 formally joined forces with one of his most prominent critics, physicist Seth Putterman of the University of California, Los Angeles. But few could have predicted that this collaboration would end in such disarray. After concerns about Taleyarkhan's work were reported in  Nature  earlier this year 1 , Purdue carried out an inquiry, but has shrouded the results in confidentiality, a decision that has frustrated other researchers in the field. The findings could resolve the long-standing controversy surrounding bubble fusion, but whether they will ever be made public now seems to rest on a technicality: did $250,000 of US taxpayers' money help fund the disputed work? The story began in 2002, when Taleyarkhan reported fusion in collapsing bubbles within a liquid, an effect also called sonofusion 2 . His work made headlines worldwide: if the effect could be harnessed, it would promise almost unlimited energy. But others in the field were not convinced. In the hope of settling the resulting argument, in March 2005 DARPA, the Pentagon's research agency, paid Taleyarkhan and his critics to work together to replicate the bubble-fusion experiment. Putterman was principal investigator on the $812,000 grant and so has to account for all the expenditure. Taleyarkhan was allocated $318,000 of the grant, and Ken Suslick of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign was given $145,000. It was clear things weren't going well when concerns about the validity of Taleyarkhan's bubble-fusion work were reported on 8 March 1 . These included an analysis by Putterman's postdoc, Brian Naranjo 3 , showing that the neutrons described in Taleyarkhan's latest paper, published in  Physical Review Letters  ( PRL ) in January 4 , came not from fusion as claimed but from the radioactive decay of standard lab material. Purdue's provost Sally Mason called the reports \u201cvery serious\u201d and announced a three-month review, the outcome of which she promised to publish. But once the review was complete, Purdue said the results and any future steps would be kept internal and confidential. On completion of a review, Purdue's stated policy is either to close the matter or to proceed to a fully fledged misconduct investigation. The university won't say which has occurred. Many in the field are disappointed by the lack of information, including Putterman. He is sure that money from the shared DARPA grant was used for the work Purdue reviewed, so he is particularly keen to know whether an investigation is under way. \u201cAs a principal investigator, do I have any right to know what's happening on my project?\u201d In cases where federal money is involved, there is a responsibility to tell the government and the taxpayer how it was spent \u2014 and any misuse of federal dollars can have serious consequences for the researchers involved. If DARPA money was used for any of the disputed work, Purdue would be required to notify the agency of any investigation, and share information relating to it. Such communications could eventually be made public under the US Freedom of Information Act. Taleyarkhan did not acknowledge the DARPA grant in the January  PRL  paper. But when  Nature  asked Putterman to confirm no DARPA money was used, he requested the relevant accounts from Purdue. Putterman now says: \u201cI've reviewed the books, and I am confident that the paper relied on federal money that was not acknowledged.\u201d For example, Taleyarkhan and his colleagues claimed DARPA salaries in the run up to submission of the  PRL  paper (see  'Where did the money go?' ). Taleyarkhan has declined to communicate with  Nature  directly. But he said through a third party \u2014 Brian Josephson at the University of Cambridge, UK \u2014 that Putterman's interpretation of how the work was funded is \u201coff-base and wrong\u201d. Josephson also provided part of an e-mail in which Taleyarkhan strongly denies using the DARPA grant on the disputed work. Taleyarkhan says the experiments were completed by May 2005, several months before the paper was submitted, and that start-up funding from Purdue paid for them. (The university told  Nature  that this funding totalled $58,607.) He adds that he and the others involved worked on the project outside the normal eight-hour day. In the e-mail, Taleyarkhan also says that the bubble fusion described in the  PRL  paper is different from that reported in his previous papers, on which he has warmly acknowledged DARPA funding. He does not give details of what the $251,044 of DARPA money he spent was used for, if not the disputed work. Taleyarkhan's explanation may make little difference if the case is investigated. \u201cIf any part of salary is allocated to a grant awarded by a federal agency, then federal funding is involved,\u201d says Mark Frankel, director of the Scientific Freedom, Responsibility and Law programme at the American Association for the Advancement of Science in Washington DC.  Nature  has confirmed this general interpretation with an investigator at a federal funding agency. Purdue says it has not queried Taleyarkhan's assertion that no federal money was used. \u201cThe authors of the paper are the best source of information on the source of support for research,\u201d says a spokesman. \u201cWe have no reason to question the source of support stated.\u201d \n                     Bubble fusion: silencing the hype \n                   \n                     Desktop fusion is back on the table \n                   \n                     Collapsing bubbles have hot plasma core \n                   \n                     Nuclear flash in a pan \n                   \n                     Physical sciences news channel \n                   \n                     Introduction to sonoluminescence \n                   \n                     Rusi Taleyarkhan's web page \n                   \n                     Seth Putterman's web page \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

And scientists have travelled to Beijing to discuss its first results. Horst Uwe Keller, who is presenting images from the craft's camera, spoke to  Nature  from the meeting.  I work on the Venus Monitoring Camera (VMC). One of our main objectives is to study the highest clouds, around 70 kilometres above the planet's surface. The VMC is the only instrument newly developed for this mission, the rest were reused from Mars Express and the comet mission Rosetta. They didn't have a camera, so I stepped in and said: \u201cYou can't have a mission without a camera.\u201d We built something very small, 1\u20132 kg, to replace the tiny camera on Mars Express that had watched the Beagle 2 lander as it separated. The VMC is four cameras, one for ultraviolet light, one for visible and two for infrared. The results so far are qualitative \u2014 we haven't finished calibrating the instrument yet. But in the sequences of ultraviolet images I presented on Monday you can see the clouds moving, showing the wind direction. As a young postdoc in the 1970s, I remember being at a meeting where a well-known astronomer claimed that Venus's clouds were made of droplets of sulphuric acid. At the time I thought he was crazy, but now we know this is true. What we don't know yet is the nature of the 'ultraviolet absorber' that creates dark features in our cloud images. We hope one of the spectrometers will work out what it is. We are also working on the infrared images, which we'll check for hot spots that might be active volcanism. The surface of Venus is very young, so we know there must be some volcanism, but no one has definitively seen it. If we're lucky we could also find out something about Venus's lightning using the visible-light filter. Some of the most remarkable results at the meeting have come from VIRTIS \u2014 a spectrometer that probes the atmosphere from top to bottom. The pictures of the south pole are really spectacular: they show a double vortex created by the movement of the atmosphere between the equator and the pole. For our team, however, the challenge is simply getting high-quality images. While the spacecraft was cruising into orbit, our camera ended up pointing at the Sun for about 50 hours. The Sun burnt its image into the photodetector. But it's not a complete disaster: we have been able to compensate for the damage by re-measuring the sensitivity of each pixel. \n                     Snapshot: Venus by day and night \n                   \n                     Neglected neighbour \n                   \n                     Venus ahoy! \n                   \n                     Venus Express homepage \n                   \n                     36 th  COSPAR Scientific Assembly, Beijing \n                   \n                     Short biography of Horst Uwe Keller \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

We are about to lose a key piece of our evolutionary history, warn biologists. They are campaigning to save the Australian lungfish, which they fear could be sent extinct by an enormous dam planned for southeastern Queensland. The hefty, muddy-brown fish ( Neoceratodus forsteri ) is thought to have survived virtually unchanged for at least 100 million years, making it one of the oldest known vertebrate species around and earning it the moniker of 'living fossil'. It is also one of the closest living relatives of the ancestral fish that crawled on to land and eventually gave rise to all land vertebrates, including humans. Being able to study the species is important for understanding how that transition took place. The lungfish is now largely confined to two river systems in Queensland \u2014 among the only places that provide the shallow, running and weedy water in which the fish likes to spawn. A dam in one of these, the Burnett river, was completed last year in order to supply water to the drought-stricken region. The area has the fastest growing population in the country, and delivering water to the inhabitants is likely to be a huge problem in the future. But lungfish researchers say that by flooding or drying them out, the dam will eventually destroy nearly half of the lungfish spawning areas. On 5 July, Queensland Premier Peter Beattie announced a decision to dam the second river, the Mary. Partly because the Australian lungfish is listed as a threatened species, the dam must pass a federal environmental-impact assessment before the project can proceed. But lungfish supporters believe the second dam could be enough to drive the species to extinction. The latest decision prompted lungfish expert Jean Joss at Macquarie University in Sydney to step up a campaign to block the dam and persuade the federal government to intervene. Joss has asked colleagues to e-mail Beattie and federal environment minister Ian Campbell to tell them about the scientific importance of the fish \u2014 so far more than 100 scientists have responded to her call. \u201cIt would be a calamitous and irreplaceable loss if this animal went extinct,\u201d says Per Ahlberg of Uppsala University, Sweden, who collaborates with Joss and is helping with the campaign. There are five other species of lungfish living in South America and Africa. But the Australian lungfish, which can live for a century and grow 1.5 metres long, is thought to most closely resemble the last common ancestor of land vertebrates. Biologists say that living fish can be used for genetic and embryology studies that probe how vertebrates moved from water to land \u2014 analyses that would be impossible with preserved specimens. Joss and Ahlberg, for example, are studying the lungfish's patterns of gene activity, to try to work out how fins became limbs. \u201cThese things are amazingly important organisms in the history of the Earth,\u201d says William Bemis who studies vertebrate evolution at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. The Queensland government has guaranteed that the dam will include a 'fish elevator' to carry lungfish across the dam and says that it will do whatever it takes to meet federal environmental requirements, as it did with the last dam. But Joss says that this is not enough, because the lungfish's old spawning grounds will still be destroyed. Lungfish lay very few eggs, and return to the same spawning sites year after year. Should the campaign fail, Joss says she will petition Beattie for money to set up a lungfish breeding centre. But guaranteeing the species' survival in captivity would be tough. So far Joss is the only researcher who has managed to breed them, using two ponds, each the size of an Olympic swimming pool. \n                     The fish that hunts on land \n                   \n                     The fish that crawled out of the water \n                   \n                     Palaeontology: Hooked on fossils \n                   \n                     Strong-arm tactics drove creatures from the pond \n                   \n                     Getting a head \n                   \n                     Premier of Queensland \n                   \n                     Australian lungfish \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

The debate over whether research results should be freely accessible has always been fraught. Having given a lot of ground, journal publishers are determined to hang on to one last bastion: their rights to the published version of scientific articles. Now librarians and open-access advocates have set their sights on that final prize \u2014 by encouraging researchers to demand the right to distribute the published versions freely and immediately. Funding agencies are increasingly adopting policies to make the results of the research they fund free for all. Both the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) and Britain's Wellcome Trust, for example, encourage this practice. They ask that the version of a manuscript accepted for publication be put in an open-access library such as PubMed Central within 6\u201312 months of it coming out. The Wellcome Trust's policy will become compulsory on 1 October, and legislation that would make the NIH policy mandatory is pending in the US Congress (see  Nature   441 , 915; 2006). Ann Wolpert, director of libraries at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Cambridge, Massachusetts, has launched an initiative that she says will clearly assign rights to the author in a way that would satisfy funders. Wolpert has drawn up a document that researchers can add on to the rights agreement the publisher gives them to sign. Similar agreements have been drafted by the Scholarly Publishing and Academic Resources Coalition and the MIT-affiliated Science Commons. \u201cI look at it as responding to a request by faculty members to simplify their lives,\u201d says Wolpert. \u201cThey say 'it is crazy that we are supposed to read and understand these publishers' agreements. Give me something that I can just staple to any agreement, so I can comply with NIH or Wellcome Trust policy'.\u201d But publishers' groups argue that the agreements being drafted go much further than is necessary to comply with current policies. Wolpert's document, for example, would allow authors to publish the final, formatted version of their paper anywhere on the Internet, as many times as they like, immediately after publication. \u201cThis isn't a balance of rights. This is giving MIT all the relevant rights,\u201d says David Hoole, head of brand marketing at Nature Publishing Group. Publishers point out that most journals already allow authors to post the accepted version of their paper online, as required by the NIH and the Wellcome Trust. Such versions have been peer reviewed, but aren't copy-edited, formatted or paginated. But giving authors rights to the final versions, they say, could make it impossible for journals to earn a living. Jerry Cowhig, managing director of the publishing arm of the Institute of Physics, says that the institute provides articles free online for 30 days after publication, and that he is happy for authors to post the accepted versions of their papers. But he is not in favour of making the final, edited version of a paper freely available everywhere. \u201cThat would be a real threat to the continuation of established journals, and the eventual outcome would be to damage scholarship,\u201d he says. Sally Morris, chief executive of the Association of Learned and Professional Society Publishers, agrees. \u201cThe final version is where publishers add value,\u201d she says. On 27 June, Morris's group, along with the International Association of Scientific, Technical and Medical Publishers, wrote to Wolpert outlining their concerns and proposing a meeting. A similar letter went out from the professional and scholarly publishing division of the Association of American Publishers on 7 July. But would giving authors such rights really damage journals? After all, many authors already post the final version of their paper on the web regardless of what their rights agreement says. A study by Jonathan Wren, a bio-informatician at the University of Oklahoma in Norman (J. D. Wren  Br. Med. J.   330,  1128\u20131131; 2005), revealed that the final versions of more than one-third of articles in high-impact journals are freely available online (see  Fig 1 ). Ted Bergstrom, an economist at the University of California, Santa Barbara, argues that for libraries and other users, the convenience and authority of journal subscriptions will still be preferable to searching out free versions of papers individually. So agreements such as Wolpert's shouldn't affect the bottom line of any but the most overpriced publications, he says. Wolpert adds that the value of journals isn't just in locating and reading individual papers, but in browsing and the 'serendipity factor'. \u201cThere is value behind a collection of articles judged worth your attention by smart people in your discipline,\u201d she says. John Cox, a consultant to publishers and academic societies who is based in Chichester, UK, says that the value of papers as they appear on journal websites is often underestimated. \u201cIt's not just the copy-editing, but the infrastructure that is provided: the linking to citations, indexing, alerting services, the presentation of the product on the screen to the reader.\u201d But he argues that the desire to post final versions across the web is misguided because the version published on the journal website will always be definitive. \u201cIt becomes, if you like, part of the minutes of science,\u201d he says. \u201cThat is deeply embedded in the scientific research culture.\u201d \n                     Congress pushes plan to make papers free \n                   \n                     UK research councils claim success for open-access publishing plan \n                   \n                     Access to the literature web focus \n                   \n                     Future e-access to the primary literature \n                   \n                     MIT's Amendment to Publication Agreement \n                   \n                     SPARC addendum \n                   \n                     Science Commons addendum \n                   \n                     Boston Library Consortium on Authors' Rights \n                   \n                     Association of Learned and Professional Society Publishers (ALPSP) \n                   \n                     Joint STM/ALPSP response \n                   \n                     UC faculty senate proposal \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Is it really possible to combine dedication to science with belief in God? In a new book, prominent US scientist Francis Collins sets out his case for combining a strong religious faith with a zeal for the scientific method. But his views have already sparked debate, with critics suggesting that more talk of religion is the last thing that science needs. Collins, who directs the National Human Genome Research Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, and headed the Human Genome Project, has never hidden the fact that he is a devout Christian. But he has never spoken quite so publicly about his faith. He says he felt compelled to write his book because the popular debate on faith and science has become dominated by extreme voices, leaving many feeling that there is no way to reconcile religious and scientific views of the world. \u201cOur society is not well served by portraying a future which is either entirely secular or entirely religious in a fundamentalist way,\u201d he says. Collins also hopes the book,  The Language of God  (Free Press, 2006), will provoke thought in academia, where, he says, the subject of faith isn't exactly popular. \u201cIn most academic circles, a discussion of spiritual matters tends to clear the room fairly quickly.\u201d Discussion, Collins suggests, might rectify the misconception that most scientists are atheists. Surveys find that about 40% of US scientists believe in God, but Collins says that is not reflected in science's public face. That hurts science, he argues, because it drives away curious people who might also be religious believers. Collins takes a strong stand against some religious beliefs, such as creationism and 'intelligent design'. He considers both to be views that restrict faith to covering gaps in scientific knowledge, leaving it in a tenuous position. Instead, Collins embraces a theology sometimes called theistic evolution, or BioLogos. This embraces the idea that human evolution occurred through natural selection according to God's plan, and that God instilled humanity with certain characteristics, including a 'moral law', that can't be explained by science. \u201cThe moral law is a signpost to a God who cares about us as individuals,\u201d Collins says. \u201cGod used a mechanism of evolution to create human beings with whom he could have that kind of fellowship.\u201d Many scientists disagree strongly with such arguments. Some suggest that science is on the defensive today \u2014 not just in the United States \u2014 and that society needs exactly the opposite of what Collins suggests: less talk about faith and more about reason. Religious concerns are largely behind the US law restricting federal funding of stem-cell research, for example. And many feel threatened by the influence of intelligent design in science education. In the United States, \u201cthe default position right now is to assume that religion is perfectly OK\u201d, says Paul Myers, a biologist at the University of Minnesota in Morris and author of the popular science blog Pharyngula. \u201cCollins is taking that default position, and while a large majority of scientists will shrug their shoulders, a few voices will be shouting out, saying 'wait a minute, this is nonsense'.\u201d \u201cI cannot see how this could be good for science \u2014 supernaturalism is fundamentally anti-scientific,\u201d says Richard Dawkins, a biologist from the University of Oxford, UK. \u201cScientists work hard at trying to understand.

Narelle Towie takes a look at some of the most striking entries. Looking like a set of deep-sea headlights, the luminous stare of this myctophid lanternfish was captured by David Forcucci as he worked aboard a research ship in pirate-infested waters off the Somali coast. Caught in a net at 2,000 metres depth, the fish was one of many hauled aboard the RV  Malcolm Baldrige  in 1995 as part of the Globec programme, which studied marine populations in the Indian Ocean. The image earned Forcucci fifth place in his category. During the day, lanternfish lurk in gloomy waters hundreds of metres deep to avoid predators. But as sundown approaches, the fish rise much closer to the surface to feed on zooplankton. Six years after this picture was taken, a US oceanography research ship working in the same area was chased and shot at by pirates (see  Nature   413 , 97; 200110.1038/35093228 ). \u201cIt's a snowboarding whale worm,\u201d says photographer Adrian Glover, a researcher from the Natural History Museum in London. \u201cNot really, but that's what  Bathykurila guaymasensis  looked like when we found him,\u201d he explains. This polychaete, collected by researchers studying whale falls in the Santa Cruz Basin, southern California, was found 1,600 metres down, moving across a white mat of bacteria that were feeding off the bones of a dead grey whale. This frame grab from a video camera attached to a remotely operated vehicle was bagged by Scott France from the Deep Atlantic Stepping Stones research group, and came in the last minutes of a 19-hour dive to study coral communities in the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. Perched high on a coral, this five-armed galatheid crab was lucky to have a seat at all. The 2-metre-tall rare black coral shown here narrowly missed being wiped out by the trawl of a fishing net that destroyed coral directly adjacent to this shot. The image was taken in August 2005 and won its category. The vivid orange colours of this  Stauroteuthis syrtensis  were caught by wildlife photographer David Shale during a research cruise in the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. The image won its category. Nicknamed Dumbo because of two small flipper fins behind its eyes, this 30-centimetre-long octopus was snared in a collection tank attached to the  Johnson-Sea-Link , a small submersible capable of diving to 1,000 metres. Both human occupants and sea life are kept at a chilly 6 \u00b0C while in the submersible. Brrr. This deep-sea demersal shark ( Deania calceus ) fed for 20 minutes before letting hungry arrowtooth eels have their turn on the metal feeding arm of the RObust BIOdiversity lander \u2014 known as ROBIO. By handing out mackerel to scavenging fauna, ROBIO gives researchers from Oceanlab at the University of Aberdeen, UK, the ability to survey sea life. This shot, taken at 931 metres depth in sea waters west of Ireland, earned a 'highly commended' rating for Aberdeen's Nicola King. \n                     A league under the sea \n                   \n                     Divers discover exotic crab \n                   \n                     Marine science: Boiling points \n                   \n                     Oil-rig staff get into marine biology \n                   \n                     Giant squid snapped in the deep \n                   \n                     It came from beneath the sea \n                   \n                     Four-armed jellyfish found \n                   \n                     Earth and environment Channel \n                   \n                     BP Kongsberg Underwater Image Competition 2006 - shortlist \n                   \n                     The 11th Deep-Sea Biology Symposium \n                   \n                     National Oceanography Centre, Southampton \n                   \n                     Undersea Images by Dave Forcucci \n                   \n                     NOAA - North Atlantic Stepping Stones 2005 \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

A strain of avian flu that spread through a family in Indonesia, killing seven of the eight people infected, was accumulating mutations as it spread from person to person, according to confidential sequence data seen by Nature. The functional significance of the mutations isn't clear \u2014 most of them seem unimportant. But influenza researchers say the finding reiterates the need for sequence data to be made more widely available, if the virus is to be better understood. The cluster of cases of the deadly H5N1 strain, which occurred earlier this year, is the first in which the World Health Organization (WHO) has admitted that human-to-human transmission was the most likely cause of spread (see  Nature   441 , 554\u2013555; 2006). Eight members of an extended family in Kubu Sembelang, in north Sumatra, were affected. The first patient, a 37-year-old woman who became ill on 24 April and died on 4 May, is thought to have caught the disease from poultry, then transmitted it to six relatives. One of these, her 10-year-old nephew, who died on 13 May, is thought to have passed the disease to his 32-year-old father (see 'Flu cluster in Indonesia'). Virus isolates from six of the eight family members have been sequenced, but the WHO has not released the data, saying that they belong to Indonesia. Instead, the agency released a statement on 23 May stating that there was \u201cno evidence of genetic reassortment with human or pig influenza viruses and no evidence of significant mutations\u201d. Nature  has now obtained more detail on the genetic changes, which suggest that although the WHO statement was not incorrect, plenty more could have been said. Viruses from five of the cases had between one and four mutations each compared with the sequence shared by most of the strains. In the case of the father who is thought to have caught the virus from his son \u2014 a second-generation spread \u2014 there were twenty-one mutations across seven of the eight flu genes. This suggests that the virus was evolving rapidly as it spread from person to person. One of the mutations confers resistance to the antiviral drug amantadine, a fact not mentioned in the WHO statement. The data were presented by Malik Pereis, a virologist at the University of Hong Kong, at a closed meeting of around a dozen international experts in animal and human health, held in Jakarta, Indonesia, in late June. The virus did not evolve into a pandemic strain \u2014 the combination of mutations was not even enough to allow it to spread beyond close family. Many of the genetic changes did not result in the use of different amino acids by the virus. And there were no amino-acid changes in key receptor binding sites known to affect pathogenicity and transmissibility. But experts say they cannot conclude that the changes aren't significant. \u201cIt is interesting that we saw all these mutations in viruses that had gone human-to-human,\u201d says one scientist who was present at the Jakarta meeting but did not wish to be named because he was commenting on confidential data. \u201cBut I don't think anyone knows enough about the H5N1 genome to say how significant that is.\u201d Elodie Ghedin, a genome scientist at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine in Pennsylvania, says she's surprised that the virus from the father had so many mutations compared with others in the cluster, apparently arising in just a few days. \u201cI have a hard time believing that the father acquired the virus from his son,\u201d she says, adding that the nine mutations in one gene in the father's virus are almost identical to those in viruses isolated from human cases in Thailand and Vietnam in 2004. One possibility is that the father simply caught a different strain of virus from birds, although other mutations in his virus are similar to those in the strain isolated from his son. Or perhaps the virus from the son reassorted with another flu strain circulating in his father at the time, Ghedin says. Part of the reason the picture is so unclear, say virologists contacted by  Nature , is that the continued withholding of genetic data is hampering study of the virus. None of the sequence data from the Indonesian cluster has been deposited in public databases \u2014 access is restricted to a small network of researchers linked to the WHO and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, Georgia. Ghedin, for example, works on how mutations in one area of a genome can predispose other areas to further changes. She is part of a project started in 2004 to sequence thousands of human and bird-flu strains, but she has little access to H5N1 virus from humans. \u201cFlu researchers don't all look at the data from the same angle,\u201d she says. \u201cThe more diverse analyses that are performed, the better we will understand the evolution of this virus.\u201d \u201cIf all of the H5N1 isolates were available, there'd be quite a few people focused on understanding these data,\u201d agrees David Lipman, director of the US National Center for Biotechnology Information in Bethesda, Maryland. But Paul Gully, who joined the WHO two months ago as senior adviser to Margaret Chan, head of the agency's pandemic-flu efforts, defends the agency's position. He points out that the WHO's priority is investigating outbreaks, not academic research. And he adds that although calls for more complete genome data and wider sharing of samples are \u201ca valid point\u201d, labs are stretched during outbreaks, and don't have the time or resources to do high-quality sequencing. He agrees that sharing samples with other researchers would allow such work to be done. But he says the WHO must work within the constraints set by its member states \u2014 they own the data, and decide whether to share it. \u201cAs more countries share data, hopefully that research will get done,\u201d he says. The WHO has not formally asked Indonesia to share the sequences, Gully adds. \u201cWe would rather wait and see what Indonesia decides.\u201d \n                     Action stations \n                   \n                     Pandemic 'dry run' is cause for concern \n                   \n                     Dreams of flu data \n                   \n                     Avian flu centre put under threat of closure \n                   \n                     Indonesia struggles to control bird flu outbreak \n                   \n                     Avian flu web focus \n                   \n                     Avian flu mashup (requires Google Earth) \n                   \n                     Bird flu in focus \n                   \n                     WHO avian flu website \n                   \n                     WHO updates on Indonesia \n                   \n                     Indonesian Ministry of Health \n                   \n                     Namru-2 \n                   \n                     Connotea web resources on avian flu \n                   \n                     Google Earth \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Jayaraman"}], "parsed_as_year": "2006_or_before", "body": "Research agency slammed for patenting everything. New Delhi 'Patent or perish' is the slogan of Ragunath Mashelkar, head of India's largest publicly funded scientific agency. Over the past decade he has turned the 40 or so labs under his control into a patent factory. \u201cOur labs obtain more patents in the United States than all Indian inventors combined,\u201d boasts Mashelkar, who directs the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR). \u201cTo be noticed, you need a portfolio of patents.\u201d But not everyone is impressed. Critics are accusing the council of wasting taxpayers' money by patenting hundreds of spurious inventions that are never exploited. The approach of the CSIR has been to file a patent on any new finding that meets the criteria, whether or not the agency wants to commercialize it, says R. K. Gupta, the CSIR's chief of patents. That strategy has certainly been successful in terms of quantity. Between 2002 and 2006, the CSIR was granted 542 US patents \u2014 more than the total number granted to its counterparts in France, Japan and Germany combined. But according to Suresh Chandran, who handled biotech patents in India before becoming licensing manager for ES Cell International in Singapore, \u201cMost of the patents are not even worth the paper they are printed on.\u201d He points out that each US patent costs the CSIR US$25,000 for filing and $4,000 a year for maintenance. \u201cMaybe it is a passing phase, but I can tell you that we waste quite a lot on this activity,\u201d he says. One example given by critics is a cow urine extract that the CSIR patented in the United States in 2002, claiming that it enhanced the activity of antibiotics. The claim is yet to be backed by a peer-reviewed publication and the CSIR admits that no drug company has shown interest. \u201cWe had a good laugh when we read about it, and that was it,\u201d says a spokesman for a leading drug company in New Delhi, who asked not to be named. Masheklar disputes that the patents are a waste of money, pointing out that a cluster of three US patents on a potential anticancer molecule has been licensed out to an Indian entrepreneur in the United States for around $100,000. Considering that only about 3% of US patents are ever licensed, it is too early for the CSIR to expect big returns, he says. Critics counter that although the strategy of patenting everything has created awareness among scientists of the potential worth of their discoveries, it is time to ensure that patents create products and wealth, not just statistics. A. V. Rama Rao, former director of the CSIR Indian Institute of Chemical Technology in Hyderabad, wants the CSIR to set up an independent division to decide which developments are worth patent applications. \u201cA lot of money is going down the drain in the name of patents,\u201d he says.

Singapore already has a reputation for throwing money at scientists in particular fields it wants to develop. Now, the government says it will almost double its research budget over the next five years, to a hefty 3% of its gross domestic product (GDP). But whereas those in the favoured fields have welcomed the money, others complain that, as ever, basic research is losing out. The government announced on 7 July that its newly established National Research Foundation (NRF) will spend S$1.4 billion (US$876 million) during 2006\u201310 in three areas: biomedical research; environment and water technologies; and interactive and digital media. This is part of the S$5-billion five-year budget set aside for the NRF when it was created in January. Another S$1 billion is earmarked for a project to attract world-class research institutes. As a start, the NRF says it will establish a joint research centre with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology next year in Singapore, and hire 300\u2013400 researchers to work there. How the remaining S$2.6 billion will be spent has yet to be decided. The announcement represents the first big move in the government's ambitious plan to increase its research and development budget to S$13 billion for 2006\u201310, or 3% of the country's GDP. Singapore is famous for big science initiatives, especially in the biomedical sector. One example is Biopolis, a S$500-million development that houses biotech research institutes and pharmaceutical giants such as Novartis. Next year, the government plans to open the first phase of a Fusionopolis complex, which will house information-technology and media companies. Despite previous investment, the NRF's chairman, Tony Tan, says the Singaporean government is concerned about keeping its competitive edge in science and technology research, compared with big and growing economies such as those of India and China. Over the past few years, Tan has travelled to other small but wealthy countries such as Switzerland, Denmark and Sweden to find out how they do it. He says he learned the importance of specializing in a small number of research areas that are likely to turn a profit. The NRF is now discussing exactly how funds in each of the three research areas will be spent and when to start accepting grant applications. S$550 million will go towards biomedical research, especially translational and clinical studies \u2014 a move from the previous focus on basic research. S$330 million is likely to go towards strengthening technologies that allow the country to produce clean water, for domestic use and for export. S$500 million will go towards developing media technologies such as video games and digital cinema. Some academics, such as Barry Halliwell, deputy president of research and technology at the National University of Singapore (NUS), have acclaimed the funding, saying it will help to attract big names from overseas. Others are underwhelmed. The NUS's Juan Walford, who studies seahorses as a barometer for the quality of the marine environment, says the new categories are just a reclassification of areas already given the bulk of government money. \u201cThere is really nothing new,\u201d he says. \u201cIt's all applied technology and engineering, there's no new opening for 'scientific research'\u201d \n                     Ten years of biotech gaffes \n                   \n                     Singapore: An irresistible force \n                   \n                     New biotech oasis? \n                   \n                     Science policy news stories \n                   \n                     Singapore's National Research Foundation \n                   \n                     Singapore's Agency for Science, Technology and Research \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Toronto Reprogramming adult human cells to repair damaged tissues or organs may not be quite as tough as thought. Researchers have devised a chemical cocktail that makes adult mouse cells behave like embryonic stem cells, and the recipe is surprisingly simple. Human embryonic stem cells can develop into all cell types in the body, an ability known as pluripotency, and scientists think these cells will be invaluable for both research and medicine. But the cells are extracted from human embryos, which is controversial in many countries. To skirt the ethical problems, scientists have been searching for alternative sources of such cells (see  Nature   441 , 1038; 2006). And little excites the field more than the possibility of a chemical recipe that can reprogramme adult cells into an embryonic state \u2014 without involving an embryo. Now, Shinya Yamanaka and his colleagues at Kyoto University, Japan, have developed what looks like a good first draft for this recipe, at least in mice. They say it takes only four chemicals. For their experiment, the researchers chose fibroblasts, adult cells that divide quickly and can already give rise to some other types of cell. When they added the four factors to fibroblasts, the team says the cells looked and behaved a lot like mouse embryonic stem cells. \u201cPotentially, if we use these four factors with human cells, we could avoid the ethical issues and make pluripotent cells,\u201d says Yamanaka. The reprogrammed cells pass many of the crucial tests of 'stem-ness'. They express some of the key genes that embryonic stem cells do, can be coaxed to make the three main cell types of the body, and can divide to give more cells like themselves. Yamanaka calls them \u201cembryonic-stem-cell-like cells\u201d. \n               Luck and skill \n             Yamanaka unveiled his research on 30 June at the International Society for Stem Cell Research in Toronto, Canada, revealing that success involved patience, ingenuity and luck. Over five years, his researchers compiled a list of 24 candidate factors that help stem cells stay flexible. They engineered adult mouse cells so that they would be killed by a drug unless they turned on a gene active only in stem cells. Then the team added genes for the 24 candidate factors to the engineered mouse cells, and dosed them with the drug. Only the stem-cell-like cells survived. The researchers repeated this experiment, removing one or a few genes at a time, until they arrived at four essential chemicals. Three of the factors \u2014 Oct4, Sox2 and c-Myc \u2014 were already known to be important for stem-ness. But the fourth was a surprise, says Yamanaka. Stem-cell research is so competitive that he refuses to name this fourth factor until he can publish his work in a scientific journal. His research adds to work on which factors are key to reprogramming. Ihor Lemischka of Princeton University, New Jersey, and his colleagues have studied 70 genes in mouse embryonic stem cells (J. Silva  et al .  Nature  doi:10.1038/nature04914; 200610.1038/nature04914 ). And Austin Smith's team at the University of Edinburgh, UK, is investigating a protein called Nanog (N. Ivanova  et al .  Nature  doi:10.1038/nature04915; 200610.1038/nature04915 ). \u201cSeveral researchers had shown factors that were necessary for programming, but nobody had shown which factors were sufficient,\u201d says Yamanaka. Researchers are impressed and surprised at Yamanaka's achievement, mainly because he gambled everything on the key factors being included within his pool of 24 candidates. \u201cHe seems to have hit a home run,\u201d says Lemischka. But scientists caution that Yamanaka's report has not eliminated the need for work on embryonic stem cells. Researchers must test the same four factors in human cells. And it is not entirely clear whether the reprogrammed cells can do everything that embryonic cells can. Although many of the genes they express are the same, many are not. Yamanaka's report came just a day after the US Senate said it would vote on relaxing rules on embryonic research later this year. Some have argued that progress in reprogramming has made work on embryonic stem cells unnecessary, and they may seize on Yamanaka's work to bolster this position. But scientists at the Toronto meeting said that would be a mistake. \u201cThere will be people who say that, and they will be wrong,\u201d says Lemischka. \u201cThere's a lot more work to do to understand these cells. The science is really solid, but it is by no means true that reprogramming has now been solved.\u201d \n                     Human eggs supply 'ethical' stem cells \n                   \n                     Stem cell superpowers exposed \n                   \n                     Altered embryos offered as solution to stem-cell rift \n                   \n                     Rebooted cells tackle ethical concerns \n                   \n                     Stem cells podcast \n                   \n                     Stem cells Insight \n                   \n                     Stem cells Insight web forum \n                   \n                     Stem cells in focus \n                   \n                     25 years of embryonic stems cells web focus \n                   \n                     Making stem cells web focus \n                   \n                     4th Annual Meeting of the International Society for Stem Cell Research \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Washington DC Since NASA put its Terrestrial Planet Finder (TPF) missions on indefinite hold earlier this year, researchers have proposed at least four alternative and much cheaper spacecraft that could capture starlight reflected from other worlds beyond our Solar System. The proposals range from using a giant shield placed 1.5 million kilometres from Earth, as suggested by Webster Cash of the University of Colorado, Boulder, in this week's  Nature  (see  page 51 ), to telescopes with unusual mirrors and finely engineered cameras. The missions have been proposed to NASA's Discovery programme, which caps the costs of its projects at US$425 million \u2014 about a tenth of the cost of NASA's successor to Hubble, the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). \u201cThe field is more alive than ever,\u201d says Alan Boss, a planetary modeller at the Carnegie Institution of Washington. Astronomers have indirectly detected 194 extrasolar planets so far, all from the ground, by watching the behaviour of their parent stars. But for direct detection, and to stand a chance of studying the planets detected, orbit is the place to be. The TPF, which would cost much more than the JWST, consisted of two planet-spotting missions that would have picked up small fry the size of Earth. The mission was among the top recommendations of a 2000 National Research Council panel, and featured in President George W. Bush's vision for space exploration in 2004. But competing priorities caused the agency to decide that the TPF should be \u201cdeferred indefinitely\u201d and to delay a smaller planet-hunting Space Interferometry Mission by three years (see  Nature   439 , 768\u2013769; 200610.1038/439768a ). A similarly ambitious European mission, Darwin, has a proposed launch date of 2015. But researchers are increasingly optimistic that they can glimpse an alien planet through other methods. Cash's scheme is to place a specially designed piece of black plastic-bag-like material, 30\u201350 metres in diameter, between the JWST and a target star, allowing the scope to pick up the faint light of orbiting planets. The shield would have to be about 40,000 kilometres from the telescope \u2014 itself around 1.5 million kilometres from Earth \u2014 and designed in a distinctive petal shape so that starlight leaking around the edges doesn't drown out the planets. It would have to be able to relocate over great distances to interpose itself between the JWST and various different stars, making it little more than a \u201cbig fuel tank with a hefty bag attached\u201d, Cash says. But he thinks it could reveal Earth-sized planets around nearby stars. NASA is now considering Cash's scheme, along with several other ideas, as possible Discovery missions. \u201cIn the past five years, there's been an exponential growth in concepts,\u201d says Olivier Guyon, an astronomer at the Subaru telescope on Mauna Kea, Hawaii. Guyon has his own application in with NASA for a 1.2-metre space telescope, which would have a configuration of aspherical mirrors that cut down the light from a star enough to directly observe Jupiter-like planets in nearby systems. Other teams from NASA laboratories have their own ideas. The Eclipse mission from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, would use an advanced camera to screen out starlight, while the EPIC mission from the Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, would use interfero-metry to cancel out starlight, leaving dimmer planets visible. Richard Lyon, EPIC's project scientist at Goddard, says that if his team does not win funding this autumn, they might be able to make the mission even cheaper by shrinking the telescope to fit inside a 1.5-metre-long tube just 45 centimetres in diam-eter. But a telescope that small, he notes, would have to stare at a single star for almost a year before gathering enough light to detect a planet. It's not certain that any of these missions will reach space, says Boss. Because of cutbacks to NASA's science budget, researchers must apply for grants for these missions through the Discovery programme, which is normally reserved for missions within our Solar System. Only one such project \u2014 the Kepler mission to search for Earth-sized planets eclipsing distant stars \u2014 has won funding that way. Kepler, a 1.4-metre telescope, is set to launch in 2008. Now TPF itself may have been granted a small reprieve, according to Charles Beichman, the mission's project scientist at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. A congressional budget committee has tentatively earmarked $10 million for the programme, after the president's budget request earlier this year would have wiped it out completely. If finalized, the money would keep the mission on life support. \u201cBut it's clear that the TPF is going to be a long time in the future,\u201d says Beichman. Meanwhile, several ground-based searches are in the planning stages or under way. And in October, the French space agency plans to launch a 30-centimetre space telescope called Corot, with a mission similar to Kepler's. \u201cIf we were relying solely on [approved] NASA space missions, the field would have screeched to a halt,\u201d says Boss. \u201cBut thank God we're not.\u201d \n                     US space scientists rage over axed projects \n                   \n                     Planet hunters lose out to Hubble rescue \n                   \n                     NASA Kepler mission \n                   \n                     CNES/ESA Corot mission \n                   \n                     Guyon's TOPS telescope \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

San Jose For conservation biologists, it's the question that won't go away. Should they make the leap from describing the facts of a case, to telling people what ought to be done? Biologist Reed Noss of the University of Central Florida believes they should. Addressing a meeting of the Society for Conservation Biology (SCB) in San Jose, California, last week, he tried to convince the crowd that they have a responsibility to be not just scientists dealing in objective facts, but also advocates pushing particular policies. But Mike Scott of the University of Idaho, organizer of the symposium, thinks the SCB should stick to the facts. \u201cWe need to position ourselves as the go-to authority on conservation matters worldwide,\u201d he says. \u201cWe can more forcefully do that if we do rigorous science, and then leave it for the decision-makers to figure out what to do with that.\u201d The advocacy question is perhaps more difficult for conservation biologists than many other scientists. Their field is already premised on the value of having lots of species around. And most of these scientists got into the field because of their strong feelings about nature, the wilderness and often particular species. Peter Brussard, a population biologist at the University of Nevada, Reno, points out that the debate goes back to at least 1951. Then the Nature Conservancy split from the Ecological Society of America because of a dispute over whether scientists should do more than just describe. These days, he thinks, \u201cthe debate has been reframed a little bit\u201d, with more researchers willing to be advocates. In the end, he says, much depends on the definition of advocacy. \u201cWe never seem to get beyond semantics.\u201d For example, does advocacy include sending a paper to policy-makers? Or to the press? Or reiterating your findings if you don't think policy-makers have taken enough notice of them? Back in San Jose, the US Geological Survey's Susan Haseltine warns the meeting of the harm a scientist can do to their credibility by being an activist. \u201cI don't believe you can be strong in science and in advocacy,\u201d she says. Meanwhile, the policy-makers to whom all this advocacy is directed have their own views about the information coming from scientists. \u201cI don't mind policy recommendations from scientists,\u201d says Andrew Wheeler, staff director and chief council of the US Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, which handles conservation legislation. \u201cBut I take them with a grain of salt.\u201d Despite the arguments against, it looks as if the members of the SCB are coming round to Noss's point of view. In a survey of about 300 attendees, 70% felt that the voice of the society \u2014 the journal  Conservation Biology  \u2014 should advocate certain policies. \n                     Science academies target G8 agenda \n                   \n                     US scientists fight political meddling \n                   \n                     Conservation: Dollars and sense \n                   \n                     Scientists unite in bid to drive policy \n                   \n                     Scientists must conquer reluctance to speak out \n                   \n                     A case for conservation \n                   \n                     Slow-moving journals hinder conservation efforts \n                   \n                     Earth and environment news channel \n                   \n                     Society for Conservation Biology mission and values \n                   \n                     Ecological Society of America mission \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

New York Tiger conservationists are trying a more business-like approach to saving the threatened species \u2014 focusing not on collecting money but on performance standards. Biologists at the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) in New York want to increase the number of tigers ( Panthera tigris ) at the society's research sites in Asia by 50% over the next decade. WCS director for science Alan Rabinowitz says the plan, called 'Tigers Forever', will differ from previous conservation attempts because the society's biologists, stationed across Asia, have set targets by which their success can be judged. In the past, conservation groups have issued pleas for funds to save tigers while often having no clear idea of how that aim should be achieved. It is virtually unprecedented for a group to announce performance targets in advance. \u201cThis is not a fund-raising exercise,\u201d says Rabinowitz. \u201cWe're putting our ass on the line here. Tigers Forever is designed to measure our impact on increasing tiger populations at specific sites.\u201d As well as judging overall success, the information gained about what works and what doesn't in different areas will guide future action. Although conservation groups have made strides in boosting tiger numbers in some areas, particularly India and Russia, \u201cwe are not using the lessons learned\u201d, says Rabinowitz. Ullas Karanth, an Indian biologist who works with the WCS, adds that \u201cwe are trying to be tough-minded with our people, seeking rigorous reviews of tiger plans\u201d. That philosophy seems to be attracting donors. Michael Cline, a New York businessman and WCS board member, has contributed to the US$10 million already pledged to Tigers Forever. \u201cMore organizations should set goals like this,\u201d he says. \u201cAs a venture capitalist, I believe in fact-based judgements based on likelihood of success.\u201d \u201cI definitely think this will become a trend,\u201d adds Sybille Klenzendorf, a biologist who coordinates tiger programmes at the World Wildlife Fund in Washington DC. From the forests of the Asian subcontinent to the steppes of Russia, poaching, illegal hunting and habitat loss have reduced tiger numbers dramatically in past decades, to between 3,000 and 5,000 animals (see  Nature   441 , 927\u2013930; 2006). The situation is most critical in the jungles of southeast Asian nations, and the WCS will begin by concentrating on selected reserves there (see  'Wildlife Conservation Society Sites in Asia' ). One of the principal goals of the programme is to increase tiger prey. \u201cTigers eat large, hoofed animals,\u201d says Karanth. \u201cThe key to saving tigers is to maintain proper prey density.\u201d WCS biologists in Mondulkiri are relatively optimistic despite the low tiger numbers. Prey species have been dramatically reduced by poaching, owing to the many guns available after years of war. But good habitat remains for both prey and tiger. To bring back the prey species, the WCS is encouraging local agencies and governments to set up a variety of incentive-based actions to cut poaching. These include paying informers to expose illegal hunting, offering bounties for guns or tiger traps, and instituting bonuses for diligent rangers. \u201cThese are not nice things that people want to hear about,\u201d says Rabinowitz. But he says that measures such as the number of traps turned in or the number of poachers identified \u201care really good surrogates to show how much better things are\u201d. \n                     Conservation biology: The tiger's retreat \n                   \n                     Earth and environment news channel \n                   \n                     Wildlife Conservation Society \n                   \n                     Cambodian Tiger Conservation Program \n                   \n                     Amur tigers \n                   \n                     Sumatra Tiger at Honolulu zoo \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

After more than 30 years of studying the physicists who work on gravity waves, spending countless hours talking to physicists and writing a book on the history and sociology of the field, social scientist Harry Collins had a question. Could he pass as a physicist? He reckons he can \u2014and he has the experimental data to prove it. Collins's study, to be published later this year, is the first experiment on the concept of 'interactional expertise', an idea that could influence areas such as peer review and science journalism. It could even help settle a question lingering since the science wars of the 1990s, when sociologists launched what scientists saw as attacks on the very nature of science, and scientists responded in kind. Collins's claim rests on his answers to a set of seven questions about gravity-wave physics set by a gravity-wave physicist. His replies, together with those from a real gravitational physicist, were sent to nine researchers in the field (see  'Faking it' ). Asked to spot the real physicist, seven were unsure and two chose Collins. The results appear in a paper co-authored with Rob Evans, like Collins based at Cardiff University, UK. It is due to be published this December in  Studies in the History of Philosophy of Science  (for a preprint see  http://www.cf.ac.uk/socsi/expertise ). Nature  sent the questions and answers to Sheila Rowan, a gravitational-wave physicist at the University of Glasgow. She was likewise unable to spot the impostor. \u201cThe answers are different but it's not obvious which are not by a graduate scientist,\u201d she says. \u201cI could not run LIGO [a US gravity-wave detector] or do lots of other things,\u201d says Collins. \u201cBut the results do show that outsiders can develop a kind of expertise in a scientific field\u201d, even if they cannot carry out the relevant experiments and do not know the mathematics involved. Collins says this kind of expertise, known as interactional to contrast with the 'contributory expertise' that comes from being able to do experiments and develop theories, should not be dismissed. He points out, for example, that it is important in activities such as grant allocation, in which peer-review panels may include scientists who know the concepts associated with a field, but lack technical understanding. In a second experiment, Collins and Evans got groups of colour-blind people to pretend they could see colours. Judges compared their performance in conversation with that of people with normal sight. As Collins expected, the colour-blind, immersed in the language of colour vision, had the interactional expertise to pass as colour-perceivers. In contrast, people lacking perfect musical pitch could not pass for those who could. Very few have such an ability, so those lacking it have not learnt to describe how the skill feels. If the concept of interactional expertise catches on, it could affect the argument about whether an outsider, such as an anthropologist, can properly understand another group, such as a remote rural community. The debate was part of the science wars, when some scientists claimed that sociologists studying science did not understand the disciplines involved, in part because they did not practise them. Collins's results do not end that discussion, but they do suggest that outsiders can develop expertise in a field. Collins says that investigators now have a way to display their expertise \u2014 and that they and their critics can talk sensibly about whether it is appropriate. One of the main protagonists in the debate was Alan Sokal, a physicist at New York University who authored a spoof science-studies paper that was accepted by  Social Text , a cultural research journal. The paper, which consisted of meaningless arguments about quantum theory, was intended to expose what Sokal and others saw as a lack of academic rigour among sociologists. Sokal says he is struck by Collins's skills in physics, but notes that such understanding would not be enough for more ambitious sociology research that attempts to probe how cultural and scientific factors shape science. \u201cIf that's your goal you need a knowledge of the field that is virtually, if not fully, at the level of researchers in the field,\u201d says Sokal. \u201cUnless you understand the science you can't get into the theories.\u201d One answer to the following question is from an experienced gravity-wave physicist, the other is from social scientist Harry Collins of Cardiff University, UK. To find out which is which, see  page 15 . \n                 A theorist tells you that she has come up with a theory in which a circular ring of particles is displaced by gravitational waves so that the circular shape remains the same but the size oscillates about a mean size. Would it be possible to measure this effect using a laser interferometer? \n               A:  Yes, but you should analyse the sum of the strains in the two arms, rather than the difference. In fact, you don't even need two arms of an interferometer to detect gravitational waves, provided you can measure the round-trip light travel time along a single arm accurately enough to detect small changes in its length. B:  It depends on the direction of the source. There will be no detectable signal if the source lies anywhere on the plane that passes through the centre station and bisects the angle of the two arms. Otherwise there will be a signal, maximized when the source lies along one or other of the two arms.  \n                     Going public \n                   \n                     Harry Collins's Gravitational Wave Project \n                   \n                     Harry Collins and Rob Evans's Expertise Project \n                   \n                     Wikipedia page on the Alan Sokal affair \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

These orbs of blue and red are the planet Venus, as seen by the European spacecraft Venus Express during its cruise into orbit. The composite images are among the first data transmitted from the craft, whose initial results will be discussed at a meeting of the Scientific Assembly of the Committee on Space Research (COSPAR), which convenes on 16 July in Beijing. The gauzy blue to the left is the planet's dayside, imaged with ultraviolet light; it is bright with reflected sunlight. Scientists aren't sure what causes the white stripes \u2014 maybe some kind of aerosol particle is absorbing the ultraviolet light, says H\u00e5kan Svedhem, Venus Express project scientist at the European Space Agency (ESA). The angry red swirls to the right are clouds deep in the venusian atmosphere on the planet's night side. They are seen by infrared light, the only type of radiation that makes it out through the dense atmosphere. The clouds appear as dark shadows in the infrared glow of the planet's hot surface. Unlike Earth's billowing water clouds, the clouds on Venus are made of sulphuric acid. They float in an atmosphere that is mainly carbon dioxide, and are dragged into a spiralling pattern by fierce, westward winds that tear around the planet at hundreds of metres per second. Here, we view the planet from one end, with the clouds circling the south pole. The sequence of images was captured by the ultraviolet/visible/ near-infrared spectrometer (VIRTIS) on Venus Express between 12 and 19 April, from distances of between 190,000 and 315,000 kilometres while the spacecraft moved along a long ellipse around the planet. Venus Express, which took just five months to make the journey from Earth to its neighbour, has since moved into a closer, final orbit. The science instruments were switched off during the craft's orbital manoeuvres, but since 4 June, data from its cameras, spectrometers and analysers have been streaming back to ESA's deep-space antenna at Cebreros, just outside Madrid, Spain. Earlier missions to Venus, by NASA's Mariner probes and the Soviet Union's Venera programme among others, have revealed atmospheric features like those seen in this image. But now the craft is in its final orbit, its suite of modern instruments is probing different aspects of the atmosphere's composition and dynamics in unprecedented detail. Svedhem says the mission scientists are busy planning the craft's future observations, so they have had little chance to look at the data flooding in. They have two more weeks to do so before presenting their findings so far \u2014 on topics ranging from the hunt for surface volcanism to movies of the cloud tops \u2014 at a dedicated session in Beijing. \u201cThe COSPAR meeting will be the first time we've speculated about what we are seeing,\u201d says Svedhem. \n                     Venus ahoy! \n                   \n                     Express delivery to Venus \n                   \n                     Venus makes pass at the Sun \n                   \n                     Space and astronomy news \n                   \n                     Human space flight in focus \n                   \n                     Return to flight special \n                   \n                     Titan special \n                   \n                     ESA Venus Express site \n                   \n                     Venus Express latest news \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

{"file_id": "4411032a", "url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/4411032a", "year": 2006, "authors": [{"name": "Geoff Brumfiel"}], "parsed_as_year": "2006_or_before", "body": "But it criticizes the way the controversial climate result was used. Washington DC It's probably the most politicized graph in science \u2014 an icon of the case for climate change to some, and of flawed science in the service of that case to others \u2014 and it has coloured the climate-change debate for nearly a decade. Now the US National Academy of Sciences (NAS) has weighed in with a report on the \u2018hockey-stick\u2019 plot, which it hopes will finally lay the controversy to rest. The graph purports to chart global temperatures over the past millennium; a sharp rise at the current end is the \u2018blade\u2019 that makes the otherwise flattish line look like a hockey stick. Climate groups have claimed it as evidence of dangerous global warming; sceptics, especially in the United States and Canada, have questioned the study's merit and statistical methodology. In its report, released on 22 June, the NAS committee more-or-less endorses the work behind the graph. But it criticizes the way that the plot was used to publicize climate-change concerns. And it leaves open big questions about whether researchers should be obliged to make their data available (see  Plotting a course ). \u201cWe roughly agree with the substance of their findings,\u201d says Gerald North, the committee's chair and a climate scientist at Texas A&M University in College Station. In particular, he says, the committee has a \u201chigh level of confidence\u201d that the second half of the twentieth century was warmer than any other period in the past four centuries. But, he adds, claims for the earlier period covered by the study, from AD 900 to 1600, are less certain. This earlier period is particularly important because global-warming sceptics claim that the current warming trend is a rebound from a \u2018little ice age\u2019 around 1600. Overall, the committee thought the temperature reconstructions from that era had only a two-to-one chance of being right. The graph arose from the work of Michael Mann, a climatologist now at Pennsylvania State University in University Park, and two colleagues. In two papers published in 1998 and 1999, Mann's team examined tree rings, ice cores and other \u2018proxies\u2019 of past climate, and used them to reconstruct the Northern Hemisphere's temperature over the past millennium (M. E. Mann  et al .  Nature   392 , 779\u2013787; 1998 and M. E. Mann  et al .  Geophys. Res. Lett.   26,  759\u2013762; 1999). The analysis was complex because the proxies were geographically dispersed and contained uncertainties that are often difficult to gauge. For example, the growth of bristle-cone pine trees, which played an important role in the Mann study, depends on temperature, but also rainfall. The researchers concluded in their 1999 paper that \u201cthe 1990s are likely the warmest decade, and 1998 the warmest year, in at least a millennium\u201d, and included a graph showing a sharp upturn in temperature from about 1900 onwards. The plot soon became known as the hockey stick, and was featured prominently in the executive summary for policy-makers in the 2001 report on global warming from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Shortly after it appeared in the report, two Canadians, economist Ross McKitrick and mineral-exploration consultant Stephen McIntyre, attacked the methodology behind the graph, claiming that it was based on insufficient data and flawed statistical analysis. US politicians amplified their complaints, most prominently Representative Joe Barton (Republican, Texas), who in 2005 wrote to Mann demanding he share his data with critics and congressional overseers. In an effort to quell the controversy, the chairman of the House Committee on Science, Representative Sherwood Boehlert (Republican, New York), commissioned the academy to examine the earlier work. The academy essentially upholds Mann's findings, although the panel concluded that systematic uncertainties in climate records from before 1600 were not communicated as clearly as they could have been. The NAS also confirmed some problems with the statistics.

Hungary's national science academy has been criticized for discriminating against scientists living and working abroad. The academy's attitude is frustrating not just researchers but also the Hungarian government, which is trying to reform the country's research system and attract more high-profile scientists. The Hungarian Academy of Sciences (HAS) in Budapest is Hungary's largest and best-funded public research institution. It awards a title, \u2018Doctor of Science\u2019, that is required by professors or lecturers at most Hungarian universities and academic research institutes. Applicants need a certain number of scientific publications, but  Nature  has learned that the academy's medical division treats non-Hungarian publications as worth only half as much as those published in Hungary. \u201cThe rules basically exclude foreign researchers from competition with medical scientists in Hungary,\u201d says G\u00e1bor Vajta, a Hungarian embryologist and cloning expert working at the Danish Institute of Agricultural Sciences in Tjele. He says he has no intention of returning to his native country. \u201cBut if I did, I would practically have to start from the very beginning.\u201d \u201cIt's outrageous,\u201d agrees Csaba Szab\u00f3, a pharmacologist who, after ten years in the United States and United Kingdom, returned to Hungary last year. The policy is also against the spirit of Hungary's membership of the European Union, says Georges Bingen, who oversees mobility programmes at the European Commission's Directorate General for Research. \u201cThis looks like a severe obstacle to mobility,\u201d he says. Last year, the commission set up a mobility charter for researchers in Europe, calling for countries to encourage researchers to work abroad. But the commission has no authority to force a scientific institution to do so. The Hungarian government, which wants to strengthen Hungarian science, is also concerned. \u201cSome of the academy's rules clearly disadvantage scientists who live and publish abroad,\u201d says J\u00e1nos K\u00f3ka, the Hungarian minister responsible for science. K\u00f3ka says the practice is symptomatic of the academy's old-fashioned attitude. \u201cIts election committees still consist of academicians who were socialized in a totalitarian regime,\u201d he says. \u201cThey're used to spending tens of millions of euros without producing any results worth mentioning.\u201d The HAS spends a large portion of its budget on \u201cinherited merits and obsolete institutions\u201d, K\u00f3ka says. Norbert Kro\u00f3, the HAS's vice-president in charge of foreign relations, counters that the academy has been reformed since the fall of Hungary's communist government in 1990. Staffing has been cut by 40%, he says, and about 170 new research groups have been selected by peer review. The HAS promotes researchers' mobility across borders and between academia and industry, he adds. He says he wasn't aware of the discriminatory rules, and that he'll ask the medical section to take action: \u201cIf these rules really are applied they need to be changed.\u201d \u201cThere are two major lobbies within the academy,\u201d says G\u00e1bor T\u00e1mas, a neuroscientist at the University of Szeged. \u201cOne faction wants changes, the other does not.\u201d T\u00e1mas says reform is needed urgently. But he warns against dismissing the academy's performance. Some HAS institutes, such as the Institute of Experimental Medicine in Budapest and the Biological Research Center in Szeged, produce some of the best science in the country, he says. Critics and supporters of the academy should stop blaming each other, says Ern\u00f5 Duda, president of both Solvo Biotechnology in Budapest and the Hungarian Biotech-nology Association. He agrees that the academy needs to change, but also that Hungary's overly hierarchical universities must open up. \u201cUntil a few years ago I would have said that financing was the biggest obstacle to biotechnology in Hungary,\u201d he says. \u201cNow the biggest problem is our obsolete and old-fashioned academic research system.\u201d \n                     Ukraine scientists grow impatient for change \n                   \n                     Homeward bound European Union \n                   \n                     Hungarian science: Dreaming on the Danube \n                   \n                     Hungarian Academy of Sciences \n                   \n                     European researcher\u2019s mobility portal \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

She concludes that there is no evidence that screening increases a woman's chance of having a healthy baby. Some of the fertility researchers in the audience are clearly incensed. \"You have a beautiful approach but the wrong answers!\" complains Yury Verlinsky, director of the Reproductive Genetics Institute in Chicago and a pioneer of preimplantation genetics. \"Abnormal human embryos are an obvious fact, so if you remove those, how can there be no benefit?\" Staessen's response: do the trials and prove to me it works.  \n             50\u00b004' N 14\u00b026' E; 09:27 local time  \n           \n             28 June 2006, 07:30 UT, Hinxton, UK  \n           At the European Bioinformatics Institute, Nicolas Le Nov\u00e8re launches a parameter scan on a computational model of biochemical pathways involved in neuronal signalling; a beautiful pattern of curves appears on his screen.

Human embryonic stem-cell lines have been successfully produced without using fertilized eggs. The researchers responsible work in Italy, which has some of the most restrictive embryo-research laws in the world.They hope the work will be welcomed as an ethically acceptable source of stem cells, as it does not involve destroying a viable embryo. Embryonic stem cells are of great interest to medical researchers because they can transform into many different cell types, such as muscle, skin or brain cells. But there are ethical worries about pursuing such research, because creating an embryonic stem-cell line involves destroying a human embryo. Many countries have either banned the process in humans, or placed restrictions on the work that can be done. One solution is to extract stem cells from parthenotes, embryo-like structures that develop from eggs without the need for fertilization. Some animals, such as insects and sea urchins, can reproduce in this way. Mammal ian parthenotes, by contrast, always die before implanting in the womb, but they survive long enough to be a potential source of stem cells. Cell lines have been derived in the past from mice and monkeys. Now Tiziana Brevini and Fulvio Gandolfi of the University of Milan have achieved the feat in humans. From 104 eggs, donated by women at a local fertility clinic, they were able to derive two cell lines. Because a parthenote does not have the genetic ability to form an individual, Brevini and Gandolfi have spent the past two years characterizing the cells to make certain that they behave like normal embryonic stem-cell lines. \u201cWe wanted to be sure before saying something,\u201d notes Gandolfi. The researchers announced their results at the annual meeting of the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology in Prague on 21 June, alongside other teams also trying to develop alternative sources of embryonic stem cells (see  \u2018Philosophical approach\u2019 ). The work is attracting high praise from other researchers in the field. \u201cThis is exciting. It was very important to show this in humans,\u201d says Alan Trounson, a stem-cell researcher from Monash University in Melbourne, Australia. He notes that the cells seem slightly more difficult to handle than normal embryonic stem cells, but adds that it is hard to tell whether this is likely to be a general characteristic of parthenogenetic lines. \u201cIf we can learn to handle them better, this could well be an acceptable alternative to embryonic stem cells,\u201d he says. Brevini and Gandolfi plan to submit their work for publication shortly. The researchers do not think work on parthenotes will replace conventional embryonic stem-cell research. But Brevini says she hopes it will open the field to researchers in countries with strong restrictions. In Italy, for example, the creation or destruction of human embryos for research is banned, and the United States does not allow federal money to be used for such work. Parthenote lines \u201cmay be acceptable to the US administration, so they will release funds to work on these kinds of cells\u201d, she says. Brevini adds that she prefers to work with these lines: \u201cI feel more comfortable dealing with a parthenote than an embryo.\u201d One secret of the group's success seems to be its relatively plentiful supply of eggs. Italy bans the creation of more than three embryos at once during  in vitro  fertilization, all of which must then be implanted. More than three eggs are often extracted from women undergoing the treatment, so they can donate those left over to researchers. Unfortunately, the supply is starting to dry up as women choose to freeze their extra eggs.

Declan Butler reports on the risks run by researchers as they struggle to pursue their studies. A chemist's mutilated body dumped on a street in Basra; a physicist shot twice in the back in Baghdad; a dean of engineering kidnapped by a hit squad, his body left on his wife's doorstep. Each week brings reports from Iraq of assassinations or kidnappings of scientists, academics and intellectuals, in what many argue is a systematic effort to eliminate or exile a group crucial to the country's reconstruction. One of the first academics murdered was Muhammad al-Rawi, president of Baghdad University, assassinated in his clinic by a hit squad on 27 July 2003. In the chaos of Iraq, precise body counts are impossible, but observers have recorded several hundred assassinations of academics, with the rate of killings increasing over the past 18 months (see  \u2018Victims of violence\u2019 ). More than 2,000 scientists are thought to have fled abroad. Lack of investigation and prosecutions means little is known about the motives of the killers. Dlawer Ala'Aldeen, an Iraqi microbiologist at the University of Nottingham, UK, cautions that it is generally impossible to attribute assassinations to any one cause or group. Some academics were part of the apparatus of Saddam Hussein's Ba'ath party and were victims of revenge, particularly in the aftermath of Hussein's fall, says Ala'Aldeen. But he believes there is now a broader range of political drivers. \u201cThe universities reflect the power struggles among the various groups in wider society,\u201d he says, with a war being waged between secular, Islamic and other factions. \u201cIt's so easy these days to lose your life in Iraq.\u201d The breakdown in security and stability under the US occupation has also led to spiralling levels of organized crime and corruption. Mohamed Al-Rubeai, an Iraqi chemical engineer at University College Dublin, Ireland, thinks academics are killed simply as part of wider attempts by \u201cterrorists and Ba'athists\u201d to target anyone trying to restore normality in Iraqi society. Nonetheless, many scientists \u2014 including Ala'Aldeen \u2014 are convinced that academics are being singled out. \u201cSome of these murders are instigated by greed and criminality,\u201d says Rafid Alkhaddar, a water engineer at Liverpool John Moores University, UK. \u201cBut I and a vast number of Iraqis believe that there is an organized campaign to eliminate any remaining intellectuals inside Iraq.\u201d \u201cTerrorist forces are out to scare the scientific community,\u201d agrees Abbas Al-Hussaini, a civil engineer at the University of Westminster, UK, and general-secretary of the Iraq Higher Education Organizing Committee (IHEOC) in London, created in January 2004 to help reconstruct Iraq's devastated research and higher-education system. Scientists and academics in Iraq enjoy \u201cmuch greater prestige and status than in the West, and could transform it into a modern society\u201d, says Al-Hussaini. \u201cThat is why they are being targeted.\u201d He too believes the main perpetrators are former members of the Ba'ath party. Some Ba'athists are also cynically highlighting the plight of academics \u201cto imply that the situation is worse than under Saddam\u201d, he claims. \u201cIn one way it is, but under Saddam's brutal dictatorship people had no rights; the future is now more hopeful.\u201d Others take conspiracy theories further. The BRussells Tribunal, a Brussels-based people's court modelled on the Russell Tribunal, a US movement opposed to the Vietnam War, believes the killings are due to militia death squads associated with US forces. The tribunal is made up of prominent intellectuals, human-rights campaigners and non-governmental organizations, including linguist and left-wing campaigner Noam Chomsky, and Denis Halliday, former United Nations humanitarian coordinator in Iraq. The tribunal launched a petition in April, signed by many intellectuals including several Nobel prizewinners in literature, describing the killing of academics as the \u201cdecimation of the secular middle class \u2014 which has refused to be co-opted by the US occupation\u201d. Ophthalmic surgeon Ismail Jalili, former president of the UK Iraqi Medical Association and a member of the board of the British Arab Medical Association, takes a similar line. Jalili, who fled Iraq in 1969 after being imprisoned and tortured, says he believes many of the killings bear the \u201challmark\u201d of professionals (see  \u2018Under the gun\u2019 ). But despite varying views about who is behind the killings, Iraqis agree that the assassinations are unlikely to stop soon, and that the targets need protection. Most killings take place on the way to or from work, so Mosa Al-Mosawe, president of Baghdad University, suggests building a residential complex on campus, with armed guards, to protect staff and their families. Foreign universities need to shelter Iraqi researchers who have received death threats, says Al-Hussaini. Since the fall of Baghdad, Ala'Aldeen has arranged for many Iraqis to work at the University of Nottingham. But many Western institutions are unaware of the issue, says Al-Hussaini. \u201cOften it is only a matter of getting researchers and their families out for a few months,\u201d he says, to get them out of the line of fire. The insurgency has undermined university reconstruction efforts \u201cbeyond belief\u201d, says Ala'Aldeen. For the first time, this year no Iraqi students or staff are coming to Nottingham. \u201cThey don't reply to e-mails; their focus has gone; they can't plan; their lives are shattered.\u201d \u201cUnder mayhem and terrorism, a very advanced academic system, the star of the Middle East, has been reduced to nothing,\u201d he says. \u201cIt's heartbreaking to see a bunch of bright academics who should be rebuilding unable to do so.\u201d One glimmer of hope is Kurdistan in the north of Iraq, where many of the country's scientists have moved. The region, which has been relatively autonomous from both Saddam Hussein and US forces, is a haven of relative security. University reconstruction is proceeding apace, and Ala'Aldeen intends to hold the next IHEOC conference there next April. \u201cIt's symbolic; it will be in Iraq,\u201d he says. \u201cWe are excited about it.\u201d \n                     German hostage was saving Iraq digs \n                   \n                     US bungled investigation into weapons research in Iraq \n                   \n                     100,000 civilians may have died in Iraq conflict \n                   \n                     Iraqi killings prompt calls for US to evacuate weapons scientists \n                   \n                     Iraqi science faces lonely road to recovery \n                   \n                     Iraqi Higher Education Organising Committee \n                   \n                     UNESCO Iraq site \n                   \n                     US Embassy in Iraq \n                   \n                     List of assassinated Iraqi academics  \n                   \n                     Brussels Tribunal list \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Some people in Papua New Guinea who once feasted on their own relatives did not succumb to the prion disease kuru until 50 years later, say researchers who have laboriously tracked down the last sufferers in remote villages. The discovery renews concern that another human prion disease, variant Creutzfeldt\u2013Jakob disease (vCJD), might be incubating silently in some populations and could rear its head decades from now. Neurologists have long been fascinated by kuru, which caused an unprecedented epidemic of neurodegenerative disease in the Fore people of Papua New Guinea that peaked in the 1950s and early 1960s. In death rituals, families steamed and ate the bodies of their relatives \u2014 along with, it was later discovered, infectious prion proteins that caused the debilitating and fatal disease. The ritual was prohibited in the mid-1950s by the Australian authorities who governed that part of Papua New Guinea, and the disease eventually became less frequent. Interest in kuru reawakened with the realization that vCJD, transmitted from cows infected with bovine spongiform encephalopathy, might cause a similar epidemic among those who ate infected meat in the 1980s and 1990s. So far, only 156 deaths from vCJD have been reported in Britain, the worst-affected country, and the number of new cases peaked in 2000, suggesting that vCJD takes about ten years to incubate. But debate continues about whether another wave of cases could yet appear. John Collinge at University College London and his colleagues went to Papua New Guinea to find out. Most people with kuru have already died, but the team ramped up existing disease monitoring to find the last of the epidemic. Working with local communities, they scoured isolated villages that are typically more than 2,000 metres above sea level, lost in dense rainforest and connected only by tracks. \u201cIt's arduous trekking,\u201d says Collinge. Between 1996 and 2004, the researchers found what they believe are the last 11 cases of kuru. Patients' histories were collected, to piece together when they were probably infected. The longest incubation time was calculated to be at least 56 years, and perhaps seven years longer \u2014 although the average incubation time seems to be 12 years (J. Collinge  et al .  Lancet   367,  2068\u20132074; 2006). \u201cFor the first time we can see the extraordinary incubation period in human prion disease,\u201d says Collinge. \u201cIt's sobering that, half a century on, this disease has not disappeared.\u201d Collinge says that vCJD could have a much longer average incubation time, of 30 years or more, because the prions are passing from cows to humans rather than between humans. A species barrier extends incubation times in animal tests. People who have already succumbed to vCJD might have been particularly genetically susceptible, as other evidence has suggested. Mathematical models used to predict the size of a vCJD epidemic could now include these findings. \u201cMost people seem to think we're over the worst,\u201d Collinge says. \u201cWe have to be cautious about assuming this disease is going away.\u201d \n                     Blood test detects deadly prions \n                   \n                     Fears grow as blood stocks pass on prions undetected \n                   \n                     Tissue survey raises spectre of 'second wave' of vCJD \n                   \n                     Our ancestors had brains - for dinner \n                   \n                     Old epidemic sheds new light on vCJD \n                   \n                     Prion Disease in focus \n                   \n                     UK National CJD Surveillance \n                   \n                     NINDS Kuru information page \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

A coalition of scientists aims to kick-start the stalled search for a vaccine against the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The researchers will mine the genomes of HIV-positive patients from many countries in the hope of finding ways to help the immune system fight HIV. Scientists have been trying to figure out for years why some people are less susceptible to HIV than others. Studies on specific groups of patients such as Kenyan prostitutes have identified a handful of natural genetic variations that influence susceptibility to the infection. Leaders of the coalition now plan to combine data from many of these groups, to scan the whole genome of each patient instead of particular genes, and to focus on patients who have been tracked since the early days of their infection. \u201cThe past 10 or 15 years of genetic work on HIV cohorts has been pretty painful,\u201d says Amalio Telenti of the University of Lausanne in Switzerland, an organizer of the initiative. \u201cThis is a whole new ball game.\u201d The coalition, called EuroCHAVI, will include data from 600 patients in seven European countries and Australia, and will be funded by the Center for HIV/AIDS Vaccine Immunology (CHAVI), based at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina. CHAVI investigators also plan to set up study groups in Africa. The scientists will look for differences between patients at hundreds of thousands of specific locations in the patients' genomes, hoping to find variations that influence how well people control the virus early in their infection. Identifying the genes involved should yield clues to how to design a better vaccine. Large genetic studies are already under way for other conditions, including malaria and tuberculosis. But such an approach is more difficult with HIV because it cannot be studied in entire families, making it much harder to track inherited variations. The new studies have only become possible because of the recent construction of the HapMap, a catalogue of sites of variation in the human genome that was published last year (International HapMap Consortium  Nature   437 , 1299\u20131320; 2005). Even so, it's still a gamble that the whole-genome studies will yield results. \u201cThere's no guarantee that this approach is going to work \u2014 it's very much a betting game, like anything else we do,\u201d says Sunil Ahuja, a clinical researcher at the University of Texas Health Science Center in San Antonio, who is not involved with the EuroCHAVI study. \u201cBut you've got to take a shot.\u201d \n                     Geneticists hail variety show \n                   \n                     AIDS special \n                   \n                     HapMap web focus \n                   \n                     Center for HIV-AIDS Vaccine Immunology \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Revelations about the unauthorized transfer of tissue samples by a US neuroscientist are adding to the challenges faced by researchers who are attempting to set up biobanks \u2014 stores of human tissues that can be used to probe the causes of disease. The latest problems stem from the case of Trey Sunderland, chief of the Geriatric Psychiatry Branch of the National Institute for Mental Health. He is accused of shipping more than 3,000 samples of human spinal fluid to the drug company Pfizer without approval from his employers. A subcommittee of the US House Committee on Energy and Commerce, which is investigating the shipments, said on 13 June that Sunderland received $285,000 for the samples. This was part of more than $600,000 he received from the company between 1998 and 2004. Sunderland invoked his right not to testify against himself at a 14 June hearing. His lawyer did not return phone calls seeking comment. The allegations, which surfaced after a tip-off from a whistleblower in April last year, angered lawmakers. \u201cWhat we have learned from this investigation is that the National Institutes of Health (NIH) lacks adequate controls for human tissue samples, human subject protection, and the scientific conduct of many of its senior employees,\u201d says committee member John Dingell (Democrat, Michigan). Such criticism worries researchers, because scientists are starting to use stored banks of tissue to link genetic, medical and personal health data. Iceland, Estonia and the United Kingdom are already developing national databases, and the United States is considering setting up a biobank containing information on hundreds of thousands of Americans (see  Nature   429 , 475\u2013477; 2004). The NIH has already announced two specific projects linking genetic and environmental information on patients with conditions such as Alzheimer's disease. Ethicists and scientists fear that reports of lax policies and misconduct will hurt such initiatives. \u201cIf there is a perception that the researcher is using the samples to line his or her pockets on the side, you're going to lose public support,\u201d says Arthur Caplan, an ethicist at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. \u201cThere is nothing more corrosive to altruism than people making money off research.\u201d Scandals elsewhere have already had similar effects. In Britain, for example, scientists reported a drop in the donation of organs for research after a pathologist at Alder Hey Hospital in Liverpool was revealed to have illegally removed organs from the bodies of children on which he had conducted post-mortems (see  Nature   409 , 655; 200110.1038/35055696 ). The incident led to new human-tissue legislation in 2004 and the creation of the Human Tissue Authority, tasked with overseeing the handling of such samples. In Sunderland's case, a lack of oversight is giving particular cause for concern. \u201cA lot of this stuff was collected with pretty vague consent and rules,\u201d says Caplan. \u201cIt's an issue and it's going to pop up again.\u201d Michael Gottesman, NIH deputy director for intramural research, says the agency will clarify its policies on the storage and shipment of tissue samples and develop an electronic database for tracking patient samples in all of its 27 branches. Such measures could help to restore confidence among potential donors. But biobank officials will have to tackle other issues if the initiatives are to succeed, such as questions about who \u2018owns\u2019 the information stored in tissue repositories. In April, for example, a US federal judge had to intervene in a dispute between patients, a researcher and the University of Washington in St Louis over a valuable tissue repository housed at the university (see  Nature   440 , 1102\u20131103; 2006).

Helen Pearson reports. Bioethicists and civil-rights activists are calling into question plans by two US companies to single out liars by sliding them into a brain scanner and searching their brains for give-away patterns of deception. The two firms say that they will give the accused a chance to prove their innocence using a technique more accurate than the discredited polygraph. No Lie MRI will start offering services out of Philadelphia this summer. Those behind the second company, Cephos, based in Pepperell, Massachusetts, say they hope to launch their technology later this year. Likely clients include people facing criminal proceedings and US federal government agencies, some of which already use polygraphs for security screening. Critics say that the science underlying the companies' technique is shaky and that the premature commercialization of the method raises ethical concerns about its eventual use in interrogation. This week, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) entered the debate by organizing a 20 June briefing on the issues for scientists, the public, the press and policy-makers in Washington DC. The field of lie detection is littered with dubious devices. The polygraph relies on the idea that lying is stressful, and so measures changes in heart rate, breathing and blood pressure. But because it can be duped by countermeasures and there is little hard evidence that it actually works, it is rarely admitted as evidence in court. Rather than relying on indirect measures of anxiety, assessing brain activity using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) goes to the very source of the lie. In one of the earliest studies, a team led by Daniel Langleben of the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, and his colleagues offered students sealed envelopes containing a playing card and $20. The students were told they could keep the money if they could conceal which card they held when questioned in an MRI machine (D. D. Langleben  et al .  NeuroImage   15,  727\u2013732; 2002). These and other studies revealed that particular spots in the brain's prefrontal cortex become more active when a person is lying. Some of these areas are thought to be involved in detecting errors and inhibiting responses, backing the idea that suppressing the truth involves additional areas of the brain to telling it. The early studies showed that it was possible to make out subtle changes in brain activity caused by deception using pooled data from a group of subjects. But to make a useful lie detector, researchers must be able to tell whether an individual is lying; when only one person is assessed it is much harder to tease out a signal from background noise. Langleben, who advises No Lie MRI, says he is now able to tell with 88% certainty whether individuals are lying (see  Nature   437 , 457; 2005). A group working with Cephos, led by Andrew Kozel, now at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas, makes a similar claim. \n               Thought police \n             Kozel and his colleagues asked 30 subjects to take either a watch or a ring, hide it in a locker and then fib about what they had hidden when they were questioned inside a scanner. Using the results of this study, the team devised a computer model that focuses on three regions of the brain and calculates whether the shift in brain activity indicates lying. When the model was tested on a second batch of 31 people, the team reported that it could pick up lies in 90% of cases (F. A. Kozel  et al .  Biol. Psychiatry   58,  605\u2013613; 2005) But critics of the technology urge restraint. \u201cUntil we sort out the scientific, technological and ethical issues, we need to proceed with extreme caution,\u201d says Judy Illes of the Stanford Center for Biomedical Ethics, California. One problem is that there is no standard way to define what deception is or how to test it. Scientists also say that some of the statistical analyses used in the fMRI studies are questionable or give results that are perilously close to the thresholds of significance. \u201cOn individual scans it's really very difficult to judge who's lying and who's telling the truth,\u201d says Sean Spence of the University of Sheffield, UK, who was one of the first to publish on the use of MRI in the study of deception. \u201cThe studies might not stand up to scrutiny over the long term.\u201d Another concern raised by scientists and bioethicists is that the contrived testing protocols used in the laboratory \u2014 in which subjects are told to lie \u2014 cannot necessarily be extrapolated to a real-life scenario in which imprisonment or even a death sentence could be at stake. They say there are no data about whether the technique could be beaten by countermeasures, and that data collected from healthy subjects reveal little about the mindset of someone who genuinely believes they are telling the truth or someone who is confused, delusional or a pathological liar. \u201cIf I'm a jihadist who thinks that Americans are infidels I'll have a whole different state of mind,\u201d says Gregg Bloche, an expert in biomedical ethics and law at Georgetown University Law Center, Washington DC, and a member of the ACLU panel. \u201cWe don't know how those guys' brains are firing.\u201d Because of these concerns, legal experts say that the technology is unlikely to pass the standards of scientific accuracy and acceptance required for it to be admissible in a US court. But even if it is not sufficiently accurate and reliable today, it may well be tomorrow, as more and more people are tested and techniques refined. That raises a second set of concerns that revolve around who should be allowed to use the technique and under what circumstances. Bioethicists worry that fMRI lie detection could quickly pass from absolving the innocent to extracting information from the guilty \u2014 in police questioning, immigration control, insurance claims, employment screening and family disputes. Their concerns are fuelled by other emerging lie-detection technologies, such as those that measure the brain's electrical activity (see  Nature   428 , 692\u2013694; 2004). \n               Truth be told \n             Particularly in the aftermath of 11 September 2001, they worry that fMRI and other devices might be misused in the hands of the military or intelligence agencies. \u201cThere's enormous pressure coming from the government for this,\u201d says bioethicist Paul Root Wolpe at the University of Pennsylvania. \u201cThere is reason to believe a lot of money and effort is going into creating these technologies.\u201d On top of this, ethicists say there is something deeply intrusive about peering into someone's brain in search of the truth; some even liken it to mind-reading. In future, they say, a suspect might be betrayed by their prefrontal cortex before they even open their mouth \u2014 if, for example, the brain recognizes a particular photo or foreign word. \u201cThis is the first time that we have ever been able to get information directly from the brain. People find the idea extraordinarily frightening,\u201d Wolpe says. No Lie MRI founder Joel Huizenga and Cephos head Steven Laken say they are aware of both the scientific limitations and the ethical concerns. Laken says that the company only plans to use the technique with people and questioning protocols that are as similar as possible to those used in the study, and that he wants to work with attorneys to iron out problems along the way. \u201cWe really want to get the science right,\u201d Laken says. \u201cWe don't want to get to court and be killed.\u201d In terms of the ethics, they point out that the test can only be used on those who consent \u2014 because an unwilling subject could easily foil the fMRI machine by simply moving or refusing to answer the questions. (Critics counter that just declining an fMRI test could be incriminating.) No Lie MRI has a licensing agreement for the technology from the University of Pennsylvania and Langleben says he would \u201cyank their licence\u201d if the company overstepped ethical boundaries. Whatever the objections, the two companies say they are already receiving numerous enquiries from people eager to prove their innocence. Huizenga says that he has eight TV shows lined up to document some of the first customers' slide into the machines. The ultimate goal, he says, is to have franchises all over the world. These would collect MRI scans and beam data to the company's computers for central analysis. The company will charge $30 per minute for the scans, which might take one hour, plus additional fees for legal assistance and developing questions. Some researchers feel that such plans are of only limited cause for concern. \u201cMost people who do brain imaging think this is far too soon and that this will crash and burn,\u201d says Spence. \u201cSo it's not worth getting worked up about.\u201d But bioethicists maintain that there needs to be far greater discussion, both within and beyond the scientific community, before the technology is unleashed. Stanford law professor Hank Greely organized a March workshop on lie detection and the law and is also a member of the ACLU panel. He suggests that an impartial agency should introduce a regulatory scheme that would prevent the use of MRI for lie detection until there was sufficient evidence to conclude that it was proven safe and effective \u2014 much as the US Food and Drug Administration bars or approves a drug. Bioethicists add that neuroscientists in particular need to flag up some of the social and legal issues if they are to avoid fMRI earning a bad label. \u201cThe scientists involved in this have an absolute obligation to shepherd this technology,\u201d Wolpe says. \n                     Ethicists urge caution over emotive power of brain scans \n                   \n                     Brain-scan ethics come under the spotlight \n                   \n                     Brain imaging could spot liars \n                   \n                     The truth about lying \n                   \n                     Outspoken nuclear scientist 'forced out' over polygraph row \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

European nations have long cast envious glances across the Atlantic at the industrial spin-offs \u2014 and the associated wealth \u2014 created by US universities. But how hard should the continent's governments push when it comes to persuading their universities to become more focused on application? A report released last week shows that Britain is pushing pretty hard, and critics say the country risks undermining fundamental research in order to subsidize industry-funded projects. Scientists might have been expected to welcome the proposed changes, which involve reform of the much-criticized Research Assessment Exercise (RAE). The roughly five-yearly process, in which peer review is used to assess and reward individual university departments, is widely acknowledged to have boosted the quality of British science since it was introduced in 1992. But given that the assessment has paid off, and the preparing and processing of the submissions is so time-consuming, the RAE is felt to have had its day. Yet proposals to make the 2008 RAE the last of its kind are attracting as much criticism as the current mechanism does. In a consultation document released on 13 June, the government suggested that money be allocated to universities based on how much income they already attract from competitive grants, charities and industrial contracts. The system was chosen because, across the whole university sector, this income correlates well with the results of RAE peer review. But the correlation doesn't always hold at the level of individual universities. Five different models are proposed, all of which have roughly the same effect of boosting universities that are good at bringing in money, such as those with the research capacity to attract significant funding from medical charities (for example, University College London) or industry (such as Cranfield University), and taking money from those for whom such activity is a smaller component of their total income (see  \u2018Who would the scheme most affect?\u2019 ). \n               Poorly rated \n             Other countries have made use of metrics, but the British initiative is the boldest and most application-focused. Germany, for example, uses income measures to allocate around a quarter of local-government funding for universities, but a range of other metrics, including the number of graduates and PhDs, are also considered. If the British system goes ahead, it will mean that \u201cuniversities are there to do research for other people\u201d, says Tom Sastry, a Bristol-based senior researcher at the Higher Education Policy Institute, an independent think-tank. He and other critics fear that this is the intention of the Treasury, which wants to push universities towards application-driven projects; the Treasury first outlined the metrics plans in the budget this March. Fundamental research, which does not attract so much external funding, could then suffer. \u201cMany theoretical fields are going to find it hard,\u201d agrees Anthony Van Raan, an expert in research assessment methods at Leiden University in the Netherlands. Van Raan and others say that the Treasury is right to focus on metrics, but only if a broad range of measures is used. These could include numbers of PhD students trained, together with some form of bibliometric analysis and other output measures, such as patents gained. \u201cThe scientific community will be disappointed if the final models are not more sophisticated,\u201d says Jonathan Adam, director of Evidence, a Leeds-based consultancy that analyses the quality of international research. The Treasury seems, however, to have limited interest in expanding the range of metrics used. Neither of the authors behind the consultation document \u2014 David Eastwood, vice-chancellor of the University of East Anglia in Norwich, and Alan Wilson, director-general for higher education in the government's Department for Education and Skills \u2014 would comment. But a Treasury spokesman, while noting that the consultation asked for views on the possibility of including other metrics, said that \u201cbibliometrics are not sufficiently developed to have been incorporated into the modelling\u201d and described PhD numbers as a \u201cless robust measure\u201d. Such points are disputed by policy experts. Crude bibliometrics measures, such as the number of citations earned by a department, are accepted as being inadequate because some fields, such as mathematics, tend to use fewer references than others, such as genetics. But Van Raan and Adam have independently developed more sophisticated impact measures that place citation numbers in context within disciplines and between countries, and both say that such metrics should form a part of any university assessment system. Unless the range is expanded, says Van Raan, universities could become overly focused on short-term pay-offs: \u201cThis might stop research that could be interesting in ten years or so.\u201d The proposals are open for comment until 13 October.

The Public Library of Science (PLoS), the flagship publisher for the open-access publishing movement, faces a looming financial crisis. An analysis of the company's accounts, obtained by  Nature , shows that the company falls far short of its stated goal of quickly breaking even. In an attempt to redress its finances, PLoS will next month hike the charge for publishing in its journals from US$1,500 per article to as much as $2,500. Subscription-based journals recover much of the costs of peer review and editing \u2014 and in the case of commercial publishers such as Nature Publishing Group, make some of their profits \u2014 by charging for access to their products. But the PLoS journals, the first of which launched in 2003, adhere instead to an \u2018author pays\u2019 open-access model: costs are recovered by charging authors, and papers are made available free of charge to the end-user. The publisher's premiere titles,  PLoS Biology  and  PLoS Medicine , are intended to compete on quality with high-ranking weekly subscription journals such as  Nature ,  Science  and  The New England Journal of Medicine . An equal goal was to show that the economics of \u2018author pays\u2019 could be made to work, by making PLoS financially sustainable. But although  PLoS Biology  has achieved an impact factor of 14.7, a more than respectable score for a relatively new journal, an analysis of PLoS's accounts shows that the financial side of the business looks less rosy. As a US non-profit charity, PLoS must file its annual accounts to the Internal Revenue Service.  Nature  consulted these via GuideStar.org, a database that contains information on 1.5 million US non-profit organizations. The figures show that PLoS lost almost $1 million last year. Moreover, its total income from fees and advertising currently covers just 35% of its total costs. And although this income is increasing \u2014 from $0.75 million in 2003\u201304 to $0.9 million in 2004\u201305 \u2014 it lags far behind spending, which has soared from $1.5 million to around $5.5 million over the past three years. To stay afloat, the firm continues to rely on the philanthropic grants that launched the project: $9 million from the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation and $4 million from the Sandler Family Supporting Foundation, both based in San Francisco (see graphic). These covered 65% of the company's operating costs last year, but are running out: at the end of last September, PLoS had assets of $3,393,265. \u201cWe will continue to rely on philanthropic grant support for the foreseeable future,\u201d says Mark Patterson, director of publishing at PLoS's UK office in Cambridge, and \u201cpossibly always\u201d. Patterson adds that he is hopeful that the Sandler Foundation will provide more grants. \u201cThis demonstrates once again the fragility of the author-pays model,\u201d says David Worlock, chairman of the London-based publishing consultancy Electronic Publishing Services. (Worlock has worked with a number of publishing companies including Nature Publishing Group.) \u201cIt's a real giveaway if they are now saying that they will always need some philanthropic funding.\u201d But Patterson points out that PLoS launched most of its journals recently, and that income from these publications is only beginning to accrue. \u201cThe financial situation for this year will look quite different,\u201d he says. \u201cI'm confident we can balance the books this year and next.\u201d The three PLoS journals that launched last year \u2014  PLoS Computational Biology ,  PLoS Genetics  and  PLoS Pathogens  \u2014 are run by volunteer academic editorial teams, rather than in-house staff. This should help to ease the pressure on finances overall, explains Patterson, as they have lower editorial costs and are more likely to break even than  PLoS Biology  and  PLoS Medicine . In a further move towards high-volume publishing, PLoS intends to launch an open-access online database, called PLoS One, later this year. Papers published on the database will be peer reviewed only to check that they are technically sound, and not to assess novelty. The resource will publish \u201chundreds of papers per month\u201d, says Chris Surridge, its Cambridge-based managing editor, and pay for itself through fees and economies of scale. The diversification should help PLoS balance its books, agrees Matthew Cockerill, publisher of BioMed Central, a London-based open-access publisher. The high cost and low volume of articles in PLoS's flagship journals mean \u201cthey are not by themselves financially sustainable in isolation\u201d, he argues. BioMed Central, which last July increased its charges from $500 to as much as $1,700, depending on the journal, has also yet to break even. It is \u201cgetting close\u201d, says Cockerill, who declined to give an estimate of when break-even would occur: \u201cPredicting the future is not a wise activity to engage in.\u201d The hike in PLoS's fees, announced earlier this month, is due to take effect from 1 July. It is similarly intended to improve the firm's financial position by \u201creflecting more closely the costs of publication\u201d, according to a statement on the PLoS website announcing the increases. Author charges will rise to $2,500 for  PLoS Biology ,  PLoS Medicine  and  PLoS Clinical Trials  and to $2,000 for  PLoS Computational Biology ,  PLoS Genetics  and  PLoS Pathogens . When PLoS launched, other publishers expressed scepticism over its sustainability, arguing that the $1,500 fee was unrealistically low for covering the costs of producing a high-quality journal (see  Nature   425 , 554\u2013555; 2003). PLoS rejected this argument as coming from journals with a vested interest in maintaining the reader-pays status quo. It said the $1,500 figure was realistic and was based on a business plan thrashed out with publishing experts. \u201cFour years further on, we know a lot more,\u201d says Patterson. \n                     Experiments in publishing \n                   \n                     Britain decides 'open access' is still an open issue \n                   \n                     Societies take united stand on journal access \n                   \n                     Scientific publishing: Who will pay for open access? \n                   \n                     Nature  Peer Review Trial and Debate \n                   \n                     Access to the literature; the debate continues \n                   \n                     Public Library of Science \n                   \n                     PLoS on Guidestar (requires registration) \n                   \n                     BioMed Central \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

There's something fitting about the decision to site a bastion against the end of the world in a place that looks as if it has already experienced the apocalypse. On 19 June, a construction crew started work on a doomsday seed bank from which the genetic riches of Earth's food crops could, if necessary, be reconstituted. The location: the island of Spitsbergen in the Svalbard archipelago, a desolate place where the winters are long and dark, and polar bears outnumber people. The island's remoteness, say staff at the Global Crop Diversity Trust, a charitable organization based in Rome that has helped develop the bank, makes it the ideal location to store samples safely. Spitsbergen is free of tectonic activity, and its permafrost would preserve seeds at around \u22124 \u00b0C. Coal from a local mine will be used to power refrigeration units that will further cool the bank to the internationally recommended standard of \u221220 to \u221230 \u00b0C. \u201cIt's a resource that needs to last for ever,\u201d says Cary Fowler, the trust's director. Fowler says that such a bank is needed in case a species becomes extinct or loses genetic variety through overuse. Some of the three million seeds earmarked for storage could be called upon to thwart a new disease or drought, or even extinctions caused by nuclear war. Although other seed banks exist, the trust is developing the Spitsbergen facility because many banks are poorly maintained and face uncertain futures owing to funding problems. Norway, which administers Svalbard, will fund the US$3-million construction costs, and the trust will pay for its maintenance, which Fowler estimates at around $100,000 annually. The trust, which expects the facility to be completed by 2007, will also help developing countries prepare and transport seeds to the Arctic. The bank will be carved into one of the island's sandstone mountains, and will consist of a 50-metre tunnel leading to a storage facility reinforced with one-metre-thick concrete. Seeds will be wrapped in aluminium foil to keep out moisture. The cave will be protected by two high-security doors armed with motion detectors. No full-time staff will oversee the facility, says Fowler, because it is accessible only by an air-strip about three kilometres away, making it relatively easy to track people's comings and goings. \u201cIt's about providing long-term security for crop plants,\u201d says plant scientist Matthew Daws of the Millennium Seed Bank Project at Kew Gardens in London. \u201cIt's an insurance policy for countries to deposit some of their collection and have confidence that after thousands of years their seeds will be viable.\u201d \n                     The constant gardeners \n                   \n                     Plant science: Gardens in full bloom \n                   \n                     Global Crop Diversity Trust \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

A question to holders of grants from the National Institutes of Health (NIH): do you plan to submit publications resulting from NIH-funded research to PubMed Central?

That could be about to change. The archive is at the heart of plans, backed by a coalition of US politicians and advocacy groups, to make the fruits of publicly funded research freely available. On 13 June, a change was introduced to a House of Representatives spending bill such that NIH grantees would be required, not requested, to submit to PubMed within 12 months of publication. The proposal has upset some publishers and scientific societies, who are wary of citation confusion and a possible drop in income. The move is in part a response to the limited impact of NIH's current policy on open access. \u201cIt is not working in its current state,\u201d says Norka Ruiz Bravo, NIH deputy director for extramural research and an advocate of full participation in open-access publishing by all grantees. A majority of the NIH Public Access Working Group, an advisory body that includes publishers and researchers, have also endorsed mandatory submission to PubMed Central, says Thomas Detre, a psychiatrist at the University of Pittsburgh in Pennsylvania and chair of the working group: \u201cNobody in academia will do anything administrative that's not obligatory.\u201d But critics charge that such a policy could affect the integrity of the scientific literature. Some journals do not allow copyedited versions to be posted on PubMed Central. This means two versions of the same research paper can be published: a peer-reviewed manuscript version held in PubMed Central and a journal version complete with copyedits and other mostly cosmetic modifications. The PubMed Central version would also not necessarily link to the journal that published the paper. This would unfairly divert web traffic from the journal, and the multiple versions could confuse citation analyses, says Martin Frank, executive director of the American Physiological Society in Bethesda, Maryland. Such arguments could be addressed when the Senate drafts its appropriations bill, as some senators are likely to want to include a clause on mandatory submission. In May, for example, Joseph Lieberman and John Cornyn introduced a bill that would require that all federal US agency grantees with annual research budgets of more than $100 million make their research papers freely available within six months of publication ( Nature ,  441  -140; 2006). The Senate's spending bill could be introduced in July, although completion by the autumn is more likely. \n                     UK research councils claim success for open-access publishing plan \n                   \n                     NIH open-access plans draw fire from both sides \n                   \n                     All parties on edge as NIH delays open-access briefing \n                   \n                     NIH head stands firm over plans for open access \n                   \n                     Access to the literature; the debate continues \n                   \n                     PubMed Central \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

From the speed of light to the charge on an electron, the fundamental constants of physics had been assumed to be immutable. But that comfortable assumption is being challenged. The latest in a series of experiments to question this view suggests that over the past 12 billion years, the ratio of the mass of a proton to that of an electron may have decreased. The result has left physicists curious, sceptical, and more than a little stumped. Protons are about 1,836 times heavier than electrons. The exact mass ratio can be calculated by observing how a cloud of hydrogen molecules (each composed of two protons and two electrons) absorbs ultraviolet laser light. Wim Ubachs of the Free University in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, and his team have done just that, producing data hundreds of times more accurate than those obtained from previous experiments (see  Nature  doi:10.1038/news060417-7; 2006). Using the Very Large Telescope in Paranal, Chile, they compared their results obtained with hydrogen in the lab with observations of light from two distant quasars. This light shines through clouds of hydrogen around 12 billion light years away. The lab result was smaller by 0.002% (E. Reinhold  et al .  Phys. Rev. Lett.   96,  151101; 2006). A change of 20 parts per million over 12 billion years isn't large \u2014 \u201cnot jelly\u201d, as Andy Fabian of the University of Cambridge, UK, puts it. But it could point to previously unknown subtleties in the way the Universe is put together. Such an effect is not explained by anything in physicists' standard model of particle physics. The result has a confidence level of about 3.5-sigma, a statistical term that translates into a 0.3% possibility that it could be down to chance. That's good enough to be called an \u201cindication\u201d, says Ubachs, but for such an important potential result it is not a cast-iron observation. \u201cYou don't want to book a ticket to Stockholm on a 3.5-sigma result,\u201d chuckles John Webb, a physicist at the University of New South Wales in Sydney, Australia, who has also studied changes in the proton\u2013electron mass ratio. \u201cBut they've done the best job of anyone so far on comparing the proton and electron mass.\u201d The mass-ratio effect has until now received less attention than the fine-structure constant,  \u03b1 , a measure of the electromagnetic force that keeps electrons in place inside atoms and molecules. Webb has been at the forefront of efforts to probe whether or not the mass ratio changes over time (J. K. Webb  et al .  Phys. Rev. Lett.   87,  091301; 2001). He expects to publish his most detailed study later this year, which relies on light from many more quasars than used in previous analyses. But the work is controversial. Webb says he has been criticized by senior astrophysicists for even tackling the problem. \u201cIt's as though you're knocking a pillar of physics,\u201d he says. John Barrow, a cosmologist at the University of Cambridge, adds that astronomers are often more sceptical than physicists simply because they are more aware of how complicated \u2014 and potentially error-prone \u2014 quasar spectroscopy can be. Fabian is certainly cautious about Ubachs' result. \u201cExtraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence,\u201d he says, pointing out that many results at a similar confidence level turn out to be wrong. The most likely error source lies in assumptions about the behaviour of the distant hydrogen cloud, he says. Some parts of the cloud could be hotter or moving faster than other parts, and the hydrogen might be mixed with a smattering of other elements. Even if further studies do push the confidence level across the five-sigma threshold that physicists regard as convincing, the reason for the changed mass ratio is not understood, nor whether it is an ongoing effect. If true \u201cthe laws of physics as we currently understand them are incorrect at their very core,\u201d says Michael Murphy of the University of Cambridge, who works with Webb. \u201cA new set of physics laws must be found which explain the new observations.\u201d It is unlikely that protons are simply losing weight. But various versions of string theory suggest that extra dimensions occupied by a particle might affect properties such as its mass. Subtle changes in these dimensions could make physical constants vary slightly, explains Barrow. However, \u201cthere's absolutely no observational evidence to support this vast array of ideas,\u201d cautions Fabian. The paucity of hard evidence for string theory may be partly responsible for the upsurge in interest in variable constants, Barrow adds; results like Ubachs' could eventually provide a good way to assess the ideas. \u201cI'm sure we'll see some theory papers about this,\u201d he says. \u201cI might write one myself.\u201d Fabian agrees that the problem has been receiving more attention over the past few years, but that \u201cit's still a minority interest\u201d. The research needs intensive work on the very biggest telescopes, \u201ca large investment in something that could turn out to be zero\u201d. But he agrees that it is an important problem to tackle: \u201cLet's keep shaking the pillars to make sure they're rigid. \n                     Astrophysics: The inconstant constant? \n                   \n                     Lab tests tenets' limits \n                   \n                     Physicists better their time \n                   \n                     Physical sciences channel \n                   \n                     Laser Centre of the Free University, Amsterdam \n                   \n                     NIST introduction to physical constants \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

The issue is divisive not just because it challenges 50 years of scientific dogma. If women could generate new eggs it would have huge implications for fertility treatments, menopause, and even cell-based therapies. Last year, a controversial paper 1  by Jonathan Tilly and his colleagues at Harvard Medical School proposed that egg cells can arise from bone marrow and other circulating cells 2 . But Amy Wagers, also at Harvard Medical School, and her colleagues now report that this is not the case, at least for ovulated eggs 3 . Some critics think the new study proves Tilly's work was flawed, but Tilly and other experts say that some aspects of egg renewal remain open questions. Tilly's bone-marrow study drew loud criticism from others in the field, both in the press and the literature. But without experimental testing of the ideas, much of the disapproval rang hollow. Now, Wagers and her colleagues have addressed the bone-marrow hypothesis. \u201cThis is a pretty powerful denial of the idea that new eggs form and contribute to fertility,\u201d says co-author Roger Gosden of Cornell University's Weill Medical College in New York. Tilly's study found that a bone-marrow transplant from a donor mouse expressing a green fluorescent marker called GFP in all its cells resulted in green eggs \u2014 presumably newly generated \u2014 in the ovary of a normal mouse recipient. To test that idea, Gosden and Wagers linked the circulatory systems of paired mice \u2014 one normal, and one with GFP. After several months, the researchers induced ovulation in both animals. Normal mice ovulated only normal eggs; GFP mice ovulated only green eggs, showing that there had been no exchange of egg-generating stem cells. \u201cIt incontestably shows that the Tilly work was simply not true,\u201d says ovarian researcher David Albertini of the University of Kansas Medical Center in Kansas City. Echoing that sentiment, reproductive biologist Evelyn Telfer at University of Edinburgh, UK, is also unconvinced by Tilly's data, adding that the story changes as new data come in. \u201cScience is supposed to be a moving target,\u201d retorts Tilly. \u201cWhether our data are repeatable is valid, but no one as yet has disproved any of our data.\u201d Tilly has several technical issues with the Wagers study, but he is most disturbed by the comparison of his work, which examined the pool of immature egg cells inside the ovary, to this study, which examines ovulated eggs outside the ovary. He argues that circulating stem cells may still become immature egg cells inside the ovary. Such immature cells, he points out, are critical to fertility and hormonal balance, even if they are never ovulated. And he stands by the bone-marrow connection, pointing to additional experimental data from his group currently under review. \n               Embryonic idea \n             Albertini says this explanation is \u201clooking to keep something of the original idea alive\u201d. He and other critics question why regeneration would occur in the immature but not the ovulated population of cells: \u201cIt's a bit of a stretch.\u201d But several other experts agree that because Wagers's study did not examine immature cells inside the ovary, it leaves room for possible regeneration and the hunt for the responsible stem cells. But even if that were the case, all admit that it is a huge leap to suggest that the same happens in humans. For now, regeneration in mice \u201cis still an open issue\u201d, says Jeff Kerr of Monash University in Clayton, Australia. At least, \u201cuntil someone comes up with some killer experiments to prove that bone marrow, or the ovary, is, or is not, the source of new oocytes\u201d. Kerr, Jock Findlay and colleagues add a piece of support for regeneration in research to be published online later this month 4 . They found that the mouse strain used by Tilly and Wagers maintains a steady pool of oocyte numbers from before puberty into middle age, rather than the number declining with age as the dogma holds. Whether that is due to regeneration is unknown, says Kerr, but such a possibility would not be \u201ccompletely out of left field\u201d. Even Gosden, one of Tilly's more vocal critics, leaves the door open to the possibility of regenerative, albeit dormant, egg stem cells. \u201cOur work suggests they do not contribute to new ovulations, but perhaps under special circumstances they could be brought back to life [in the lab dish],\u201d he says. \u201cI think the Tilly group might be right to some extent on that one.\u201d Reprints and Permissions"},

A ten-member committee composed of ministry officials and researchers will choose the relevant journals. They are likely to include  Nature ,  Science  and  Cell  among others, Lim says. Similar practices are already in place elsewhere. In Pakistan, under a system introduced by the science ministry in 2002, researchers can receive $1,000 to $20,000, based mainly on the cumulative one-year impact factor of their publications. Half is given as a research grant and the rest for personal use. In China, bonuses are left up to the individual institution. China Agricultural University in Beijing, for example, will pay up to $50,000 for high-impact papers, says its president Zhang-liang Chen. \u201cThis is not a big deal for great papers,\u201d he says. The Chinese Academy of Sciences' Institute of Biophysics in Beijing has a scale tuned to impact factors. Authors published in journals with an impact factor between 3 and 5 receive 2,000 yuan ($250) per point, while a factor over 10 earns 7,000 yuan ($875) per point. A paper in  Nature ,  Science  or  Cell  earns 250,000 yuan ($31,000). The institute has had several such papers published over the past few years. Advocates of the bonus schemes say that the incentives compensate for the low academic wages in the countries concerned. A bonus of $1,000, for instance, could be three times the monthly salary of a Pakistani university lecturer. Thanks partly to the incentives, the output of papers has increased dramatically, says Atta-ur-Rahman, chairman of the Pakistan government's higher education commission, who helped introduce the reward system. But critics charge that more papers aren't necessarily better. \u201cThe bonus plan has had a devastating effect,\u201d says Pervez Hoodbhoy, a physicist at Quaid-i-Azam University in Islamabad. \u201cUniversity researchers are rushing to publish by hook or by crook, and scientific and academic ethics are ignored in this haste.\u201d He suspects that many papers with little significance are churned out, and says that bonuses could be adding to the problems of plagiarism and faked data that he has seen and heard. Others feel that the bonus system belittles their work. \u201cGood papers are the product of sweat, joy and sorrow,\u201d says Sunyoung Kim, a biologist at South Korea's Seoul National University. \u201cIf this is calculated to be 3 million won, I feel insulted.\u201d Yuan Tseh Lee, a Nobel prize-winning chemist, agrees. \u201cThere is too much pressure on scientists to get recognition in China,\u201d says Lee, who is president of Taiwan's Academia Sinica. \u201cIf you just aim for fame and money, you will make yourself and your students miserable.\u201d Partly because of such concerns, the Shanghai Institute of Biological Sciences cancelled its bonus program in 2003. But Chen argues that at the moment bonuses are necessary, especially in China where a socialist system has made it difficult to reward hard work. \u201cIt's a necessary stage,\u201d he says. \u201cIn ten years I'm sure the situation will be different.\u201d Peter Cotgreave, director of the London-based lobby group the Campaign for Science and Engineering in the UK, says reward systems have some merit, in part because the people effectively judging the award \u2014 anonymous peer reviewers \u2014 are independent of the award. Deserving researchers might miss out, he says, when, for example, high-quality papers are rejected by top journals. But he doubts that poor work would be rewarded, as researchers \u201conly win if they are good enough to get into  Nature  or  Science \u201d. \n                     Time for 'enlightened moderation' \n                   \n                     Korean Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST) \n                   \n                     Ministry of Science and Technology in Pakistan \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Washington DC Climate scientists are scrambling to find new backers for atmospheric sensors they had hoped would fly on board a US military\u2013civilian polar satellite system. Last week, government officials scrubbed three planned instruments \u2014 which would have measured key climate variables \u2014 in an effort to get the long-troubled project back on budget and schedule. First proposed in 1994, the National Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System (NPOESS) had been touted as a one-stop shop for both military and civilian needs to gather data on global weather. It was meant to save money and avoid duplication between three government agencies \u2014 the US Department of Defense, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and NASA. Originally slated to cost US$6.5 billion and launch in 2008, the project is going to cost upwards of US$11 billion and will not launch until at least 2013. Under the new design, the programme \u201cwill have fewer satellites and less sensors, while costing more money\u201d, NOAA administrator Conrad Lautenbacher told a congressional hearing on 8 June. The cutbacks come as part of a defence department review of the programme, required by law because it was so far over budget. Five key sensors have been temporarily removed, three of which are related to climate science. \u201cThey decided to de-scope everything not related to short-term weather forecasting,\u201d says programme scientist P. K. Bhartia, who works on an ozone sensor for the satellites. \u201cAt this point, we're really confused as to what will happen.\u201d If industry, a university or a research agency decides to pay for the instruments directly, they \u2014 or stripped-down versions of them \u2014 may be placed back onto the NPOESS satellites. In the meantime, climate scientists are left wondering whether their sensors will ever get to fly. \u201cAbsolutely, we're quite disappointed,\u201d says Ron Isaacs, executive vice-president of the Massachusetts-based company Atmospheric Environmental Research, which helped design another sensor that was axed. That instrument, Isaacs says, would have served some unique functions, such as measuring soil moisture. The European Meteop satellites could work with NPOESS satellites to obtain some of the necessary data. But US officials are concerned about how much of the data would actually be shared \u2014 especially information useful for the military. Still, many in Congress support the NPOESS programme, even as it balloons in cost. \u201cWe have to make this work,\u201d says congressman Sherwood Boehlert (Republican, New York), chairman of the House Committee on Science. \u201cAt some point that word \u2018operational\u2019 has to mean more than adding a vowel to the acronym.\u201d \n                     America's merged satellite system hits stormy weather \n                   \n                     The National Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System (NPOESS) \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

As the World Cup kicks off in Germany, mathematicians say they have proved one of soccer's classic clich\u00e9s \u2014 the idea that when a team scores, the resulting confidence boost helps players romp to victory with a flurry of goals. Although often seen as wishful thinking rather than football fact, such goal fever can be seen in football results stretching back decades, says mathematician Martin Weigel of Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh, UK. Much research has been geared towards improving tactics and understanding fan behaviour, but little has been done on factors affecting the distribution of final scores. Small studies carried out since the 1950s have generally assumed that a team has a set chance of scoring in a game \u2014 this depends on various factors and remains roughly constant throughout a match. This produces a \u2018normal\u2019 distribution of final scores, like a symmetrical bell-curve. But when Weigel and his colleagues at Germany's University of Leipzig examined results from the German men's and women's league (about 22,000 games) and from the finals of all previous World Cup tournaments (3,400 matches), they found that the scores didn't fit such a distribution: high-scoring games happened far too often. This suggests that teams don't simply score a number of goals proportional to their skill, but rather are spurred on to greater heights after they score. The researchers designed a model in which a team's chances of scoring are multiplied for every goal, and found that it fitted the skewed distribution of final scores perfectly (E. Bittner, A. Nussbaumer, W. Janke & M. Weigel; preprint available at  http://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0606016 ). The effect is more noticeable in lower-standard leagues than in the World Cup finals, probably because in higher-quality games teams are more evenly matched and so less likely to gain a psychological upper hand. But the boost gained from scoring is likely to be stronger in football, where goals are relatively rare, than in rugby or basketball, say, where both teams would expect to score reasonably often. Similar effects can be found in other fields, however. Statisticians refer to situations where the outcome of one experiment influences the outcome of following ones as \u2018contagious distributions\u2019. This has been seen with accidents, for example, where one mishap can make someone feel insecure and more likely to suffer further calamities.

Replicating controversial lab results or tricky methods could become easier, thanks to a new breed of websites where scientists share and edit each other's laboratory techniques. Laboratory protocols in biology and chemistry \u2014 the step-by-step guide to, say, separating proteins or splicing DNA fragments \u2014 are conventionally published in research papers or books of standard protocols. The instructions should allow another researcher to copy and confirm an experiment. But scientists know that these recipes are seldom enough. Journals are cutting their methods sections to save money. And printed protocols lag behind rapidly evolving and increasingly sophisticated techniques, such as the nuclear transfer used in cloning. Perhaps more importantly, it is the subtle variations \u2014 the deftness of touch, the type of mixing tube, and a dash of hocus-pocus \u2014 that distinguish a successful experiment from a flop. But such details often exist only as scrawled footnotes or collective laboratory wisdom. \u201cThe art of the science really is not present in many of these protocols,\u201d says geneticist Garry Nolan of Stanford University, California, who has put his protocols online. \u201cThey don't tell people what the voodoo is.\u201d The websites could help share the voodoo. They are loosely based on the online encyclopaedia Wikipedia, which lets users edit each other's entries. Unlike the protocols already available online, the idea is to create a repository of experiments and the tricks needed to do them, and allow users to add their own. One burgeoning site, OpenWetWare, was set up just over a year ago by students at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The Wikipedia-style site, featuring methods and other scientific resources, had around 30,000 users last month. One of the most popular protocols, used to measure the level of protein production in cells, now includes experimental data posted by users to let others know what to expect. \u201cYou can't find this information anywhere else,\u201d says one of OpenWetWare's founders, Sriram Kosuri, a graduate student in synthetic biology. The site is particularly popular among researchers in synthetic biology, who want to create standard tools for engineering biological systems. Two other competing sites are starting up. One, from the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, launched last week, and one, from the Nature Publishing Group, publisher of  Nature , is due to launch in June. Both will feature commissioned protocols, which users will be able to comment on and add to. Unlike Wikipedia, comments will be screened before they are published and some of the material will be available only to subscribers. Advocates say the sites have several advantages. They help busy lab heads deal with enquiries about their protocols. By removing some of the mystery from methods, they could help researchers iron out flaws, and perhaps verify controversial results. They might also raise the profile of methods, often glossed over as the means to the more exciting results. On the flip side, a laboratory worker could end up drowning in information. And the sites will be successful only if enough scientists embrace them. Researchers in competitive fields might hold back methods that they think give them an edge. \u201cA lot of molecular biologists are not very comfortable on the Internet to begin with,\u201d says systems biologist Pamela Silver of Harvard Medical School, who uses OpenWetWare. And even the sites' supporters admit that a written protocol still cannot compare to learning on the job from a lab veteran. \u201cThe very best way,\u201d says John Inglis, executive director of the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, \u201cis to sit beside someone who's doing it.\u201d \n                     Internet encyclopaedias go head to head \n                   \n                     Wiki's wild world \n                   \n                     Science in the web age: Joint efforts \n                   \n                     Electronic notebooks: A new leaf \n                   \n                     Nature Protocols prelaunch \n                   \n                     OpenWetWare \n                   \n                     Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Sydney Australia's biggest research organization has faced tough questioning in the national parliament over its financial management after it had to reduce its estimates of future external earnings. But the organization says the fall is just a blip caused by legal tussles over its intellectual property and the fact that much of its income is now in the form of people and equipment rather than cash. The Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) has a turnover of nearly Aus$1billion (US$750 million), two-thirds of which comes from the government. Earnings from non-governmental sources, such as industry, are estimated to fall by nearly Aus$184 million over the next four years \u2014 a humbling blow, critics say, to chief executive Geoff Garrett, who had pledged to boost such external revenue. The opposition Labor party also attacked the agency, at a parliamentary hearing on 31 May, for frittering away funds on entertainment and the chief executive's home renovations. \u201cThe Australian community is rightly asking: what's going on with CSIRO?\u201d says Jenny Macklin, Labor's shadow minister for science. \u201cIt's time we got an answer.\u201d This bad publicity for the agency follows earlier criticism of its controversial diet book and accusations that its climate scientists were prevented from speaking out about climate change (see  Nature   439 , 896\u2013897; 200610.1038/439896b ). But CSIRO management has hit back, arguing that there are sound reasons for the revised forecasts. About Aus$121 million of the shortfall is due to delays in earning money from the agency's patents, it says. Legal cases over patent infringement, including a battle with information-technology giants Microsoft, Dell and Hewlett-Packard over a patent on wireless technology, are partly to blame. \u201cUntil we know the outcomes of those legal cases, we have recalibrated so as not to take into account revenue from those sources,\u201d says CSIRO's chief finance officer, Mike Whelan. \u201cWhen we know the outcomes, we will revise the estimates.\u201d Officials say the rest of the shortfall results from industry giving people or lab equipment, rather than cash, to collaborative research programmes. Whelan says this practice is increasing and isn't counted as revenue. Of the Aus$750,000 spent on renovating the chief executive's abode in Canberra, CSIRO officials say it was entirely reasonable to renovate the \u201crun-down\u201d building, which is heritage-listed, and to transform it from offices into a liveable residence. They also took umbrage at accusations of corporate excess after it was revealed that the organization racked up a Aus$1.4-million \u2018hospitality\u2019 bill in the past financial year. According to Whelan, most of the money was spent on scientific conferences and meetings to plan research. \u201cIt's not about executives going off to restaurants and drinking top-shelf wine,\u201d says Whelan. \u201cIt involves bringing scientific collaborators together \u2014 and, yes, sometimes we give them a cup of tea.\u201d Staff morale, already low according to annual staff surveys, may dip further with these recent developments, says Michael Borgas, president of CSIRO's staff association. CSIRO has undergone significant changes since Garrett took the helm in January 2001, with more priority-driven research and pressure for commercial outcomes. The biggest concern, according to Borgas, is that the organization may be pushing ahead too quickly before having successfully persuaded staff of the need for change. Notably, no staff survey is being conducted this year. Perhaps most galling for staff \u2014 who face more job cuts over the next few years \u2014 is the revelation that Garrett earns Aus$478,980 a year, whereas senior researchers' wages typically fall below Aus$100,000. And, according to Labor, more CSIROsenior executives than ever are earning over Aus$300,000. \n                     Culture of fear reigns at Australian research lab \n                   \n                     Diet book attacked for its high-protein advice \n                   \n                     Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation \n                   \n                     CSIRO's budget portfolio statement \n                   \n                     CSIRO's response to Senate \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

A US federal court has shut down a research programme on the endangered Steller sea lion, ruling that studies \u2014 including the branding of pups \u2014 were inadequately monitored and could harm the animals. The 26 May ruling scuppers the plans of groups of researchers who intended to study the sea lions ( Eumetopias jubatus ) this summer from Oregon to Alaska. Last year, the Humane Society of the United States, an animal-welfare group based in Washington DC, sued the US National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), alleging that the agency failed to monitor and analyse studies worth more than $120 million begun in 2001 (see  Nature   436 , 315; 200510.1038/436315a ). In her ruling, Judge Ellen Huvelle determined that the NMFS \u201carbitrarily and capriciously\u201d failed to do so. Sharon Young, the humane society's marine issues field director, says the organization sued to force the NMFS to assess the environmental impact of the research. \u201cThis lawsuit was about conducting good science by coordinating and designing valid studies,\u201d she says. \u201cWe are disappointed in the ruling, but we respect it,\u201d says NMFS spokeswoman Susan Buchanan. Agency officials say they have already begun the impact assessment, which will take at least another year. This summer, biologists planned to \u2018hot brand\u2019 2,900 Steller pups, identifying them for later observation. Air surveys and collection of blood and other samples were planned. All fieldwork is now blocked. Kate Wynne, a biologist at the University of Alaska, is disappointed with the halt to branding, which is, she says, \u201ca valuable tool\u201d. Federal records that emerged during the lawsuit show that at least eight pups died after a branding expedition in 2001, which exceeds the allowed five accidental deaths. The NMFS attributed one death to that study. About 500 pups were born in the study area that year. Roy Lowe, a refuge manager with the US Fish and Wildlife Service, says his team was worried about how many sea lions were dying. He later limited studies to alternate years, and this year turned down an NMFS request to brand and tag on the Oregon coast. In April, the NMFS took the rare action of fining Randall Davis, a physiologist at Texas A&M University in Galveston, $6,666 and denying him research permits until next year. He was accused of using an unapproved anaesthetic on Alaskan Stellers and of improperly conducted studies of pups in 2003 and 2004. Davis could not be reached for comment. \u201cMany of the scientists have themselves to blame for this,\u201d says Young. \u201cThey need to look in the mirror, and hold themselves to the same standards they hold others to.\u201d \n                     Animal-rights group sues over 'disturbing' work on sea lions \n                   \n                     Conservation biology: Is this any way to save a species? \n                   \n                     NOAA recovery plan \n                   \n                     NMFS Steller sea lion research \n                   \n                     The Human Society of the United States \n                   \n                     Alaska SeaLife Center \n                   \n                     Oregon National Wildlife Refuge Complex \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Federally funded US researchers were supplied with a prohibited stem-cell line, disguised as an approved line by researchers at Seoul's MizMedi hospital. Allegations that a cell line had been switched surfaced earlier this month (see  Nature   441 , 680; 2006). Sung-il Roh, chairman of the board of trustees at MizMedi Women's Hospital, has now admitted to Nature that this was indeed the case. Research with the unapproved cell line has been halted. But the incident highlights how hard it is for researchers to know what they are working with. And in this case the problem was not only scientific but political: US president George W. Bush announced in 2001 that because of ethical concerns over human embryonic stem cells, only such cell lines established before 9 August 2001 would be eligible for federally funded research. One line established by researchers at MizMedi Hospital, Miz-hES1, was created before that date, and approved by the US National Institutes of Health (NIH). But the cell line sent out in its place, Miz-hES5, was created later. The NIH has paid the hospital US$930,000 since 2002 to grow, characterize and distribute Miz-1. But Roh told  Nature  that in December 2003, researchers at the hospital identified a chromosomal abnormality in that line. In April 2004 they switched to Miz-5, but pretended they were shipping Miz-1. The subterfuge came to light during the police investigation into the research fraud committed by cloning expert Woo Suk Hwang (see  Nature   439 , 122; 200610.1038/439122a ). The human eggs used by Hwang were harvested at MizMedi. Roh admitted in November 2005 to paying for the eggs that he passed to Hwang, despite previously claiming they were from volunteers. Roh says he knew nothing about the stem-cell switch, and only found out from the police report. But he says: \u201cIt's a healthy line. From a research perspective, it wouldn't cause any trouble.\u201d According to Roh, around 80 Korean groups and more than 30 foreign groups were shipped the Miz-1 line. NIH spokesman John Burklow says three dozen US researchers received what they thought was Miz-1. But Roh says about 16 groups were shipped Miz-5 disguised as Miz-1. The NIH has suspended research on MizMedi's cell line, and insists no one used it in federally funded work. But the episode raises the question of what can be done to ensure the integrity of stem-cell lines. James Battey, head of the NIH Stem Cell Task Force, says that when the agency receives a stem-cell line, it checks that the cells have normal chromosomes, are free of contamination, and replicate in culture. These tests confirm a line's health but do not check its identity. As the two MizMedi lines were both male, \u2018the NIH would have no easy way of knowing that Miz-5 was substituted for Miz-1\u2019, he says. Extensive DNA analysis would tell cell lines apart but is time-consuming, and reference information for the original line is often not available. Scientists at the Burnham Institute for Medical Research in La Jolla, California, working with a large group from the NIH and the DNA-analysis company Illumina of San Diego, have recently made a dent in this problem. The work was spearheaded by Mahendra Rao, who left the NIH in October 2005 and is now at the company Invitrogen. While at the NIH, Rao offered to perform detailed genetic profiles of all president-approved stem-cell lines for free. He says suppliers weren't always eager to share their resources, but he has analysed the lines he could get agreements on, using bead-based microarrays developed by Illumina to compare single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Rao has published his analysis of 7 of 22 cell lines included in the NIH registry ( http://www.biomedcentral.com/content/pdf/1471-213x-6-20.pdf ), and says a paper in press covers ten more. Rao says a quick, cheap profiling method is essential: \u201cYou need to know what you are working with, because mix-ups are possible.\u201d The NIH says it knows of no other cases of deliberate fraud, but there have been accidental switches. Rao says he uncovered a case in which a US company was shipping out wrongly identified cells after a technician accidentally mislabelled vials: \u201cWe were able to inform the few people who got the mislabelled line.\u201d SNP analysis also reveals the genetic basis of different cell types. The work heralds a breakthrough in that respect, says Burnham's Evan Snyder: \u201cOnly now is the research evolving to the point where people are starting to profile these lines and compare them.\u201d Reprints and Permissions"},

Mark Peplow and Emma Marris investigate whether chemistry deserves its reckless reputation. Something that felt like an earthquake hit the French town of Mulhouse on 24 March. The explosion at the National Institution of Higher Learning in Chemistry (ENSCMu) killed Dominique Burget, a 41-year-old photochemist. It also sent ripples of concern around the world. Although official investigations are expected to last until the end of the year, it appears that residues of the flammable gas ethene in a pressure vessel were responsible. Burget was working in the lab above the explosion and had nothing to do with the experiment, which also severely injured a 19 year-old student in the room next door. \u201cShe is now out of danger and comes back to the school next week,\u201d Serge Neunlist, director of ENSCMu, said on 23 May. The explosion caused roughly \u20ac10 million (US$130 million) of damage and destroyed about 4,000 m 2  of the building, which will take at least three years to rebuild. Chemistry's reputation for big bangs might suggest that Mulhouse was no freak accident. Gather any group of chemists together and before long they are likely to be exchanging stories about heart-stopping near-misses or discussing someone involved in a serious accident. Is chemistry really so dangerous? Those responsible for the safety of research labs say such stories may perpetuate out-of-date myths. \u201cA lot of it is reminiscence to \u2018the good old days\u2019 of chemistry,\u201d says Alan Kendall, safety officer at the University of Oxford, UK. \u201cThere's a public perception that is years behind the reality,\u201d agrees Richard Firn, a biologist who chairs the laboratory safety committee at the University of York, UK. \u201cThings have changed a lot in the past 10 to 15 years.\u201d Swathes of occupational-health legislation in the 1970s, which established, for example, the US government's Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and the UK Health and Safety Executive (HSE), have spurred the change in culture. One of the most important factors is that risk assessment is now built into scientists' routines. Each chemical used comes with a list of potential risks and appropriate safety precautions, although unpredicted toxicity can affect even the most careful chemist, as Karen Wetterhahn found to her cost in 1996 (see  \u2018Cautionary tales\u2019 ). And practices such as eating lunch at the bench, mouth pipetting and washing hands with benzene (now known to be a carcinogen) have largely been consigned to history \u2014 apart from the odd emeritus professor reluctant to change methods that they have used for decades. Better analytical techniques also mean that reactions can be run on much smaller scales, significantly reducing the danger, says Lawrence Gibbs, associate vice-provost for environmental health and safety at Stanford University, California. \u201cAcademic institutions are now much more safety-conscious than when I was a student during the 1940s,\u201d agrees Edward Arnett, emeritus professor of chemistry at Duke University, Durham, North Carolina, and chair of the National Academy of Sciences research panel that penned the classic  Prudent Practices in the Laboratory: Handling and Disposal of Chemicals . \u201cI call that the kamikaze era of laboratory safety,\u201d he says. \u201cThe thing that radicalized me on safety was when I got a job with a small company in Philadelphia,\u201d he recalls. \u201cI took over my job a couple of days after they buried my predecessor, who died of hydrofluoric acid poisoning. It was my job to make sure nothing like that ever happened again.\u201d Yet despite the increase in legislation, it is surprisingly difficult to get national statistics on scientific accidents. In the United Kingdom and United States, for example, universities are obliged to report upwards only those accidents with serious consequences, such as hospitalization. This means that national agencies can remain oblivious to potentially major incidents if no one was seriously injured. And they do not tend to keep figures for different fields \u2014 the HSE, for example, groups all its accident figures for schools, colleges and universities into a single number, making it difficult to discern safety trends or to tell if one type of lab is more risky than another. Having a national register of accidents would be \u201cimmensely useful\u201d, says Sara Cooper, director of health and safety at the University of Cambridge, UK. Because officials at the HSE are responsible for writing the codes of practice that university labs have to follow, \u201cthey need to understand, sector by sector, what we have to cope with\u201d, she argues. It is possible to glean some information by talking to individual universities, however. Most accidents on campus involve trips and falls, like any workplace. Firn adds that most student injuries come from playing sports, while stress is by far the major cause of ill-health in universities. In labs, safety officers contacted by  Nature  agreed that chemistry generates the most accident reports. However, the vast majority of these involve undergraduates cutting themselves on glassware. Ian Gillett, safety director at Imperial College London, cautions that such evidence may reveal little about the inherent dangers of chemistry. He points out that chemistry involves more practical work than other disciplines, chemists may be more vigilant about accidents than others, and in any case it is impossible to gauge how many minor disasters go unreported. \u201cI don't feel that there is a significant difference between chemistry labs and other labs,\u201d agrees Gibbs, pointing out that biology, for example, carries its own set of risks, namely infection. Others agree that the risk of infection is often underplayed compared with that of chemical accidents. \u201cPeople's risk perception is skewed by the drama of an explosion,\u201d says Firn. Gillett adds that the most serious lab accidents at Imperial have involved accidental infections with hepatitis A and vaccinia virus. \u201cPathogens are where I would be more anxious about what's going on,\u201d he says. But what does seem clear is that academic labs are more dangerous than those in industry, with a more relaxed approach to safety. \u201cWe find that the accident rate [in universities] is 10 to 50 times greater than in the chemical industry,\u201d says James Kaufman, president of the Laboratory Safety Institute in Natick, Massachusetts. \u201cIn DuPont, if a guy hits his thumb with a hammer in Singapore, the chairman of the board has a report on his desk,\u201d he says. \u201cImagine if that happened in academia.\u201d \u201cIn industry we often say that we are surprised more people aren't injured in academic labs,\u201d agrees Derek Lowe, a research chemist who blogs on \u201cIn the pipeline\u201d ( http://www.corante.com/pipeline ). \u201cIn universities, people are still learning, and people work all hours. If you are there alone at three in the morning, that's seen as a good thing.\u201d Martin Pitt, compiler of  Bretherick's Handbook of Reactive Chemical Hazards , says that although risks have been much reduced in recent decades, there are still two key areas where academic labs could do a lot better. \u201cLabs are too crowded,\u201d he says, and such overcrowding raises the risk of spills. Waste disposal is the other major issue. Most chemistry labs have open bottles where solvents are dumped along with the black gunk left from failed reactions. \u201cIt's virtually impossible to say what will happen in these mixtures,\u201d says Pitt. Such arrangements also make it too easy for people to dump noxious chemicals \u2014and responsibility for them \u2014 in a communal spot. \n                     Micro lab makes cheap PET scan ingredient \n                   \n                     https://doi.org/10.1038/4361082a \n                   \n                     https://doi.org/10.1038/nj7002-948a \n                   \n                     Physical science channel \n                   \n                     Occupational Safety and Health Administration \n                   \n                     Health and Safety Executive \n                   \n                     University Safety and Health Association \n                   \n                     Campus Safety Health and Environmental Management Association \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Munich Insurance companies, acutely aware of the dramatic increase in losses caused by natural disasters in recent decades, have been convinced that global warming is partly to blame. Now their data seem to be persuading scientists, too. At a recent meeting of climate and insurance experts, delegates reached a cautious consensus: climate change is helping to drive the upward trend in catastrophes. The meeting, held near Munich on 25\u201326 May, was jointly organized by Munich Re, the world's largest reinsurance company, and the University of Colorado in Boulder. It brought together climate, atmosphere and weather researchers with economists and insurance experts to discuss what could be behind recent disaster losses, both economic and human. Insurers have been outspoken in blaming global warming. But scientists have tended to be more cautious, with many arguing that the rise could be primarily due to socioeconomic changes and natural climate variability. Under discussion were data compiled by Munich Re, whose NatCatservice database, comprising 22,000 natural disasters dating back to ad 79, is the largest of its kind. NatCatservice shows that the frequency of weather-related catastrophes has increased sixfold since the 1950s. The number of non-weather disasters, such as earthquakes, tsunamis and volcanic eruptions, has only marginally increased during the same period. Delegates seem to have found the record persuasive. Their consensus statement, to be released on 8 June, says there is \u201cevidence that changing patterns of extreme events are drivers for recent increases in global losses\u201d. There was no agreement on how big a role global warming has played, however. \u201cBecause of issues related to data quality, it is still not possible to determine the portion of the increase in damages that might be attributed to climate change,\u201d the workshop concluded. \u201cDissent over the issue is clearly waning,\u201d says Peter H\u00f6ppe, head of Munich Re's Geo Risks department, who co-chaired the workshop with Roger Pielke Jr, director of the University of Colorado's Center of Science and Technology Policy Research. \u201cClimate change may not be the dominant factor, but it has become clear that a relevant portion of damages can be attributed to global warming.\u201d Previously sceptical, Pielke says that he is now convinced that at least some of the increased losses can be blamed on climate: \u201cClearly, since 1970 climate change has shaped the disaster loss record.\u201d He adds a note of caution, however: \u201cDisaster damage is not the place to look for early indications of climate change,\u201d he says. \u201cPolicy advocates should exercise caution in using disaster losses to justify climate mitigation, lest they go beyond what science can support.\u201d But environmental groups are already using the rise in extreme weather events to help their campaigns about climate change. For example, Germanwatch, an environmental and developmental watchdog group, has used the Munich Re data to compile a ranking of the countries most badly affected by weather-related disasters in 2004. The group ranked countries according to four indicators \u2014 the number of casualties from extreme weather events, the number of casualties per 100,000 population, total economic damages, and economic damages relative to the country's gross domestic product. It combined those rankings to give a final \u201cclimate risk index\u201d. The ranking is topped by Somalia and other underdeveloped countries. But the United States and Japan, where natural disasters in 2004 caused considerable economic losses, also ranked highly. The list has been criticized by experts, who say that data for a single year are largely influenced by random events and reveal little about how climate change is affecting different countries. But Sven Anem\u00fcller, co-author of the report and senior adviser for climate and development with Germanwatch, counters that the 2004 list is just the beginning of a longer-term analysis. \u201cWe're not saying that the countries listed this time are the ones that will lastingly be hit hardest by climate change,\u201d he says. The group's approach, if continued, does make sense, agrees H\u00f6ppe. Looking at the rankings over years or decades could eventually provide much-needed information as to which countries are most at risk from climate change, he says. \n                     Meteorology: Bad weather ahead \n                   \n                     Tempers flare at hurricane meeting \n                   \n                     Natural disasters: The chaos to come \n                   \n                     Hurricane link to climate change is hazy \n                   \n                     Regional climate change special \n                   \n                     Climate change in focus \n                   \n                     Munich RE Group \n                   \n                     Center for Science and Technology Policy Research \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

The report goes beyond explaining the geology and blames penny-pinching for much of the chaos. \n               What was your role in the team? \n             I supervised characterization of the failure sites \u2014 drilling holes and recreating the foundation conditions. I also had responsibility for historical research on the background of the structures: how the New Orleans flood-protection system has evolved since 1718. Both overwhelming tasks, believe me. \n               What was it like working in New Orleans? \n             It was like pictures you see of Hiroshima and Nagasaki after the Second World War. Just complete devastation for mile after mile. No people, no bathrooms, no water. Choking dust; very fine dust on everything. The drilling was very difficult. A drill rig took six hours to get out of Baton Rouge, through all the traffic. Just horrible. There were lots of gawkers driving by. And constant media coverage. Sometimes I'd be talking to the grad students and I'd find my words on the front of New Orleans'  Times-Picayune  the next morning. I had so many people asking me to opine on things long before the analysis had even gotten going. They wanted to know, why? Who do I blame? \n               What went wrong with the levees? \n             We don't think that everything was due to overtopping. We feel a lot more of it was seepage related. When the storm hit, water was forced under the structures, eroding their bases and knocking them down. What was really unusual about drilling down there is how permeable the swamp deposits are. I've drilled in the Dead Sea, I've been all over the world and I have never seen anything like the swamp mucks underneath New Orleans. I would be pushing a tube sampler down one hole and 30 feet away water comes squirting up my old bore-holes. The flow of water through this permeable ground should be cut off by large metal sheets that extend deep into the ground underneath the levees. But a lot of the sheet piles did not extend far enough. Had those sheet piles been just 5 feet deeper, a lot of the failures wouldn't have happened \u2014 that's how close they were. The thing is, you can't just use one average depth for the whole structure, you have to keep evaluating the foundation every foot. Bad assumptions were made in a few places, where the geology dipped down, and they didn't get the cut-off deep enough. When we looked at the records we saw an increasing drive towards economy in the past 20 years. It would appear that they tried to do more for less, and they saved money, but they sacrificed a lot on safety. I found the guy who drew the cross-section that was wrong on 17th Street, I actually tracked him down. He feels horrible. He was told to draw the line where he did. He says he was told to average it. People were generally hired, fired and promoted based on one thing: whether they brought their projects in on time and on budget. \n               So who is to blame? \n             There is plenty of blame at all levels, right up to the executive branch. It is very disappointing that the decision-makers have a difficult time appreciating probabilistic risk assessment. When we tell them, as scientists, that something has a 25\u201340% chance of happening, that seems like a low chance to a lay-person. To us, that seems a huge risk. In my opinion, key decisions seem to have been made by people whose principal concerns were economy and timing, not safety. The local levy boards and the sewage and water boards down there are constantly at cross-purposes. Instead of working out compromises they engage in costly litigation, and these boards tend to be staffed by political appointees, not people with appropriate technical expertise. On the flight home I'd just think, is there anybody with a brain down there overseeing the big picture? It is scary. We need real experts to advise the president and Congress on long-term stuff and crisis response. National Guard generals aren't sufficient to respond to a tsunami, earthquake or flood. They don't have experience working with these things. \n               The hurricane season starts on 1 June. Are we ready? \n             No, the band-aids won't be completed until 30 June. Not for lack of trying \u2014 it was just too much damage. But the whole system needs to be re-evaluated, because it is just going to break someplace else. They've got the break sites covered like a glove, but the drainage capacity of the city is diminished. Here's what your readers need to know. You don't know what a 100-year storm is unless you have 1,000 years of records. When I was drilling that swamp out there, looking at the sediment disposition was just like going through tree rings. It was one hurricane after another, after another, after another. I couldn't even count them all. \n               How do you feel, now the work is done? \n             I'm really discouraged right now, because we did not get much response. As far as I can see, none of the elected officials seemed to care. We only had one show up to our press conference. We had the world's finest minds. We have a well-thought-out plan of attack for how to fix the problems that created this, but we don't have an audience for it. My wife would tell you that working on this has changed me. I am fighting against becoming overly pessimistic. I am really disappointed by my country.

The \u2018hobbit\u2018 debate continues. They may have been tiny, but the hobbits of the Indonesian island of Flores are still the focus of the biggest controversy in anthropology. The latest twist in the tale suggests that these one-metre-tall hominids, with a brain the size of a grapefruit, were the final members of a tool-making tradition stretching back more than 800,000 years. But amid fresh doubts over the species' evolutionary history, the idea that the curious creatures were deformed modern humans refuses to go away. News of the discovery of the 18,000-year-old remains of tiny people amazed the world when it was revealed in October 2004 (P. Brown  et al .  Nature   431 , 1055\u20131061; 2004; M. J. Morwood  et al .  Nature   431 , 1087\u20131091; 2004). Researchers named them  Homo floresiensis  after their home, and concluded that they were descendants of the much larger  Homo erectus  \u2014 the only hominid species known to have been in Asia at the right time. Since then, at least eight more individuals have been found (although the original specimen, called LB1, remains the only skull), dating from around 90,000 to just 12,000 years ago (M. J. Morwood  et al .  Nature   437 , 1012\u20131017; 2005). Some experts, such as Robert Martin of the Field Museum in Chicago, have never accepted that the fossils represent a new species of hominid, arguing that LB1's brain was just too small. He believes the hobbits were small modern humans and that LB1 had a deformed, miniature brain \u2014 a condition called microcephaly. In this hypothesis, tools found with the hobbits' remains must have been made by normal  Homo sapiens . A recent exchange (see  Science   312,  999; 2006) argued about whether casts of the inside of the hobbit skull resemble that of a microcephalic human \u2014 a debate that seems unlikely to be resolved soon (see \u2018Is the Flores hobbit a deformed  Homo sapiens ?\u2019). In  Nature  this week, a separate line of evidence points to  H. floresiensis  as a tool-maker. More than 500 stone blades found on Flores and dated to more than 700,000 years ago seem to have been made in the same way \u2014 by striking stones to chip off large flakes \u2014 as the more recent blades found with the hobbits. The earlier tools were almost certainly made by  H. erectus , say Adam Brumm of the Australian National University in Canberra and his colleagues (see  page 624 ). They conclude that  H. floresiensis  may have inherited the technique from  H. erectus , although they admit more evidence is needed, and are heading to Flores this month to try to acquire it. The  H. erectus  case is also supported by results from Susan Larson of Stony Brook University in New York. In April, she told the meeting of the Paleoanthropology Society in Puerto Rico that  H. floresiensis  has a shoulder joint more similar to  H. erectus  than  H. sapiens . However, even the researchers who unveiled the hobbit bones now think that Indonesia's  H. erectus  may have been too big to evolve into something so diminutive. Michael Morwood of the University of New England in Armidale, Australia, says he believes the hobbits may instead descend from a smaller, as-yet-undiscovered hominid, resembling 1.8 million-year-old specimens found at Dmanisi in Georgia. More fossils and artefacts are needed to settle the dispute. But views about  H. floresiensis  are now so entrenched that it will be difficult for some to retract their arguments, says Chris Stringer, an anthropologist at the Natural History Museum, London: \u201cWhoever digs in Flores now has to do so with an open mind.\u201d Is the Flores hobbit a deformed    Homo sapiens ? \n               YES \n             \n               Robert Martin, Field Museum, Chicago \n             The brain is too small to fit anything I know about. I calculated that if you start with a 60-kilogram  Homo erectus , you have to go down to 2 kilograms to get a brain that small \u2014 the size of a domestic cat. That started me thinking that LB1 must have been microcephalic. The average brain size for a human microcephalic brain is 400 cm 3 , the same as LB1. The brain of a 32-year-old microcephalic woman from Lesotho (skull pictured above) shows that, although roughly 75% of microcephalics die before adulthood, some get by surprisingly well. Although the other Flores individuals seem to have been small, they may have been a community with a microcephalic living among them, in which people with normal brains would have made the tools. \n               NO \n             \n               Dean Falk, Florida State University, Tallahassee \n             Microcephalics can and do have brains this size. But the LB1 brain doesn't have a microcephalic shape. We now also have parts of nine individuals, which shows LB1 is not a single pathological specimen. The Flores skull also has features that you just don't see in the brain of  Homo sapiens , particularly in the temporal lobes and the frontal lobe \u2014 an area involved in complex thinking. You need to look not just at size, but also organization, the internal wiring. This thing is small, but it's specialized. Martin's team don't provide enough detail to show the identifying features and landmarks of the brain. And as for the microcephalic human from Lesotho (pictured on left), compare that with LB1 (above). They do not look alike. \n               M.H. \n             \n                     More evidence for hobbit unearthed as diggers are refused access to cave \n                   \n                     Critics silenced by scans of hobbit skull \n                   \n                     The Flores find \n                   \n                     Little lady of Flores forces rethink of human evolution \n                   \n                     Flores man special \n                   \n                     UK Natural History Museum \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Munich Ten years ago, few would have imagined a European Union-wide fund for basic research, distributed without restrictions on scientific creed or country. The idea that the notoriously bureaucratic European Commission would finance such a fund, with no strings attached, would have stretched credibility too far. But two decisions last week moved the much-heralded European Research Council (ERC) closer to reality. The European Council of Ministers has approved a budget of \u20ac7.5 billion (US$9.7 billion) over seven years. And the fledgling ERC's scientific council has agreed on a first funding stream, open to any scientist embarking on an independent research career. Soon after that, a second stream of funding will be opened to investigators in all disciplines. Individual investigators may apply for grants of up to \u20ac1 million, and there is just one criterion for selection: excellence in cutting-edge research. \u201cERC grants will be like the National Institutes of Health's R01 investigator grants,\u201d says Fotis Kafatos, a biologist at Imperial College London and chairman of the ERC's scientific council. \u201cIndividuals can put in an application at any time.\u201d European scientists are famously frustrated by the complicated requirements of European Union (EU) Framework research programmes. These generally require multidisciplinary, multinational research groups working towards a defined industrial or social goal. Many have advocated an ERC for decades, arguing that it would raise the quality of research and provide a new source of funding for scientists in countries where national funds are paltry. The question was always: who would pay? National research agencies have legal and psychological difficulties with putting part of their funds into an international pot. And the European Commission has no mandate to fund basic research, its aim being to promote industrial competitiveness and improve quality of life in Europe. Mounting pressure from scientists eventually prompted a pragmatic solution, and the ERC is now part of the EU's next Framework Programme, FP7, which will run from 2007 to 2013. On 30 May, the council of ministers approved a budget of \u20ac50.5 billion for that programme and agreed on how it would be broken down, including the ERC's share. The plan must be ratified on 15 June by the European parliament, but is expected to pass with no major changes. \n               Foot on the ladder \n             The ERC's funding is less than had been hoped for when the concept began to gain momentum in 2002. \u201cBut it is not crumbs,\u201d says Kafatos. The annual budget will start at \u20ac300 million, rising to \u20ac1.5 billion in the seventh and last year. By then, Kafatos hopes, the ERC will have proved its value to politicians, and future Framework programmes would receive at least that much money. In the meantime, the ERC will open its Starting Grant scheme in its first year, aimed at scientists who are within ten years of completing their PhDs and seeking their first post as an independent investigator. \u201cThere are many countries where young scientists are kept dependent for far too long on their professors,\u201d says Kafatos. \u201cThis programme will allow them independence earlier.\u201d Julia Fischer, an animal-behaviour specialist at the German Primate Centre in G\u00f6ttingen, agrees. \u201cThere is a big difference between countries,\u201d she says. \u201cIn the United Kingdom it is easier to get on the career ladder than in Germany, for example.\u201d Fischer is on the board of the Young Academy, which comprises 50 top young scientists in German-speaking countries. One of the biggest concerns facing the ERC is the danger of oversubscription. There are well over a million full-time researchers in EU countries. \u201cWe have no idea how many scientists across the EU would in fact be eligible for the starting-investigators programme, or how many will apply,\u201d admits Helga Nowotny, a social scientist at the Vienna Centre for Urban Knowledge Management and vice-chair of the ERC's scientific council. But, she says, the planned two-stage selection process will ease the pain of any oversubscription. In the first stage, applicants must summarize their projects and give information about the research team that would carry them out. The winners in this round will be invited within six weeks to submit a full application. The council will establish at least 15 panels, organized by subject, to handle the final decisions. The panels will choose external referees to review the full proposals. This differs from the selection procedures of the Framework programmes, where the commission selects evaluators from a list of scientists who have volunteered for the job. \u201cThat is not a good system,\u201d says Nowotny. The scientific council is now consulting organizations such as national granting agencies and academies to identify panel members. \u201cOnly those with strong scientific reputations will be selected to join panels,\u201d says Kafatos. He doesn't think oversubscription will be a problem. \u201cScientists will exercise self-evaluation,\u201d he says. \u201cKnowing that only frontier research is going to be funded, only those who have really excellent proposals will apply.\u201d \n                     A firm foundation? \n                   \n                     Chairman explains Europe's research council \n                   \n                     Born to be in Brussels \n                   \n                     European Research Council \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Following the murder of two guards by illegal goldminers, scientists have been evacuated from a research station in the Nouragues nature reserve in French Guiana. The assassins were caught last week in R\u00e9gina, a village lying 40km from the station. The bodies of Domingo Ribamar da Silva and Andoe Saaki (\u2018Capi\u2019) were found on 18May at the Arata\u00ef ecotourism centre where they worked, a few kilometres from the Saut Parar\u00e9 and Inselberg research sites \u2014 all run by France's basic research agency, the CNRS. They had been shot, and the centre ransacked. Alain Pav\u00e9, the head of CNRS in French Guiana, ordered the temporary closure of the research station the day after the discovery of the bodies. Fourteen staff and their equipment were evacuated by helicopter to Cayenne, 100km away. The gendarmerie is protecting the few remaining staff, and the sites\u2019 facilities. The research station will not be reopened until security can be guaranteed, says Pav\u00e9. \u201cApparently this murder is deliberate, probably to chase the scientists and managers of the Nouragues reserve from the area,\u201d says Pierre Charles-Dominique, the tropical ecologist who heads the research station. The miners, or \u2018garimpeiros\u2019, most of whom come from neighbouring Brazil, have been a constant security concern for scientists, he adds. His station was ransacked by miners in 2004. The thieves made off with equipment worth \u20ac75,000 (US$100,000), and delayed a major research project (see  Nature   430 , 127; 200410.1038/430127a ). Illegal goldmining is a growing problem in the reserve, says Patrick Jansen, an ecologist at the University of Groningen in the Netherlands. The miners cause substantial ecological damage: they suction riverbeds for gold nuggets, fell trees, and pollute waterways with mud and mercury. Before the recent murders, scientists at the reserve were preparing to celebrate completion of the project delayed by the 2004 ransacking. The Canopy Operation Permanent Access System (COPAS) is designed to give scientists unprecedented access to the canopy of a tropical rainforest. It consists of a huge helium balloon and basket, which allows two scientists at a time to move vertically and horizontally within the canopy along a system of cables. Domingo and Capi had lunched with the COPAS research team at Saut Parar\u00e9 the Saturday before they were killed, researchers recall, as they put the final touches to the treetop system. All scientific work has now been put on hold. After the 2004 ransacking, the gendarmerie stepped up actions against the miners, introducing helicopter missions to find and destroy the mining sites, and arrest the miners, for example. But Charles-Dominique says that is not enough. \u201cWe cannot continue our research without a permanent military guard at the entrance of the reserve, and strong repressive action throughout the park,\u201d he says. And that's no easy task in the vast forest. Catherine Br\u00e9chignac, president of the CNRS, visited the centre on 25 May, as part of a scheduled visit to inaugurate COPAS. In response to the fears of some researchers that the station might be closed, she says \u201ccertainly not!\u201d. After discussions with local government, she promised that the centre will be protected by the gendarmes and the military until the CNRS finds a private firm of armed security guards to assist it. \u201cI made the decision last night: two murders is inadmissible, we can't let visiting scientists work under such conditions,\u201d she says. \u201cI don't know much it will cost, but the science here is very important. The CNRS is committed to it and we will pay whatever it takes.\u201d As  Nature  went to press, scientists were due to return to the station on 30 May, and COPAS will now be officially launched next week. Still, the incident has left researchers badly shaken. Ecologist Pierre-Michel Forget worked at the station from 1984 until 2003, when he decided that the situation was too dangerous and returned to his native France. \u201cNot everyone agreed with me in the scientific community,\u201d he says. \u201cBut today, unfortunately, I see that I was right to do so. We often stayed at the Arata\u00ef river camp when reaching the forest and the station by boat. This could have been me.\u201d \n                     Treetop ecologists brought down by miners \n                   \n                     Conservationists under fire in the Philippines \n                   \n                     Nouragues station \n                   \n                     COPAS (in French) \n                   \n                     Global Canopy Programme \n                   \n                     Canopy Crane Access Systems \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

A cluster of avian flu cases in Indonesia last month is being seen by many experts as a dry run for the handling of an emerging pandemic virus. But although the World Health Organization (WHO) says that all went well, some critics allege that the response to the virus \u2014 thought to have been moving between humans \u2014 shows how ill-prepared the international community and affected nations still are. \u201cAny chance of containment was absolutely hopeless,\u201d says Andrew Jeremijenko, who until March was head of influenza surveillance at the US Naval Medical Research Unit 2 in Jakarta. \u201cIf this was a test to see whether Indonesia could contain a virus, then they just failed miserably.\u201d The difficulties encountered also raise questions as to the practicality of a plan to try to stop an emerging pandemic in its tracks by rapid intervention. Modelling studies predict that if a pandemic virus emerges, the WHO would have at most three weeks to help the affected country to quarantine all carriers and treat those infected with antivirals (N. M. Ferguson  et al .  Nature   436 , 614\u2013615; 2005). The first case in the cluster fell ill on 24 April and died on 4 May. Samples were not taken, however, and alarm bells only rang when her relatives started going to hospitals in the days that followed. In total, eight members of an extended family in the village of Kubu Sembelang in north Sumatra became infected with H5N1. Six more of them have since died. Jeremijenko says the response was slow and disorganized. The first WHO official and a team of local officials didn't reach the village until 12 May. Other international experts did not reach the village until the following week, at least in one case because of difficulties getting an invitation from Indonesia's ministry of health, according to Jeremijenko. Villagers also refused to cooperate with the team initially. Several of the H5N1 patients fled hospitals, returning coughing to the community. \n               Spreading the news \n             The WHO made the outbreak public on 18May. Health officials \u2014 and stock markets \u2014 worldwide trembled five days later when the WHO budged from its previous standard line that \u201cthe most plausible source\u201d of the cluster was infected poultry, and acknowledged for the first time since the emergence of H5N1 that an extended chain of human transmission was the most likely explanation. Steven Bjorge, a WHO official in Jakarta, disputes the allegation of unnecessary delays and bungling, arguing that the WHO and the Indonesian government reacted promptly. \u201cThe team was in the field early, and the Indonesians are doing a good job,\u201d he says. The abscondments from hospital were \u201can unusual experience\u201d, he adds. Concerns over the cluster itself have eased as no new cases have since been reported nearby, and the WHO says the virus's sequence shows \u201cno evidence of significant mutations\u201d. The sequences have not been made public yet. The all-clear will not be given for another two weeks or so, however, and the pharmaceutical company Roche has been put on standby to send antiviral drugs to the region. Teams on the ground are trying to monitor fresh cases. But thousands of Indonesians die every day from tuberculosis, dengue and other infectious diseases, and almost all go untested for H5N1. On 29 May, the WHO announced six more cases in other areas of Indonesia, two of which were also a family cluster. \u201cThere have been a number of family clusters where only one person was tested,\u201d says Jeremijenko, adding that there is \u201conly limited testing, in large cities such as Surabaya, Medan, Bandung and Jakarta. We know we are missing cases, especially in rural areas.\u201d What caused the suspected human-to-human transmission at Kubu Sembelang is still a mystery.  Nature  has learned that the cases differed from past Indonesia cases, in that they had much higher viral loads in the throat and nose. Human-to-human transmission is more likely through droplets coughed from the nose and throat than from infections further down the respiratory tract. Mutations in cases in Turkey earlier this year showed a substitution of glutamic acid with lycine at position 627 in the PB2 component of the polymerase gene. The mutation is thought to allow the virus to survive in the cooler nasal regions. This mutation has not been publicly reported in Indonesia previously, but  Nature  has learned that it occurred in at least one case in August 2005. Another explanation is that the first case in last month's cluster had a particular genetic susceptibility to the virus, making her a \u2018superspreader\u2019. But it is too soon and the data are too sparse to know for sure, says Bjorge. Malik Peiris, a virologist at the University of Hong Kong who sequenced the virus, declined to comment on any mutations, saying that making sequences public is not his call. \u201cOur job as a WHO reference lab is to report back to the originating country and the WHO,\u201d he says. The WHO also declined to give any details. \u201cWe will leave that to the government of Indonesia, the owner of the data,\u201d says Bjorge. \n                     Despite doubts, containment plans for pandemic take shape \n                   \n                     Dreams of flu data \n                   \n                     Disease surveillance needs a revolution \n                   \n                     Alarms ring over bird flu mutations \n                   \n                     Indonesia struggles to control bird flu outbreak \n                   \n                     Avian Flu mashup (requires Google Earth) \n                   \n                     Avian flu web focus \n                   \n                     Bird Flu in focus \n                   \n                     Google Earth \n                   \n                     WHO avian flu site \n                   \n                     WHO updates on Indonesia \n                   \n                     Indonesian ministry of health \n                   \n                     Namru-2 \n                   \n                     Connotea web resources on avian flu \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Just as scientists and engineers from seven nations put the finishing touches to their design for a multi-billion-dollar experiment, an idea comes along that could improve it. The dilemma facing those working on the international fusion reactor, known as ITER, is whether or not to incorporate the change. ITER will cost roughly US$6 billion to build \u2014 and aims to be the first fusion reactor to produce more power than it consumes. It will work by using a web of carefully constructed magnetic fields to suspend a plasma gas, which is heated to hundreds of millions of degrees. A tweak to those fields is now being proposed, based on findings by plasma physicist Todd Evans and his team at General Atomics in San Diego, California. Evans's group successfully demonstrated a technique for preventing dangerous, lightning-like plasma discharges that could damage key parts of the reactor. These are caused when plasma builds up in the weakest areas of the magnetic field that contains it. \u201cThink of squeezing a balloon of water \u2014 the balloon bulges out through your fingers,\u201d says Evans. By modifying a reactor machine at General Atomics, called the DIII-D tokamak, the team made the rigid magnetic fields a little fuzzy \u2014 allowing excess plasma to gently leak away rather than bursting out. \u201cIn a sense, it's a beautiful concept,\u201d Evans says. The idea, which has been published in  Nature Physics  (T. E. Evans  et al .  Nature Phys.  doi:10.1038/nphys312; 2006), could help ITER to succeed more quickly. But it comes at a cost: the technique would probably require expensive superconducting coils to be placed near or inside the containment vessel, where space is limited and punishing radiation wears out equipment quickly. ITER researchers are now mulling over how to work such a breakthrough into the design, which originated more than 20 years ago and has already been through several iterations. The change will have to wind its way through several review committees before receiving final sign-off by designers in the countries funding it: the United States, the European Union, Japan, the Russian Federation, India, China and South Korea. It will also compete with other ideas in the field that could help prevent violent disruptions in the machine or extend the time it can hold fusing plasmas. Trying to get scientists and engineers to decide which changes to include in the final design and which to save for \u2018upgrades\u2019 isn't going to be easy, says Ned Sauthoff, a physicist at Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory in New Jersey and head of ITER's US team. \u201cITER is not just a physics experiment, it's also an experiment in large-scale project management.\u201d In the meantime supporters of the new concept will continue to conduct experiments, says Philippe Ghendrih, a theoretical physicist at the French Atomic Energy Commission in Cadarache, where further work is being done to integrate the idea into existing ITER designs. \u201cIf several other tokamaks can demonstrate the effect, then it will be easier to convince the engineers.\u201d A final design review will probably begin in the autumn, and should take about a year. \n                     Edge stability and transport control with resonant magnetic perturbations in collisionless tokamak plasmas \n                   \n                     Fusion power gets slammed \n                   \n                     Fusion energy: Just around the corner \n                   \n                     France wins fusion project \n                   \n                     General Atomics Fusion Group \n                   \n                     ITER \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Helsinki Forensic tools developed because of the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001 and the Indian Ocean tsunami of 26 December 2004 could soon find a happier use \u2014 helping reunite Jewish families separated by the Holocaust. The DNA Shoah project, announced on 1 June at the Human Genome Organisation's meeting in Helsinki, Finland, is the brainchild of Syd Mandelbaum, whose parents survived the Holocaust, or Shoah as it is known in Hebrew. Working with Michael Hammer, a geneticist at the University of Arizona in Tucson, Mandelbaum has launched a database of the DNA of survivors. The hope is to match sequences with Holocaustera remains that have surfaced in land-development projects in Poland, Germany and elsewhere in Europe. Another aim is to reunite some of the families of around 10,000 Holocaust orphans sent abroad from mainland Europe to Israel, the United States, Britain and elsewhere between 1945 and 1950. It is a difficult task. After more than 60 years in the ground, DNA will be degraded. And there are few reference sequences to compare it with: so many people were murdered that in many families all immediate relatives were killed. Matching distant relatives is statistically much harder. Findings from more recent disasters could help. At the World Trade Center in New York, where more than 2,700 died in the 9/11 attacks, fire degraded DNA to the point that standard DNA fingerprinting could not give a reliable match (L. G. Biesecker  et al .  Science   310,  1122\u20131123; 2005). Investigators turned to mitochondrial DNA, which is more plentiful and robust than the commonly used nuclear DNA. They also adopted a method called SNP typing, which works with smaller pieces of DNA. Yet, individually, none of these methods was precise enough to identify most remains. \u201cIt pushed the science to try more innovative techniques,\u201d says Richard Leary, managing director of the company Forensic Pathways, based in Staffordshire, UK. Gene Codes Forensics, a bioinformatics firm based in Ann Arbor, Michigan, developed software to integrate different kinds of DNA data and other forensic information. On the first day the system was used, 13 December 2001, it made more than 80 new matches, which helped identify 55 people who had been killed at the World Trade Center. So far, 1,598 victims have been identified by all means. Identifying those killed by the Asian tsunami posed different problems. The wave swept away houses containing personal items, such as hairbrushes, that could provide DNA samples, and also killed many family members at once, says Kirsty Wright, a forensics expert at the Queensland Health and Scientific Services in Brisbane, Australia, who helped identify victims. As well as multiple DNA profiling methods, the teams needed software that could match victims with distant relatives. Wright is now working on ways to match the DNAs of dead people with each other, so that multiple victims in one family can be identified simultaneously. The software from Gene Codes, which is among those that can match distant relatives, will handle the Shoah data. But time is running out. There are some 300,000 known Holocaust survivors, with an average age of 68. Mandelbaum and Hammer hope soon, with the help of the US Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington DC, to start collecting DNA from cheek swabs. For Howard Cash, president of Gene Codes, the idea that his firm's software could be used to bring good news is welcome. \u201cOur team has dealt with such terrible circumstances,\u201d he says. \u201cThey would be overjoyed to reunite someone with a family member they thought was lost.\u201d Leary says it highlights the potential of DNA forensics. \u201cThe issue for geneticists is to use this science in a very wide and imaginative way,\u201d he says. \n                     World Trade Centre forensics break new ground \n                   \n                     The DNA Shoah Project \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Scientists in the United States have won a reprieve from a proposed security regulation that would have restricted some foreign researchers' access to laboratories. On 31 May, the US Department of Commerce announced that it was withdrawing a proposed rule change that would have required scientists and students from \u201ccountries of concern\u201d \u2014 including Pakistan, India, Russia and China \u2014 to be licensed before using certain pieces of laboratory equipment. The decision, which surprised many, was hailed as a victory by science advocates in Washington DC. They say that the department responded responsibly to hundreds of complaints from researchers. The rule change was first suggested in 2004 by the department's independent inspector-general, as a modification to the existing \u2018deemed export regulations\u2019 on the export of sensitive technologies (see  Nature   431 , 615; 2004). The changes would have required some foreign researchers in the United States to obtain licences to use many pieces of equipment listed as \u2018controlled\u2019, because the devices could be used to strengthen a nation's military capabilities. An unclassified version of the list includes everything from chemical lasers to bacteria. Science advocates warned the proposal would create a mountain of paperwork and restrict access to laboratories. \u201cIt would have changed the whole open-campus research environment,\u201d says Robert Hardy of the Council on Government Relations, a Washington-based association for research universities. In a four-page notice in the  Federal Register , the official noticeboard of the US government, the department said that an existing exemption for foreign scientists would continue for now. The decision was made partly in response to complaints from universities, industry and even some government labs, according to David McCormick, undersecretary of commerce for industry and security. \u201cWe don't want to create regulations that make the research enterprise less productive,\u201d he says. McCormick says that the department is forming a 12-person committee, which he hopes will include experts in academia, industry and security, to examine the issue of laboratory security. The group, he says, will have a mandate to examine \u201cfundamental issues to do with deemed export policy\u201d. Tobin Smith, senior federal-relations officer at the Association of American Universities, says that he feels the group will be able to come to sensible conclusions about security issues. \u201cI'm pretty optimistic,\u201d he says. \n                     Academics stress licence threat to US science \n                   \n                     US rules on tech transfer to foreign nationals \n                   \n                     US universities up in arms over licence plans for foreign staff \n                   \n                     US Bureau of Industry and Security \n                   \n                     Association of American Universities \n                   \n                     Council on Governmental Relations \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

As evidence for global warming mounts, getting rid of nuclear power, with its very low carbon emissions, looks harder to justify in today's world than it did in the 1970s; hence the talk of a \u2018nuclear renaissance\u2019. But there is a difference between keeping today's nuclear-power capacity (about 365 GW of capacity, which is responsible for generating roughly 16% of the world's electricity) and greatly increasing it. With extensive nuclear expansion depending on reprocessing spent nuclear fuel, whether or not to reprocess is now shaping up to be a new dividing line in the nuclear debate. Reprocessing retrieves plutonium and unused uranium from used nuclear fuel. If you want to make sophisticated nuclear weapons, you need to have a reprocessing capacity, and the world's main nuclear-weapon powers all do. But not all of them have the capacity to reprocess spent fuel for civilian purposes. The United States has eschewed reprocessing as a way of making reactor fuel for the past 30 years. Now it is reconsidering it, sparking a reappraisal of the technology around the world. Reprocessing makes usable fuel out of unusable waste, and in doing so reduces the volume and activity of what's left behind. The proposed conversion to civil reprocessing in the United States is being spurred in part by a desire to limit the amount of waste that needs to be put into long-term storage at the contentious Yucca Mountain site in Nevada. Supporters point to the reduction of waste and the increase in the amount of energy that can be extracted from a fixed amount of fuel as \u2018green\u2019 credentials for the technology. They also point out that the world's uranium supplies may not be sufficient to support an aggressive expansion of nuclear power unless fuel is reused. But reprocessing is also accident-prone, expensive and makes available the sort of stuff that can be used to build bombs. No country has yet managed to make reprocessed fuel cheaper than the enriched uranium that is used in most reactors, undercutting any economic rationale at today's uranium prices. The reprocessing method the US Department of Energy proposes, called UREX+, aims to reduce the possibility of reprocessed plutonium being used in weapons by leaving it mixed with other highly radioactive metals. This supposedly leaves it too radioactive for malefactors to handle. But many opponents believe that the methods being discussed are still a security risk. The issues are a little too complex to get on to a bumper sticker. But the current state of play can be displayed on a map. The United States  is mulling over a proposal from the Bush administration to return to reprocessing, which the country has abjured due to proliferation concerns since India tested a bomb made from extracted plutonium in 1974. The new scheme, called the Global Nuclear Energy Partnership (GNEP), would have nuclear-weapons states plus Japan sending fuel to other states for use in their standard reactors. The donor countries would then take the fuel back for reprocessing. The idea has been received frostily in some quarters. The House of Representatives allocated about half of the funds requested by the administration to the project, saying there was too little detail in the plan to warrant a $250-million investment. Many scientists and activists \u2014 both pro and anti nuclear power \u2014 have criticized the economics, timing and safety of the plan. The United Kingdom  is home to the Sellafield site, where a reprocessing plant called Thorp has been inoperative since the discovery in April 2005 of a broken pipe that was leaking uranium and plutonium in a sealed-off cell. The incident renewed talk of shutting down the plant, which has been charged with polluting the Irish and North Seas. The publicly owned contractor that runs the whole Sellafield site, including two reprocessing plants and a hodgepodge of retired infrastructure needing clean-up, is up for sale. France  is the king of reprocessing (the United Kingdom's Thorp plant never ran at capacity). Nuclear company Areva has plants at La Hague that have reprocessed waste from France's own extensive nuclear-power industry, as well as from Belgium, Switzerland, the Netherlands and Japan. In 2004 and 2005, weapons-grade plutonium that the United States promised Russia it would get rid of was reprocessed at Areva's Cadarache fuel plant into mixed-oxide (MOX) fuel. The MOX fuel was then used at the Catawba Nuclear Station in South Carolina. Sweden  is now thinking of reprocessing the waste from its nuclear-power industry for the first time in 20 years. A shipment of waste will set sail for Sellafield in the summer of 2007, if all goes as planned. India  reprocesses at three small plants. Famously, it got the technology from the United States, then used the plutonium it extracted to make a nuclear bomb, which it tested in 1974. India was affronted when asked to join the GNEP not as a provider of reprocessing power but as a client. Australia's  prime minister, John Howard, announced on 6 June that the nuclear-free country will study the possibility of building some nuclear power plants, and of becoming a reprocessing nation. Howard visited US energy secretary Sam Bodman last month to discuss the GNEP reprocessing scheme. Russia  reprocesses its waste to form uranium, which it uses again as fuel, and plutonium, which it stores. Plans to build fast reactors that could burn pure plutonium have been edging forwards for years. Russia would like to import waste from other countries to stake a claim in a future \u2018plutonium economy\u2019, in part because it has little domestic uranium. According to Russian news reports, the head of the Mayak reprocessing plant, Vitaliy Sadovnikov, was charged with polluting the river Techa in March, but given amnesty in May because it was the 100th anniversary of the national state legislature. Japan  has just begun a 17-month test phase at the brand-new Rokkasho reprocessing plant, which is far larger than the Tokai pilot reprocessing plant, now headed for retirement. The new plant's capacity will be 800 tonnes per year. Japan has also agreed, on paper, to join the GNEP, but a 1988 agreement banning the transfer of reprocessing technology between Japan and the United States is standing in the way.

In a demonstration of how international negotiations should be done, 12 national science academies have issued two joint statements to the leaders of the G8 countries, who will meet at their annual summit in Russia next month. One endorses a reinvention of the world's disease surveillance system; the other calls for a major expansion of energy research to address a looming global crisis in energy supplies. The statements were announced on 14 June by the academies of the G8 countries plus Brazil, China, India and South Africa. They follow the first such exercise at last year's Gleneagles summit in Britain, when Britain's Royal Society coordinated joint academy statements on climate change as well as capacity building for Africa. The academies\u2019 stronger role in international advocacy is a \u201cnew and extremely positive development\u201d, says Martin Rees, president of the Royal Society. \u201cIt's a step towards the international scientific community having a more effective voice at the political level.\u201d Rees believes the academies' input influenced the outcome of last year's G8, which included greater debt relief for Africa. And he hopes the string of recommendations for disease surveillance and the energy crisis from the 12 academies (see  'What the academies want' ) will translate in firm pledges from this year's G8 meeting. The academies argue that the size of global efforts in both infectious diseases and energy sourcing are out of touch with the scale of the problems. They lament the inadequacy of the current systems of national and international disease surveillance, which they describe as \u201cmulti-component and uncoordinated\u201d. The threat of avian flu, they argue, should be a catalyst for investment in a more tightly coordinated global system, that in particular would see animal and human health experts working more closely together. Likewise, Rees says the G8 must address what he describes as serious inadequacies in funding and incentives for energy research: \u201cIn relation to the scale of the problem, the R&D effort worldwide is unduly low.\u201d Although the G8 and other international political meetings are important for setting agendas and funding priorities, the academies recognize their shortcomings, says Andr\u00e9 Capron, foreign secretary of France's Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences. In particular, he criticizes the \u201cdisappointing\u201d habit of states in neglecting to honour pledges once they get home. At an avian-flu summit in Beijing in January, for example, countries pledged US$1.9 billion in grants and loans to a global action plan, but so far only $1 billion has been committed, and of that just $286 million has been spent. Donors also often insist that funds go to particular countries or projects, making it hard to organize a global plan that targets areas in greatest need. But Capron says scientists can only be \u201cdeliberately optimistic\u201d about such realities, and hope to influence decisions \u201cthrough constantly repeating the same messages, and making the scientific communities' positions known\u201d. Rees agrees: \u201cFor 12 academies of leading countries to emphasize the importance of these issues is an important signal to governments that they need to be addressed.\u201d \n               Consensus building \n             So how does one go about getting scientists from 12 countries to agree on hot topics such as avian flu and energy? Capron says two to three members of each academy met a few months ago in Moscow to thrash out ideas and produce draft statements. They took these home for discussion, then after much e-mailing about wording, joint texts were agreed. There was a \u201cspontaneous consensus\u201d on the major steps needed for infectious diseases, according to Capron, with a \u201cmore protracted\u201d discussion on energy. All Capron is prepared to say about initial disagreements on energy is that the United States differed with Europe (France in particular) on the degree of support for research into nuclear energy, compared with other technologies such as carbon sequestration. France is highly dependent on nuclear energy, and lacks the coal reserves of the United States. But these were \u201cdivergences\u201d rather than \u201caggressive differences\u201d, he says diplomatically. This kind of collaboration among the academies will improve with time, he adds, in particular by better involving academy members in the process. Lack of consultation marred the first joint statements on climate change last year, when the Royal Society issued a press release with its own interpretation of the consensus statement, leading to cries of foul play and spin by its partners. Such teething troubles won't occur this year, assures Capron. He has now written rules on the procedures, which include requiring any press releases to be jointly agreed by all. \n                     Dreams of flu data \n                   \n                     Disease surveillance needs a revolution \n                   \n                     Grim but determined \u2014 the G8 reaches accord on Africa and climate \n                   \n                     Science & Africa: A message to the G8 summit \n                   \n                     Sustainable outcomes from Gleneagles \n                   \n                     G8 Gleneagles 2005 \n                   \n                     G8 St Petersburg, 2006-06-13 \n                   \n                     UK Royal Society \n                   \n                     Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences \n                   \n                     The Interacademy Panel on International Issues \n                   \n                     InterAcademy Council (IAC) \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Berkeley, California Researchers in the field of synthetic biology are to issue a declaration of intent about professional behaviour and organization in order to ensure good practice and to address a range of concerns about their research. The scientists hope to ensure that controversy doesn't choke the field just as it begins to make progress. But critics are likely to be unimpressed \u2014 a coalition of organizations concerned about the technology released an open letter ahead of the meeting calling for the field to be externally regulated. The scientists and engineers meeting this week in Berkeley for the Synthetic Biology 2.0 conference discussed recent advances towards their goal of being able to develop biological systems from scratch. But they also devoted a day of the meeting to issues of intellectual property, biosecurity, risks and standards. As  Nature  went to press, participants were drafting a set of statements to be posted online ( http://pbd.lbl.gov/sbconf ) for others to comment on. They intend to present this as an outcome of the meeting. One suggestion discussed at the conference was a possible commitment to buy synthesized DNA only from companies that screen orders for safety and security concerns, for instance by checking them against a list of dangerous pathogens. The community hopes this would force companies that do not already use such methods to adopt them, making it harder for those with malicious intentions to obtain deadly DNA. The synthetic biologists hope that, by regulating themselves, they can stave off attempts to set controls or limits on the field. The science is moving rapidly: at the meeting, for example, Chris Voigt from the University of California, San Francisco, reported that his lab has engineered  Salmonella  bacteria to make and secrete protein components \u2014 a difficult task made easier by the lab's deliberate simplification of the genetic code for the proteins. And Jeff Boeke from the Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland, has built, from scratch, a retrotransposon \u2014 a genetic element capable of jumping around the genome. Boeke's retrotransposon is designed to be a far more effective \u2018jumper\u2019 than natural retrotransposons, and indeed, inserts itself into many more places in the genome. \n               Laboratory life \n             Such early success has synthetic biologists dreaming of far grander projects. Boeke, for instance, is gathering support for the idea of engineering synthetic yeast organisms, making them compete against each other, and watching which strains evolve. George Church's lab at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Boston, is making synthetic stretches of  Escherichia coli  DNA with the goal of \u2018optimizing\u2019 the bacterium's genome and reconstituting it from scratch. Drew Endy at MIT has already done this with a T7 bacteriophage. And while other scientists have built whole viruses from synthetic DNA by simply ordering viral DNA from a gene-synthesis company (see  Nature   418 , 265; 200210.1038/418265a ), synthetic biologists envisage something different. Their goal is to strip genomes down to their essential parts to try to learn more about the principles behind the architecture of life. \u201cThe time is right for this,\u201d Boeke says. \u201cThis would allow us to answer functional questions we can't ask in any other way.\u201d But as exciting as these ideas are, they also raise concerns about the proper use of such technology. A coalition of organizations traditionally concerned about biotechnology, including the ETC Group, Greenpeace and GeneWatch UK, submitted an open letter to the synthetic biologists and to media before the meeting, protesting against the biologists' self-regulating approach. \u201cWe believe that this potentially powerful technology is being developed without proper societal debate concerning socioeconomic, security, health, environmental and human rights implications,\u201d the letter states. \n               Enemy agents? \n             Companies have already run up against biosecurity issues. Jeremy Minshull, president and co-founder of the company DNA 2.0, and Hans B\u00fcgl of Geneart, based in Regensburg, Germany, have both turned away orders for potentially hazardous DNA. In Geneart's case, an Indian customer ordered a stretch of DNA that is banned for export by the German government. In Minshull's case, a client ordered a pathogen on the \u2018select agent\u2019 list of organisms issued by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). No one at the agency could tell Minshull how to handle this sensitive order, so he cancelled it. In both cases, the companies believed the customers had good intentions. The DNA 2.0 case is particularly worrying, says Gerald Epstein of the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington DC: \u201cCDC implements a select agent list, but it doesn't say anything about what happens if somebody suspects somebody else of doing something bad.\u201d Ultimately, the synthetic biologists said at the meeting, the best way to deal with these issues is to pursue projects that benefit society. For instance, Jonathan Eisen of the University of California, Davis, said the community can make a positive contribution to biodefence by engineering ways to tag and track DNA.

{"file_id": "441392a", "url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/441392a", "year": 2006, "authors": [{"name": "David Cyranoski"}], "parsed_as_year": "2006_or_before", "body": "As accusations of scientific misconduct in China become rife, some fear persecution reminiscent of that used in the Cultural Revolution. Chinese science risks being sliced up by a double-edged sword: rampant scientific misconduct on the one hand, and persecution based on false accusations on the other. The lack of confidence in official mechanisms for properly investigating fraud has led to increased reliance on websites that challenge the records and publications of Chinese scientists. But many are concerned about the damage such untested allegations can cause; more than 100 Chinese scientists based in the United States have sent an open letter to the Chinese government, asking it to set up mechanisms to ensure that claims of scientific misconduct are investigated fairly. China admits it faces a serious problem with scientific misconduct, including plagiarism, and the fabrication and falsification of data. The scale of the problem is unknown, but a recent spate of allegations has drawn attention to the issue. In March, Hui Liu, the assistant dean of Tsinghua University medical school in Beijing, was fired, following claims that he had boosted his publication list with papers by another H. Liu (see  Nature   440 , 728; 2006). Liu has reportedly denied the charges and blamed the mix-up on a clerical error. In April, Sichuan University in Chengdu was criticized by the Chinese media for finding one of its professors innocent of fabricating a paper; the paper has been under attack since its publication in 2000. And two weeks ago, Jin Chen of Shanghai's Jiaotong University, whose announcements of one of China's first digital signal-processing chips in 2003 stoked patriotic fervour, was condemned by his university for faking research and stealing designs from a foreign company. In all three cases, a popular Chinese-language website known as New Threads ( http://www.xys.org ), which has a reputation for disclosing scientific fraud in China, played a key role in fuelling public outcry. In the first two cases, postings of the accusations on New Threads led to the Chinese media picking up on the stories. And the website's owner, Shi-min Fang, a biochemist based in San Diego, California, claims he was the first to post the name of the company that supposedly polished and re-labelled another brand's chips for Chen. The power of the website to implicate scientists in the absence of adequate formal mechanisms of investigation has put it at the centre of concerns over claims of misconduct. Xin-Yuan Fu, an immunologist at Indiana University in Indianapolis, says it was the Sichuan University case that drove him to write a letter to key science-policy officials, including China's science and technology minister and the head of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, asking them to take action. The letter struck a chord among his peers \u2014 within five days of circulating it to other Chinese biologists based in the United States, Fu's letter had collected 120 signatures, including those of two researchers in China. \u201cI was overwhelmed,\u201d says Fu. After noting the need to expose all types of misconduct, the letter focuses on the problem of unfounded allegations, particularly those that attack scientific claims without giving evidence of faulty laboratory procedures. It ends by condemning the tendency to make \u201cpersonal attacks anonymously in public... in the absence of proper investigation\u201d. Fu says the Sichuan University incident is a case in point. Yuquan Wei, vice-president of the university, published a paper in  Nature Medicine  in 2000 detailing the use of foreign endothelial cells as a vaccine to prevent tumour growth. The paper claimed success in mice and suggested the technique could work in humans ( Nature Med.   6,  1160\u20131166; 2000). But Lusheng Si, an immunopathologist at Xi'an Jiaotong University who first came across the paper when reviewing a grant proposal by Wei in 2001, suspected that it contained fabricated data. On 26 March this year, after hearing that Wei was using the paper to request a further large grant, Si attacked the paper on New Threads. The letter led to a media fury in China and an investigation by Wei's university. Sichuan concluded that Wei had committed no offence, and that the dispute over Wei's research was simply a run-of-the-mill academic disagreement. The media in China has continued to criticize Wei and Sichuan University, but many scientists think Si's attack was irresponsible and based on unsound interpretation of scientific concepts and procedures. Si contends, for example, that the mouse immune system should respond to all proteins in foreign cells, whereas Wei's paper suggests that immunized mice selectively respond to a few antigens. \u201cThis violates a fundamental law of immunology,\u201d Si says. But Lieping Chen, an immunologist at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in Baltimore, Maryland, and a signatory to Fu's letter, disagrees with Si. Chen says that a selective immune response to one or a few foreign proteins is an aspect of well-known phenom\u2013enon known as immunodominance. Si also questions the number of mice Wei used, estimating this to be around 40,000. \u201cThis is too big to believe,\u201d he says. Wei, backed by Chen, says Si has miscalculated the number, and that less than 5,000 mice were actually used. But even those who defend Wei admit that his response hasn't helped. For example, Si claims that Wei has so far refused to release his raw data, which most agree would settle the issue. Wei told  Nature , \u201cI did not say I cannot release raw data for inspection\u201d, but he has not clarified whether he will make his data available. He has denied all misconduct. The university's investigation into the matter has failed to convince many that the truth won out, mainly because it lacked transparency. \u201cThe recent self-investigation into alleged fraud at Sichuan University is a total joke,\u201d says Mu-ming Poo, a neurobiologist at the University of California, Berkeley, and head of the Institute of Neurosciences in Shanghai.  Nature 's request for details on the university procedure and an introduction to members of the investigation committee was referred to Wei; as  Nature  went to press he had not provided any information about the investigation. Poo believes the incident is indicative of the fact that most Chinese universities lack the capacity to investigate one of their own. \u201cThe outcome is likely to be influenced by the university's own interests, such as protecting its reputation,\u201d he says. Fu's letter, sent on 8 May, calls for greater involvement of higher-level funding bodies such as the science ministry, the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) and the Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC). These institutions already have investigatory bodies. The CAS established its ethics committee in 1997 and drafted guidelines in 2001. The NSFC committee, established in 1998, says it investigated 445 allegations of misconduct in its first five years (out of an estimated 30,000 projects that it funded during that time). In the most severe cases, the committee indefinitely blocks perpetrators from applying for funds. But many scientists feel these committees are ineffective, and a lack of confidence in their ability to settle matters is driving those with grievances to publish them on the Internet. For example, Si says he considered sending his complaint to the CAS or to the science ministry, but he was unable to find contact details for either. So he posted his accusation on New Threads instead.  Nature 's attempts to contact the committees of the CAS and the NSFC were also unsuccessful. \u201cIt is the [effective] absence of such formal mechanisms that makes New Threads important,\u201d says Fu. But Fu, a human-rights advocate, is worried that the media frenzy following irresponsible web-based accusations, particularly by those who don't identify themselves, hearkens back to China's \u2018big letter\u2019 posters or \u2018dazibao\u2019. These wall-mounted handwritten posters were used to persecute those considered enemies of the government during the Cultural Revolution in the 1970s. \u201cAnyone could write anything, and people would read it and assume it was right,\u201d says Chen. \u201cIt would be a terrible thing to go through again, in academia.\u201d Fang, who has been widely praised since setting up his website in 2001 for exposing bad science and trying to raise the profile of research ethics in China, defends his postings. He says he only accepts about 10% of submitted letters, and that he only publishes allegations from correspondents who identify themselves to him. He adds that he does some preliminary investigation and sometimes asks outside experts for their opinions. But several scientists have written to  Nature  to express concern over how powerful Fang's website has become, saying they are afraid to be named for fear of becoming his enemy. Ideally, Fu says he would like to see China establish a new agency staffed by experts trained in scientific misconduct that could investigate claims of fraud, akin to the US Office of Research Integrity. That would certainly be necessary to resolve the case of Si versus Wei, says  Nature Medicine 's editor-in-chief Juan-Carlos Lopez. \u201cThere's been enough of this \u2018he said, she said\u2019 nonsense,\u201d says Lopez. \u201cIt's time for the competent authorities to get involved.\u201d How likely that is to happen is unclear. Fu and his co-signatories have yet to receive any response from the Chinese authorities. \n                     News in brief \n                   \n                     Japan's research conduct \n                   \n                     Immunotherapy of tumors with xenogeneic endothelial cells as a vaccine \n                   \n                     Hwang special \n                   \n                     New Threads \n                   \n                     Xin-Yuan Fu \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Tokyo Tadashi Suzuki was a fossil-mad high-school student when he discovered some ancient bones in a riverbank near his home. He wrote to a local palaeontologist about them, thinking he might have discovered a plesiosaur. That was in 1968. Almost four decades later, his find has finally been confirmed as a new species. Although the time taken in this case is extreme, experts say it highlights the problems many palaeontologists face in raising the funds to characterize and classify new discoveries. Suzuki, now 54, says he has been fascinated by fossils since his childhood. When he was 17, he read about a fossil plesiosaur \u2014 a long-necked reptile that flourished in the world's oceans during the Cretaceous era \u2014 being found in his home town of Iwaki City, about 200 kilometres north of Tokyo. \u201cI thought I could find another,\u201d he says. He went down to the same riverbank and discovered more bones. Rather than disturb the fossils, he wrote to Ikuo Obata, a palaeontologist in Tokyo, to tell him about the find. Obata's colleague Yoshikazu Kasegawa took on the project. It took about seven years to excavate the fossil bones, clean them up and assemble them into a three-metre-long plesiosaur skeleton, which is around 70% complete. Hasegawa believed Suzuki's find to be a new species, but research then slowed almost to a halt. Proving that a specimen is a new species requires comparing it to all other known specimens and showing it is sufficiently different. Hasegawa, now head of the Gunma Museum of Natural History, says he couldn't afford all the relevant references as well as travel to foreign museums and libraries. The project finally took off in 2003, when Tamaki Sato joined the team. A researcher at the National Science Museum in Tokyo, she had studied plesiosaurs in Canada and had data from other specimens. The paper describing Suzuki's plesiosaur as a new species was finally published this month (T. Sato, Y. Hasegawa and M. Manabe  Palaeontology   49,  467\u2013484; 2006). \u201cI am delighted to see the research published,\u201d says Suzuki, now chief researcher at his local ammonite centre. \u201cI think the 38 years were inevitable.\u201d The team has called it  Futabasaurus suzukii  and reports that it is an elasmosaur, the main type of plesiosaur. Elasmosaurs lived all over the world, but few specimens from Asia have been well preserved. The Japanese find is 85 million years old, the oldest specimen in the northern Pacific confirmed to be an elasmosaur. Plesiosaurs have been little studied compared with other species groups that were around at the time, such as dinosaurs and invertebrates. Many details, such as how they swam, remain a mystery (see  \u2018Mystery and myth behind the plesiosaur\u2019 ). \u201cIt's a nice addition to the story of plesiosaurs,\u201d says Leslie No\u00e9, a specialist in ancient reptiles at the University of Cambridge's Sedgwick Museum in Britain. \u201cNew plesiosaurs give us a unique insight into the biodiversity of the Cretaceous seas.\u201d No\u00e9 says it would take about five years to get a fossil find classified if researchers had sufficient time, money and personnel. But the situation faced by Hasegawa and his colleagues will sound familiar to many palaeontologists, who find it increasingly difficult to get funds, he adds. \u201cLarge fossil vertebrates are seen as high profile by the public, but this rarely results in the money required to study and display the specimens becoming available.\u201d \n                     Heads up: the dinosaur with the longest neck \n                   \n                     Palaeontology: Hooked on fossils \n                   \n                     Glaciers are flowing faster \n                   \n                     Dinosaurs in focus \n                   \n                     The National Science Museum \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Two of the specimens showed promise, and on 12 May P\u00e4\u00e4bo's team reported at the Biology of Genomes meeting at New York's Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory that they had managed to sequence around a million base pairs of nuclear DNA \u2014 around 0.03% of the genome \u2014 from one of them. This is a 45,000-year-old male specimen found in Vindija Cave outside Zagreb, Croatia. Typically, DNA to be sequenced must be cloned in bacteria to produce large enough amounts for study. But because the Neanderthal DNA had broken down into tiny fragments, P\u00e4\u00e4bo and his colleagues used a new sequencing technique, developed by 454 Life Sciences in Branford, Connecticut, that allows genetic fragments in an emulsion to be sequenced directly in tiny wells. They are now analysing the results to work out how the different fragments fit together so that they can be compared with the modern human genome sequence. One finding so far is that the Neanderthal Y chromosome is substantially more different from human and chimp Y chromosomes than are other chromosomes. This suggests that little interbreeding occurred, at least among the more recent Neanderthal species. Edward Rubin, director of the Joint Genome Institute in Walnut Creek, California, works with P\u00e4\u00e4bo. The two are also working to sequence Neanderthal DNA by the traditional method. James Noonan, a postdoc in Rubin's lab, reported at the Cold Spring Harbor meeting that preliminary analysis of the 75,000 base pairs sequenced so far shows that Neanderthals diverged from the lineage that led to modern humans about 315,000 years ago \u2014 around the time that had been thought.  Homo sapiens  is known to have evolved at least 200,000 years ago (I. McDougall, F. H. Brown and J. G. Fleagle  Nature   433 , 733\u2013736; 2005). Back in 1997, P\u00e4\u00e4bo reported sequencing the first mitochondrial DNA from a Neanderthal (M. Krings  et al .  Cell   90,  19\u201330; 1997). That sequence also suggested that Neanderthals split from the common lineage well before modern humans evolved and may not have contributed any mitochondrial DNA, at least to modern humans. But the more extensive nuclear DNA sequences should pin down the timing of the split more precisely, and comparing genes for particular traits could help researchers work out which characteristics were shared by Neanderthals, and when such traits arose. Such comparisons could also confirm whether Neanderthals did contribute isolated genes to the human lineage. For example, John Hardy, a geneticist at the National Human Genome Research Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, has hypothesized that Neanderthals may have contributed a gene that is linked to several neurodegenerative diseases, because it is found in people of European ancestry, where the Neanderthals lived. Proving that theory would require finding this version of the gene in the Neanderthal genome. Researchers are confident about the prospects for sequencing much more Neanderthal DNA. \u201cOur goal is to sequence a large amount of the Neanderthal genome,\u201d says P\u00e4\u00e4bo. That task will probably require identifying new fossils. \u201cWe should do it,\u201d agreed Francis Collins, director of the National Human Genome Research Institute, after attending P\u00e4\u00e4bo's lecture on 12 May. Rubin says he envisages creating a bank of Neanderthal DNA, so that representative samples can be compared with the thousands of  H. sapiens  genomes that are expected to be sequenced in the future. \u201cIn ten years, we hope to have ten Neanderthal genomes,\u201d says Rubin. \n                     Genome sequencing in microfabricated high-density picolitre reactors \n                   \n                     Stratigraphic placement and age of modern humans from Kibish, Ethiopia \n                   \n                     A common inversion under selection in Europeans \n                   \n                     Archaeology: Those elusive Neanderthals \n                   \n                     Neanderthal DNA confirms distinct history \n                   \n                     Cell article on Neanderthal DNA \n                   \n                     Svante P\u00e4\u00e4bo, Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology \n                   \n                     Edward Rubin, DOE joint Genome Institute \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

It was Garret FitzGerald, the chair of pharmacology at the University of Pennsylvania, who first proposed that the painkiller Vioxx and its cousins might cause heart attacks by tipping a crucial hormonal balance. So neither of two attention-grabbing data sets published this month has come as a great surprise to him, despite the implications the data are likely to have for the 11,500 lawsuits from former patients that dog the drug's manufacturer, Merck. One study, published in the  Canadian Medical Association Journal 1 , shows that Vioxx, now withdrawn, caused heart attacks within days of users first taking it. The other data, released last week by Merck, suggest that subjects remained at increased risk of heart attack and stroke for a year after they stopped taking the drug 2 . \u201cThese data are extremely interesting if you're a lawyer, but scientifically and mechanistically they show exactly what you'd expect,\u201d says FitzGerald. Others disagree. Nobody expected the Merck results, says Steven Nissen, a cardiologist at the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio. \u201cWe all thought that if you stopped the drug, the risk would go away. These data suggest there may be more longstanding injury to blood vessels.\u201d The difference of opinion reflects uncertainty over exactly how heart attacks and strokes are caused by Vioxx (rofecoxib) and related drugs, which all work by inhibiting an enzyme known as cyclooxygenase-2. It is widely accepted that these \u2018COX2 inhibitors\u2019 exert their effects in part by suppressing prostacyclin \u2014 a product of the COX2 enzyme. Prostacyclin plays a key role in mediating pain and inflammation: the drugs were developed to combat inflammatory diseases such as arthritis. \n               Off balance \n             But studies in mice have shown that prostacyclin also acts as a general restraint on platelet activation, and on factors that accelerate hardening of the arteries (atherosclerosis), boost blood pressure and activate blood clotting. Key among these factors is a molecule called thromboxane. Crudely put, prostacyclin and thromboxane normally balance each other's opposing effects. Introducing a COX2 inhibitor can tip the balance dangerously toward thromboxane, raising blood pressure, possibly hardening arteries and certainly promoting heart-attack and stroke-causing clots in some people. The Canadian study, which found that Vioxx's adverse effects kicked in almost immediately, fits neatly with this theory. There is an established link between prostacyclin suppression and excessive clotting, points out Eric Topol, a geneticist at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland. \u201cIf you start to suppress prostacyclin, you could see a clot form relatively quickly. Why would you need months or a year to see that?\u201d The Merck data are more difficult to explain. FitzGerald says they fit with his work in mice, which shows that COX2 inhibitors can cause atherosclerosis \u2014 not an injury that would recede rapidly once the offending drug is stopped. But this has not been demonstrated in humans. \u201cI don't think it's well-established\u201d that Vioxx causes atherosclerosis in people, says Nissen. \u201cBut Garret's been right about a lot. He may be right about this.\u201d Frank Ruschitzka, a cardiologist at the University Hospital in Zurich, who has studied Pfizer's Celebrex, another COX2 inhibitor, says it is a mistake to draw any mechanistic conclusions from Merck's report. The study it is drawn from, he notes, was not designed to examine heart attacks 3 . \u201cWe don't know the mechanisms,\u201d he says. \u201cSo everyone involved should just lower their voices.\u201d Ruschitzka has designed a trial of 20,000 subjects to be launched later this year, with Nissen as principal investigator. It will compare the incidence of heart attacks, strokes and cardiovascular deaths in subjects taking Celebrex (celecoxib) with those using the traditional anti-inflammatories ibuprofen and naproxen. Only such a huge, randomized, head-to-head controlled trial \u2014 paid for by Pfizer at a cost of hundreds of millions of US dollars \u2014 will allow the science of the side effects to be truly sorted out, he says. Ruschitzka believes that more mechanisms are at work than the balance-tipping theory admits. For instance, in one recent paper, he showed that Celebrex reduces expression of a protein that initiates coagulation 4 . Vioxx doesn't have this effect. \u201cIf FitzGerald tells us it's just one mechanism, he's wrong,\u201d says Ruschitzka. Others, including Topol, believe that a minority of individuals may have a genetically determined sensitivity to Vioxx. But this could be pinned down only by a genome-wide study comparing those who develop clotting with those who do not. And that's not a study that Pfizer or Merck are rushing to sponsor. The quest to clear these murky waters isn't just academic, even if Vioxx itself is unlikely ever to be resurrected. It is hoped that other COX2 inhibitors may eventually treat diseases as diverse as colon cancer and Alzheimer's. And it is therefore vital to flesh out the mechanism of their cardiac dangers, so the risk\u2013benefit equation is understood before the drugs saturate new markets. As for former Vioxx patients, Nissen says they should all be closely monitored for at least a year. He tells his own patients that their risk of heart attack has been almost doubled, and that \u201cthey should do everything they can to control their risk factors\u201d. \n                     Make or break time in Vioxx drama \n                   \n                     Painkiller in the dock \n                   \n                     Painkiller verdict shows mistrust of Merck \n                   \n                     Canadian Medical Association Journal study \n                   \n                     Merck press release on new APPROVe data \n                   \n                     Merck summary report on APPROVe study \n                   \n                     NEJM APPROVe study \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

A promising new antibiotic is generating both excitement and despondency. It is the first new chemical class of antibiotic to be found in more than two decades, but experts fear that the hurdles to turning the compound into an effective commercial drug could mean that it ends up collecting dust on a shelf. The drug, called platensimycin and reported on  page 358 , kills several of the major drug-resistant bacteria that plague hospitals. Among them are methicillin-resistant  Staphyloccocus aureus  (MRSA) and bacteria resistant to vancomycin, one of the last lines of antibiotic defence. Only two other new chemical classes of antibiotic have been discovered and approved for use since the early 1960s: daptomycin and linezolid. Most antibiotics used today were discovered in the 1940s and 1950s, and newer versions have mainly been made by chemically nipping and tucking these compounds. They generally kill bacteria by blocking the production of proteins, DNA or the bacterial cell wall. Platensimycin has a novel chemical structure and works differently from other commercially available antibiotics by crippling FabF, a bacterial enzyme involved in manufacturing fatty acids. It thus stops bacteria from making the fatty cell membranes they need to grow. Two commercially available antibiotics, triclosan and isoniazid, target another enzyme involved in fatty-acid synthesis, but these do not kill the same array of bacteria. The researchers at Merck Research Laboratories in Rahway, New Jersey, who discovered platensimycin, did so by reviving and tuning an established strategy. They searched for naturally existing compounds that microbes typically make to kill neighbouring bacteria. This technique originally yielded many potent antibiotics, but was abandoned by many drug companies as the rate of return diminished and has been replaced by chemical methods to generate novel synthetic molecules. Traditionally, researchers have tested whether a tiny amount of chemical can kill off a circle of bacteria growing on a plate. But by first making the bacteria more vulnerable, the Merck researchers searched for natural products that might have been missed in such conventional assays. They engineered  S. aureus  bacteria to make less of the FabF enzyme than normal, using a snippet of RNA to block the production of this protein (K. Young  et al .  Antimicrob. Agents Chemother.   50,  519\u2013526; 2006). The researchers then tested whether any of 250,000 natural-product extracts could block the growth of the disabled strain \u2014 and pulled out platensimycin, a small molecule made by a strain of  Streptomyces platensis  bacteria in a South African soil sample. \u201cIt allowed us to find a needle in a haystack, and something we might have missed with another type of screen,\u201d says Stephen Soisson, one of the lead researchers. Other scientists are delighted with the new compound, and say it could provoke renewed interest in natural compounds and in attacking the fatty-acid synthesis pathway. \u201cFrom a scientific point of view it is what you want \u2014 a new class against a new target,\u201d says Steven Projan of Wyeth Research in Pearl River, New York. But \u201cthe next steps are fraught with danger\u201d, warns microbiologist Carl Nathan of Weill Medical College of Cornell University in New York. \u201cThe obstacles are truly formidable.\u201d Platensimycin could stumble at one of many scientific, regulatory or financial hurdles. One concern is that it may be unstable in the body, because the research team had to infuse it continuously into mice to rid them of a  S. aureus  infection. The chemical might need extensive modification to make it more stable, and could prove useless if it has toxic side effects. Testing antibiotics in clinical trials is also tough and expensive. This is partly because the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) does not have clear guidelines for approving new antibiotics, says Frank Tally, chief scientific officer of Cubist Pharmaceuticals in Lexington, Massachusetts, which developed daptomycin. Even if platensimycin is approved for human use, it will probably meet the fate of its predecessors, as bacteria rapidly acquire resistance to it. \u201cIt might make it to the clinic and then fade because of drug resistance,\u201d Nathan says. With such a daunting task ahead, some microbiologists fear there is little incentive for Merck to develop the drug. Not only is the process hugely expensive, but the potential market for a new antibiotic \u2014 which is often used sparingly and administered for only a week or two \u2014 is small. This has prompted many pharmaceutical giants to cut back their antibiotic research programmes in recent years. The Merck researchers refuse to spell out their plans for platensimycin, although they hint that they are working on it. \u201cWe are still in the business of doing antibiotic research, and we wouldn't be if we didn't want to develop our own compounds,\u201d says Sheo Singh, another of Merck's lead researchers. Several solutions have been proposed to keep new drugs flowing into the clinic as micro-organisms overcome old ones. The Infectious Diseases Society of America proposed an array of regulatory measures in 2004 that might entice drug companies to develop antibiotics, such as revised FDA standards for the approval of antibiotics and tax breaks for work on such drugs (see  Nature   431 , 892\u2013893; 2004). Some researchers are turning to alternative measures to fight life-threatening bacteria, such as microbe-killing bacteriophage and vaccines. But many workers still think that novel antibiotics remain the best tried and tested way to combat microbes. They say platensimycin's discovery highlights the fact that compounds are still waiting to be found. \u201cWith a paper like this, people might start to reinvest in this area,\u201d Tally says, as it shows that new molecules can be found in well-known sources. \n                     Microbiology: Antibiotic stops 'ping-pong' match \n                   \n                     Superbug 'hit list' highlights hazard \n                   \n                     Superbugs abound in soil \n                   \n                     Bugs gain vital ground in their battle against drugs \n                   \n                     Antibiotics: A shot in the arm \n                   \n                     Drug companies snub antibiotics \n                   \n                     Antibiotics In Focus \n                   \n                     CDC on antimicrobial drug resistance \n                   \n                     Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) \n                   \n                     Merck \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Transforming the world's energy industry to stop the flood of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere might actually be quite cheap. Figures of tens of trillions of dollars are often cited, and used to question whether measures such as the Kyoto Protocol, which attempts to limit carbon emissions, are too expensive. But according to a suite of economic models released late last month, the costs of stabilizing carbon dioxide levels could be tiny \u2014 equivalent to setting back the growth of global GDP (gross domestic product) by less than 1% over 100 years; global GDP generally grows 2\u20133% each year. In some cases, the right policies for limiting carbon emissions could even create a surprising win\u2013win situation, leading to the stabilization of greenhouse gases and an increase in global wealth. It is a controversial conclusion with which not everyone agrees, but which the modellers say should be food for thought for policy-makers. \u201cIf we prepare properly and acknowledge that carbon will be constrained, it will be relatively cheap,\u201d says Michael Grubb, a climate-policy expert at Imperial College London. \u201cBut only if we do the right things.\u201d The models simulate a complex issue in economics: how government climate policies such as research investment or greenhouse-gas regulation can bring about technological development. It is obvious that technologies evolve, but the processes involved have been factored into economic models only since the late 1990s, in part because it is difficult to untangle how advances occur. The Innovation Modelling Comparison Project, published in a special issue of  The Energy Journal , is a two-year effort involving eleven different models that represent the latest thinking on the problem. The results are striking. Nine of the models predict that stabilizing carbon dioxide levels at 450 parts per million, widely seen as the most ambitious target worth discussing, would set back global GDP by less than 0.5% or so by 2100 (the other two produced figures of 2.1% and 6.2%). In each scenario, the regulation of greenhouse-gas emissions persuades the private sector to shift investment into low-carbon technologies, which then become competitive with traditional energy sources. In some cases, this shift in investment stimulates growth and actually boosts overall wealth. At least, that's the conclusion of two of the models \u2014 one developed at the University of Cambridge, UK, and the other at the Fondazione Eni Enrico Mattei, a centre for sustainable-development research in Italy. These models suggest that stabilization policies would give an added boost to global GDP of up to 1.7% over 100 years. They assume such climate policies will bring about side benefits, such as increased investment in new technologies. Ottmar Edenhofer, an economist at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany who edited the issue along with Grubb and others, says the new estimates of lost global GDP are significantly lower than previous ones, which put the range at 3\u201315%. They suggest the price will be a lot lower, agrees Terry Barker, an economist who helped developed the Cambridge model, especially as costs will be spread over 100 years. The models are likely to influence the next report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, due for publication next year. The authors hope the results will then filter through to governments. They say the cheapest stabilization route can only be achieved if industries are given a strong signal that carbon emissions will continue to be restricted \u2014 and that means the United States must join a future version of the Kyoto Protocol. Europe also needs to do more, say the authors, particularly in terms of investment in energy technologies, where it lags behind the United States. But some economists are wary of the results. Jae Edmonds of the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory in Richland, Washington, describes the models as a valuable \u201cintellectual experiment\u201d. But he questions the fact that most of the models emphasize learning-by-doing \u2014 a process by which technologies become cheaper as industry learns how to produce them more efficiently. Edmonds points out, for example, that many advances in hybrid vehicles have been made possible by developments in areas outside the automotive industry. It is hard to distinguish these advances from those due to learning-by-doing or research by automotive firms. If advances are attributed exclusively to one mechanism, Edmonds warns that the benefits of the process could be exaggerated and costs underestimated: \u201cWe don't necessarily have a good handle on how important different factors are and how they interact.\u201d \n                     The costs of global warming \n                   \n                     Climate change: is the US Congress bullying experts? \n                   \n                     Climate modellers go local to target California's politicians \n                   \n                     Regional climate change special \n                   \n                     Climate change in focus \n                   \n                     Innovation Modelling Comparison Project \n                   \n                     The Energy Journal \n                   \n                     Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

That's what many US geologists are asking in the wake of an announcement that President George W. Bush will nominate Myers to head the US Geological Survey (USGS). The agency spends nearly $1 billion each year on research, including earthquake monitoring, mapmaking and even biological studies. Myers has a PhD in geology and has spent much of his career in Alaska, working for oil companies and for the state \u2014 sometimes alone in remote locations, armed with a shotgun in case of grizzly bears. \u201cNever had to use it,\u201d he says. \u201cI keep a clean camp.\u201d He served in the Air Force Reserve for 26 years, for a time in intelligence in Alaska's far north. If confirmed by the Senate, Myers would be the first USGS director in decades to come neither from academia nor from within the agency. His history has made many academic geologists nervous, says Charles Groat, the agency's previous director. \u201cThe biggest question is, since he is so identified with oil and gas, what is his agenda?\u201d says Groat, now at the University of Texas, Austin. Myers worked most recently as head of Alaska's Division of Oil and Gas. In the past he has supported drilling for oil and gas in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge \u2014 a protected region of Alaska. And this has spooked some environmentalists. But if he gets the USGS job, Myers says, he would stay out of any decision making: \u201cMy job is strictly to provide the data, to help people understand the data and its limitations.\u201d Last autumn, Myers resigned in protest after Alaska's governor dismissed Tom Irwin, then natural resources commissioner for the state. The dispute was over a natural-gas pipeline deal between Alaska and major oil companies. Linda Rowan, government affairs director at the American Geological Institute in Alexandria, Virginia, says she is reassured by the incident: \u201cIf he's willing to resign from his very prominent position in Alaska, he's not really going to be political.\u201d That is, of course, the big question.

The hypothesis that migratory birds are responsible for spreading avian flu over long distances has taken another knock. Last year, an outbreak of the deadly H5N1 strain in thousands of migratory birds at Qinghai Lake in western China provided what seemed the first firm evidence for the idea. Because the lake is so remote, experts assumed infected birds had flown up from southern China. But it has now emerged that, since 2003, one of the key migratory species affected, the bar-headed goose, has been artificially reared near the lake. The breeding farms \u2014 part of an experimental programme to both domesticate the birds and release them to repopulate wild stocks \u2014 raise the possibility that farmed birds were the source of the outbreak. Roy Wadia, a World Health Organization (WHO) spokesman in Beijing, agrees that, if confirmed, the finding is \u201cimportant\u201d, as changing the breeding practice might help control the infection. Yi Guan, a virologist at the University of Hong Kong, co-authored a  Nature  paper last July that suggested migrating birds caused the outbreak (see  Nature   436 , 191\u2013192; 2005). Guan says he had heard rumours of the programme when he submitted his paper, but couldn't confirm them. There is no proof that China's breeding programme caused the Qinghai outbreak, but it does raise questions, he says. \u201cThe cultivation of bar-headed geese increases the chance for these birds to mix with infected domestic poultry.\u201d Ironically, the breeding programme was revealed by Chinese press agencies reporting on the government's efforts to boost agriculture and the environment in the region ahead of the opening of the Qinghai\u2013Tibet railway in July; the railway is expected to promote tourism and economic growth. Richard Thomas of BirdLife International in Cambridge, UK, spotted the press cuttings, and posted English translations to a blog ( http://www.drmartinwilliams.com ). Whether farmed migrant birds caused the outbreak or not, it's a \u201ccautionary tale\u201d, says Ken Shortridge, a veteran avian-flu researcher in China. He argues that such a programme does not sufficiently take into account the threat of H5N1. The idea that migrating birds didn't carry the virus to Qinghai after all would fit with other recent evidence. Juan Lubroth, a senior animal-health officer at the UN Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO), says he is now sceptical that migrants can carry the virus over long distances. For example, the current spring migration from Africa to Europe is almost over, with no sign of outbreaks. The FAO has also checked 20,000 wild birds in Africa and found no H5N1. \n                     Avian flu and the New World \n                   \n                     Doubts hang over source of bird flu spread \n                   \n                     Ornithologists on the front line \n                   \n                     Avian flu: H5N1 virus outbreak in migratory waterfowl \n                   \n                     Flu in wild birds sparks fears of mutating virus \n                   \n                     Avian Flu mashup (requires Google Earth) \n                   \n                     Bird Flu in focus \n                   \n                     Avian Flu web focus \n                   \n                     Avian flu web resources on Connotea \n                   \n                     FAO avian flu site \n                   \n                     WHO avian flu site \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

A German physicist has devised a way of answering the \u2018Hot or not?\u2019 question for his discipline. If it stands up to scrutiny, it could be used to rate topics across the sciences. In physics, the results show that hotness \u2014 measured by a parameter known as  \n               m \n                \u2014 correlates well with the promise of future wealth... and that promise is greatest in nanotechnology. \n             \n               12.85 Carbon nanotubes \n             Super-strong materials and blisteringly fast electronic circuits: the potential applications of these tiny carbon tubes, discovered in 1991, are so enticing that everyone is pouring money into the field. \n               8.75 Nanowires \n             Less well studied than nanotubes, but the possible uses are similar.

Researchers are now aiming to make hard disks even more powerful. \n               How the topics were ranked \n             The ranking is an extension of a recently proposed system for rating the research output of individual scientists. The  h  index uses the highest number of papers a scientist has published that have each received at least that number of citations: for example, a researcher with an  h  of 50 has written 50 papers that have each had at least 50 citations (see  Nature   436 , 900; 2005). The index has attracted interest from bibliometricians, but was first described only last year and has yet to be studied in depth. Michael Banks, a PhD student at the Max Planck Institute for Solid State Research in Stuttgart, Germany, totted up the  h  index for physics topics, rather than people, and then calculated the parameter  m  by dividing by the number of years over which the papers involved had been published ( http://www.arxiv.org/abs/physics/0604216 ). \n               Jim Giles \n             Do you agree with the winners?

How would you spend the profits from an oil well? That question was on the mind of about 200 Arab scientists who gathered in Doha, Qatar, late last month. The country's head of state, Emir Hammad bin Khalifa Al-Thani, has devoted a chunk of Qatar's fossil-fuel profits to research, and the region's expatriate scientists were brought together to advise how best to invest it. Get it right, said attendees, and the money could help create an internationally respected science base for the Arab world. \u201cIf it succeeds, it will change the whole region,\u201d says Hilal Lashuel, a Yemeni neuro\u2013scientist at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH) in Lausanne. \u201cArabs will compete for the first time.\u201d Qatar is already gaining scientists' attention in part because the country has recently transformed its university system. The tiny Gulf state, which has a population of less than 900,000, supports Western standards of living thanks to its substantial oil and gas fields. But those reserves are limited. Hence Qatar's decision to jump on the knowledge-economy bandwagon and create Education City. The 2,500-acre campus on the outskirts of Doha hosts undergraduate teaching branches of several well-known US universities, such as Texas A&M. By replicating Western academic culture in the Gulf, the country's leaders hope to eventually attract 2,000 students annually to what could become the region's premier teaching facility. Several hundred students are already enrolled. Education City has been bankrolled by the Qatar Foundation for Education, Science and Community Development. This is funded by an endowment from Al-Thani that officials say runs to billions of dollars. With this education centre up and running, the foundation is now turning its attention to applied research and the income-generating technologies that flow from it. The emir has set aside profits from one of the country's oil wells for the purpose. Combined with a contribution from the foundation's endowment, Qatar will have a dedicated research fund worth hundreds of millions of dollars a year. That may be small change in international terms, but Arab scientists say that the other components of Qatar's research vision show that the country means business. Foreign labs are being enticed to a science park on the Education City site, for example, by offers of state-of-the-art research facilities and liberal intellectual-property agreements. All the labs have to do is provide the staff. It is a deal that has attracted interest from research institutions such as Imperial College London and Tokyo University. \n               Tempting talent \n             Tidu Maini, Imperial's pro-rector, says his university is working with the foundation on plans for a diabetes genome centre. The Gulf region has one of the highest rates of diabetes in the world, making it the ideal place to probe the genetics of the disease. Although plans are at an early stage, Maini says research groups could be set up this year at Imperial and the Hamad General Hospital in Qatar. The researchers would eventually move to the new genome centre, which Maini says could open in about three years. He would like every newborn child in Qatar, and their parents, to be genotyped in order to build up a database that could be probed for diabetes studies. Qatar is importing Western practices as well as personnel. The country's research fund, for example, will be administered by independent peer-review panels. These will be composed of researchers from home and abroad, and modelled on processes followed by organizations such as the US National Institutes of Health. Fathy Saoud, a parasitologist who sits on the Qatar foundation's board of directors, says that grant applications for biomedical, environmental and computing projects will be considered in about a year's time. At last month's conference, held from 24 to 26 April, expatriate Arab researchers talked about how the Qatar project could boost science investment across the region. Researchers say that if the initiative takes off, it could force neighbouring countries to launch similar projects and ultimately reverse the current exodus of bright students from the region to Europe and the United States. \u201cIt's an idea whose time has come,\u201d says Abdelwahab El-Affendi, a political scientist at the University of Westminster in London who attended the Doha meeting. \u201cThere are large numbers of Arab expatriate scholars, who are good in their own areas, but their talents are not being used to advance research in the Arab world.\u201d One potentially divisive issue concerns the involvement of the region's research powerhouse: Israel. Delegates at the meeting said that they were keen to collaborate with Israeli colleagues, but that they did not know whether that could happen before peace was reached with the Palestinians. \u201cI don't think that Israelis can be involved at this juncture,\u201d says El-Affendi. \u201cWe have to wait for a genuine peace process.\u201d \n                     New biotech oasis? \n                   \n                     Egypt boosts its academic entrepreneurs \n                   \n                     Middle Eastern promise as synchrotron wins approval \n                   \n                     Qatar Foundation \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Arctic climate research is suffering as manned weather stations are being closed in Canada, Russia and the United States, some meteorologists complain. Since 1990, around a quarter of the 500-odd manned meteorological stations in North America and Siberia have been shut in order to save money. Some have been replaced with automated monitoring stations, but other closures have completely halted data flow from those sites. Among other variables, these stations measure winter precipitation and snow depth \u2014 key factors for assessing climatic and hydrological changes in the Arctic, where warming is more pronounced than at lower latitudes (see  page 146 ). \u201cEach station less means we have one important grid point less for validating our models,\u201d says Konrad Steffen, an ice specialist at the University of Colorado in Boulder. The reasons for the closures vary, but essentially come down to cost. A manned weather station can cost more than US$100,000 a year to operate. Automated stations, around 3,000 of which are scattered across the Arctic, cost approximately $30,000 a year, but can fall short in terms of data quality and reliability, many scientists say. \u201cIt's just a terrible mess if there is no human around who can go out and check the equipment,\u201d says Jessie Cherry, a hydrologist at the University of Alaska in Fairbanks. \u201cThe main problems are mechanical failures, frozen gauges and under-catch of snowfall.\u201d National weather services are required to report all weather observations to the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), a UN agency based in Geneva, Switzerland. But the WMO cannot stop governments from closing stations. In Canada's far north, a switch to automated measurements and the closure of several manned stations has reduced by 50% the number of stations with records suitable for monitoring snow cover. But Thomas Nichols, director-general of weather and environmental monitoring at the government agency Environment Canada, argues that the country is still collecting plenty of data. Canada has installed 45 automated Arctic stations over the past four years; some of these have been built at new locations, and others have replaced manned stations or ageing automated stations. But hydrologists say data from the automated stations can be suspect. \u201cIt is difficult to believe what you are seeing,\u201d says Cherry, who has just completed a hydrologic study in Siberia based on the 60-year record of seven Russian weather stations (see doi:10.1038/news060403-9). \u201cGiven the number of possible biases out there, we just don't trust the raw gauge data.\u201d Decreasing monitoring ability on the ground is also limiting the value of satellite-based snow and ice observations, which need to be calibrated against ground measurements. The situation is similar in Antarctica. Russia and South Africa have recently closed three manned stations there, which they plan to replace with automatic stations. Around 20 manned stations remain on the continent, along with 25 automatic ones. Getting real-time data is a problem for the WMO's entire Global Climate Observing System (GCOS), says Phil Jones, a climate researcher at the University of East Anglia, UK. The GCOS collects data from about 1,000 terrestrial stations worldwide, 10% of which are in polar regions. But each month, 30% of the stations don't send data, or send them late. \u201cData flow is alarmingly bad,\u201d says Jones. \u201cIt wouldn't take much effort to improve it, but some countries just don't seem to be concerned about data quality.\u201d The lack of good data also troubles the Greenland research community. In northern Greenland, where glacier movement may be speeding up substantially, the scarcity of data is limiting scientists' ability to accurately model the phenomenon, says Eric Rignot, a glaciologist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena. \u201cThere are too many unobserved variables, such as glacier thickness close to the coast and meltwater movement,\u201d he says. Scientists hope that the governments of Arctic countries will set up new manned monitoring facilities as a contribution to the International Polar Year, in 2007\u20132008.

The devastating tsunami of 26 December 2004 is still making itself felt in Sri Lanka; though more than 16 months have passed, the well water in many coastal areas of that country is still undrinkable, a study has found. The Indian Ocean tsunami, created by an earthquake off the coast of Sumatra, Indonesia, killed more than 25,000 people in Sri Lanka. The flood also destroyed, or contaminated with sea water and pollutants, almost all the wells within reach of the waves, which in places penetrated up to 1.5 kilometres inland. Most of the rural or semi-urban population of Sri Lanka's southern and eastern coastlines rely on groundwater taken from some 40,000 shallow wells, each of which serves several families. Problems with this well water still persist today, according to a 14-strong team of scientists. The team, including geologists and water engineers from Sri Lanka, the United States and Denmark, began surveying the problem in February 2005. They found that in most places the aquifer, which is normally fed and replenished by monsoon rainfall, shows little, if any, sign of recovery 1 . About 67-100% of wells that had been flooded, and 17-50% of those that escaped the floodwaters, were still not suitable for drinking 7 months after the tsunami, notes Karen Villholth of the International Water Management Institute in Colombo, Sri Lanka. Vilhoth is a co-author of the paper, and leads a well recovery initiative in Sri Lanka's Batticaloa and Ampara districts. \"Levels of salinity were still extraordinarily high in September, as was cross-contamination with pesticides and insecticides from upland fields,\" says Jayantha Obeysekera, a Sri Lanka-born hydrologist at South Florida Water Management District in West Palm Beach. \"What makes the situation worse is that there exists no water-control monitoring system,\" he says.  \n              Here comes the rain \n            One reason for the continued saltwater contamination is that Sri Lanka received relatively little monsoon rain in the first months after the tsunami. The monsoon was substantial again in December last year. But the researchers say it will take several more monsoon seasons until rainwater will have sufficiently flushed the aquifer in some of the most-affected regions. Local people's attempts to clean the wells after the flood have sometimes done more harm than good, the team found. Excessive pumping, for example, only allowed more sea water to enter the aquifer from below and caused numerous wells to collapse. Besides, polluted water that was pumped out of wells was often disposed of improperly, allowing contaminants to seep back into the aquifer. Sand mining, and enhanced beach erosion caused by the tsunami, are also adding to the slow rate of recovery, the scientists say. \"It would be unfair to say that the locals or helpers were doing anything wrong,\" cautions Tissa Illangasekare, a groundwater hydrologist at the Colorado School of Mines in Golden, and lead author of the study. \"Given the enormity of the disaster it is no wonder that there was just no sufficient level of preparedness.\"  \n              Be prepared \n            Hundreds of thousands of households in Sri Lanka have become accustomed to using clean water trucked in by the government or supplied by various relief organizations. Plans are now underway to pipe water to many coastal villages, and expand centralized sewage collection. However, fights flaring up between Sri Lankan government forces and Tamil separatists could hamper relief efforts in some of the most severely affected villages on the island's east coast.  The researchers hope that their study of the hydrogeological impact of the tsunami could be used as a first step towards developing internationally recognized emergency guidelines for many other areas threatened by hurricanes, storm surges and sea-level rise. Illangasekare is now organizing a NATO-funded workshop on water security, which will be held in Croatia in autumn. \"Tsunamis don't happen too often,\" says Illangasekare. \"So when you have the opportunity you should look as closely as possible at the problems that can arise, and try to learn the lessons.\" \n             Visit our  \n             \n                 newsblog \n               \n              to read and post comments about this story. \n           \n                   Tsunami in focus \n                 \n                   Tsunami special \n                 Reprints and Permissions"},

In the end, the virus turned out to be a strain that was not very harmful, but the event sheds light on what might happen if H5N1 is detected in the United States. The country has weathered three major outbreaks of highly pathogenic bird flu before (see  \u2018Past US outbreaks\u2019 ). \u2018Low-pathogenic\u2019 bird flu, which kills few infected birds, occurs far more regularly. In the latest case, New Jersey's agriculture department made a public announcement about the discovery of an avian-flu strain \u2014 but it left out salient details. The announcement on 28 April did not mention when or specifically where the infection was detected, saying only that preliminary tests had marked it as negative for the neuraminidase protein N1. The statement did not mention the haemagglutinin protein;  Nature  learned later that the state had a faint positive for H5, which can occur in both high- and low-pathogenic strains. The first samples were tested on 21 April. Later confirmatory tests by the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) laboratory in Ames, Iowa, failed because technicians there could not grow the virus. In the meantime, other birds in the market had been killed and disposed of. The market was later reopened. If a low-pathogenic strain of bird flu is discovered, then individual states, not the federal government, are responsible for alerting the public \u2014 and officials say this all went as planned. \u201cThe timeline was exactly as it should be,\u201d claims Andrea Morgan, veterinary administrator for the USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service. \u201cThe response that New Jersey launched was appropriate.\u201d But it was misleading, critics argue. Jody Lanard, a risk-communication specialist based in Princeton, New Jersey, has worked as a senior adviser in pandemic influenza communication to the World Health Organization. She notes that the state's two press releases omitted the fact that the strain was H5, focusing instead on the fact that it was not N1. \u201cThey are afraid the public will hear H5 and go nuts \u2014 a case of official panic about panic,\u201d she says. \u201cIf they really think the public is that fragile, they might be tempted to hold back lots of preliminary information, and delay issuing material when it really matters.\u201d Karen Eggert, a spokeswoman for the USDA, says the department is still working out how and when it would alert the public to outbreaks of highly pathogenic strains such as H5N1. In the interests of openness, officials are considering announcing it immediately after the first confirmatory molecular tests. \n                     Disease surveillance needs a revolution \n                   \n                     Doubts hang over source of bird flu spread \n                   \n                     Bird flu reaches Africa \n                   \n                     Ornithologists on the front line \n                   \n                     Nature's Avian Flu mashup \n                   \n                     Bird Flu in focus \n                   \n                     Avian Flu web focus \n                   \n                     WHO avian influenza information \n                   \n                     US Dept Agriculture (USDA) avian flu page \n                   \n                     Southeast Poultry Research Laboratory \n                   \n                     The Pan American Health Organization \n                   \n                     Google Earth \n                   \n                     Connotea resources on avian flu \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

What will happen when it does? Declan Butler and Jacqueline Ruttimann investigate. The H5N1 virus once seemed a problem that was lurking in someone else's backyard farm. But since last summer, the lethal avian influenza virus has surged out of southeast Asia into Europe, the Middle East and Africa. Fifty-one countries \u2014 36 this year alone \u2014 have now experienced outbreaks. The New World is as yet untouched, but many experts consider it inevitable that the virus will reach North and South America. This area is home to the world's largest poultry exporters, Brazil and the United States. And although government and industry officials say they are well prepared for the arrival of H5N1, others argue that they have yet to take on board the full extent of the challenge. \u201cWhen H5N1 arrives,\u201d says Mark Cackler, the World Bank's agriculture manager for Latin America and the Caribbean, \u201cit will concentrate minds wonderfully.\u201d Trade, smuggling and migratory birds are all potential routes for H5N1 to reach the Americas (see  page 138 ). How it arrives is ultimately less important than stopping a subsequent spread of the disease, says Juan Lubroth of the UN Food and Agriculture Organization. And here there is no debate as to what causes spread, he adds: it's not migratory birds, but \u201chuman actions, trade and husbandry practices\u201d. Experience in Asia and Europe provides best practices on controlling avian flu, says Jim Butler, director-general of the Inter-American Institute for Cooperation on Agriculture in San Jose, Costa Rica. \u201cWe don't need to reinvent everything.\u201d The task for the Americas, he says, is more about \u201cbuilding consciousness\u201d of the risks and existing best practices. Such practices include setting up surveillance and diagnostic capacities that can quickly detect any initial outbreak. But despite all best efforts, some virus will always go undetected, so countries must also have policies in place to make their farming systems more resilient. Such policies can be as simple as requiring the poultry industry to disinfect all material and people moving in and out of farms. Another is to reorganize national poultry industries into regional \u2018cells\u2019 that operate independently of one another, so that if one goes down with H5N1, the others do not. France prepared by using both approaches, and so far the H5N1 found there has been stopped in its tracks. Turkey did neither well, and has suffered persistent outbreaks. The well-developed animal health services in the United States and Canada have implemented similar measures to those in France, and are widely expected to quickly contain any outbreak of H5N1. Unlike regions of southeast Asia and Africa, where poultry live outdoors and mingle freely with each other and with wild birds, US flocks are highly concentrated in industrial farms, where birds are raised indoors, isolated from external contaminants. One potential weakness is the popular live markets in California and the northeastern states. In the northeast, these markets have sustained an avian flu virus of low pathogenicity, H7N2, since 1994. In the past, as many as 60% of birds sampled have carried flu viruses, although control measures have reduced the levels. Such live markets \u201ccontinue to be a major source of avian influenza viruses and a risk for introduction to commercial poultry operations\u201d. This is what David Swayne and David Suarez of the US agriculture department's main poultry research laboratory in Athens, Georgia, told an influential 2004 workshop on pandemic planning that was organized by the US National Academies. South America is also preparing well, experts say, as it has decades of experience of handling other highly contagious diseases, such as foot-and-mouth disease. Lubroth gives the continent good marks for \u201chigh awareness favouring quick detection and response\u201d. Brazil's poultry industry is both larger and more complex than that in the United States. Backyard farms are common in the poor northeastern part of the country, and smallholdings are scattered throughout urban areas and along the Amazon. But its core production remains in large commercial farms, which are well aware of the economic risks of H5N1, says Lubroth. \u201cIf H5N1 entered,\u201d he predicts, \u201cthey would stamp it out quickly to preserve the main industry.\u201d That view is overly optimistic, argues Cackler, who sits on the avian-flu taskforce for the World Bank. Many South American countries, he says, have only recently woken up to H5N1 as something they might need to worry about. He recalls speaking to the agriculture minister of \u201cone to-be-unnamed country\u201d last November, who \u201cjust didn't get it; H5N1 was nothing to worry about\u201d. Cackler met him again in January, after H5N1 had ripped across Europe. \u201cThis time, the guy got it.\u201d \n                     Disease surveillance needs a revolution \n                   \n                     Doubts hang over source of bird flu spread \n                   \n                     Bird flu reaches Africa \n                   \n                     Ornithologists on the front line \n                   \n                     Avian Flu mashup (requires Google Earth) \n                   \n                     Bird Flu in focus \n                   \n                     Avian Flu web focus \n                   \n                     WHO avian influenza information \n                   \n                     USDA avian flu page \n                   \n                     Southeast Poultry Research Laboratory \n                   \n                     The Pan American Health Organization \n                   \n                     Google Earth \n                   \n                     Connotea resources on avian flu \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

The global debate over the high cost of drugs reaches Geneva this month, when the governing body of the World Health Organization (WHO) will consider two proposals aimed at reshaping the forces that drive medical research and development. The proposals direct the WHO to act on two controversial issues: the lack of affordable, effective medicines for people in poor countries, and the international intellectual-property system that governs the distribution of medical treatments. Developed countries \u2014 especially the United States \u2014 have in the past strongly opposed such interventions, perceiving them as a threat to the drug industry. But this is the first time the issues have been addressed by the WHO, and advocates for reform are optimistic. Many believe that recent trends \u2014 such as the massive and growing cost of health care in the United States, the scarcity of treatments for avian influenza, and the lack of biodefence countermeasures against diseases such as anthrax \u2014 are persuading the Western world that the current system does not meet all public-health needs. The first proposal to come before the World Health Assembly, the WHO's governing body, is raised by Kenya and Brazil, and calls on the agency to consider measures that would boost the development of new drugs. The reform movement stems from a growing concern about the lack of treatments, vaccines and diagnostic products for diseases that affect developing countries. For instance, one study found that only 1% of drugs brought to market between 1975 and 1999 targeted tuberculosis and tropical diseases such as malaria (P. Trouiller  et al .  Lancet  359, 2188\u20132194; 2002). The other 99% targeted disorders more relevant to the developed world, such as cancer and heart disease. But the lack of new treatments is now affecting richer countries too. Other studies have found, for example, that an increasing percentage of new drugs are slight variations of already-approved medications. \u201cThere's possibly a recognition that something's going to have to change,\u201d says Tim Hubbard, a genome biologist at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute in Cambridge, UK, who has become heavily involved in the issue. \u201cEveryone can see that spending on research and development is going up, but the number of new drugs coming to market is going down.\u201d The proposal has been endorsed by a long list of consumer groups, activists and scientists, including Hubbard. It doesn't endorse specific reforms, although advocates have suggested many options, from an international fund for research into neglected diseases, to a cash prize for developers of innovative drugs. The important thing, they say, is that the WHO commits to tackling the issue. \u201cIt's been an uphill struggle to get the WHO interested in this question, and if you look at the enormous health needs out there you think, how the hell can this be the case?\u201d says Ellen't Hoen of Geneva-based M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res. The second proposal asks the WHO to act on the issue of whether patent laws restrict access to essential medicines. It follows a report commissioned by the WHO, released on 3 April, which concluded that the patent system is not working to drive innovation in drugs needed by poor countries. It makes 50 recommendations for action. The proposals will be heard when the assembly meets on 22\u201327 May.

Emma Marris investigates whether the medical community's refusal to assist could help end the practice. Do no harm. Nearly all US MDs and PhDs recite this three-word oath instinctively when asked why they object to helping with executions. \u201cIt violates our ethical oath and erodes public trust,\u201d says Priscilla Ray, head of ethics at the American Medical Association (AMA), which prohibits members from participating in executions. Even helping to design a more humane protocol would disregard the AMA code, Ray says. \u201cFormulating a way to kill somebody would violate the spirit of the policy.\u201d As a result of that stance, lethal injections \u2014 the dominant method of execution in the United States \u2014 are generally carried out by technicians without scientific or medical training, and the protocol does not seem to have been reviewed in 30 years. Typically, prisoners are injected with three drugs in sequence meant to knock out, paralyze and then kill (see graphic, below). But many experts are concerned that because of that lack of training, the first drug does not always knock the condemned out properly, leaving him or her paralyzed but excruciatingly conscious as the lungs stop moving, and burning potassium chloride races towards the heart. None of this seems until recently to have hindered the popularity of the technique. It was devised in 1977 by Oklahoma medical examiner Jay Chapman, despite his admitted lack of experience. It was meant to be more humane than the electric chair, which was occasionally setting inmates on fire, and the method has since been copied by 36 other states, apparently without any modification. It has killed more than 800 prisoners so far in the United States, and other countries, including China, Guatemala and the Philippines, have adopted the method in recent years. US prisoners have brought cases against their states for years, arguing that lethal injection is a \u201ccruel and unusual punishment\u201d, and therefore prohibited by the constitution. But they have not made significant progress in the courts. Now, however, the tide may be turning. In recent months, several death-row inmates and their lawyers have had some successes, helped by evidence that as many as 43% of prisoners may be conscious until the point of death (L. G. Koniaris, T. A. Zimmers, D. A. Lubarsky and J. P. Sheldon  Lancet   365,  1412\u20131414; 2005). Last week for example, the Supreme Court heard arguments on whether condemned murderer Clarence Edward Hill can use a particular legal avenue to object to the way the state of Florida plans to execute him. Of the judges involved in the case, Justice Anthony Kennedy seemed upset by Florida's insistence on the standard protocol, asking: \u201cDoesn't the state have some minimal obligation to do research to find a method as humane as possible?\u201d If the Supreme Court lets Hill try this method of appeal in the district court, they may see it on their docket in the near future. In California, executions have been suspended until a September hearing rules on the constitutionality of the method used there. The hearing could have been avoided had the state been able to fulfill a judge's order that murderer and rapist Michael Morales be executed by a single dose of anaesthetic administered by a licensed practitioner, or that a trained anaesthesiologist be present. The state couldn't find any medical personnel willing to participate. And in North Carolina last month, a judge ruled that the execution of Willie Brown Jr, a convicted murderer, could proceed only if a medical expert ensured Brown was fully anaesthetized when the final two drugs in the sequence were injected; anonymous medical personnel were persuaded to take part. \n               Ethical dilemma \n             These latest cases place doctors and scientists, who might be able to come up with an alternative method, centre-stage in the debate. \u201cThere is a real problem here,\u201d says Richard Dieter, executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center, a clearinghouse, an agency based in Washington DC with no official position on the death penalty itself. \u201cLethal injection is a medical procedure. I think that it almost requires the presence of the medical community.\u201d Nathan Barankin, spokesman for the California attorney-general's office believes that arguing this need for trained overseers is the operational strategy of campaigns against the death penalty. \u201cThe goal of death-penalty opponents is to get a court order that says that lethal injections can only be administered by licensed professionals, because the ethics of medical professionals prohibit them from participating.\u201d Opinion among medics about the stance they should take \u2014 violate \u2018do no harm\u2019, or allow prisoners to die in pain? \u2014 is divided, however, and often not along predictable lines. Atul Gawande, an assistant professor of surgery at Harvard Medical School in Boston, Massachusetts, interviewed several doctors who help with executions for a March article in the  New England Journal of Medicine  (A. Gawande,  N. Engl. J. Med.   354,  1221\u20131229; 2006). Gawande supports the death penalty, but argues that doctors ought not use their skills to do anything but heal. \u201cIf I have to choose between core principles of medical ethics and the death penalty, I will choose medical ethics,\u201d he says. \u201cIf the only way we can do an execution and have it stand up to constitutional scrutiny is with physician involvement, then it is more important to have physicians not be involved and to lose the death penalty.\u201d David Lubarsky, chair of the anaesthesiology department at the University of Miami in Florida, opposes capital punishment. He is a co-author of the  Lancet  study published last year, which analysed the amount of anaesthetic in the blood of 49 executed prisoners. Some other anaesthesiologists, also opposed to the death penalty, vehemently disagree with Lubarsky and colleagues' finding that almost half of the executed prisoners had been awake for their deaths. They question the assumption that the level of anaesthetic post-mortem would be the same as at the time of death. The dispute continues. The research, even though it only used post-mortem records, presented its own ethical challenges. Lubarsky says he worried that if the data showed lethal injection was knocking people out without fail, he would have two opposing ethical obligations: \u201cWould we be scientifically ethically obligated to publish the results, which might go against physicians' ethics for aiding the death penalty?\u201d He decided to publish whatever the outcome. \n               Punishment by pain \n             Lubarsky argues that more than voluntary non-participation is called for. \u201cI believe that if death-penalty opponents were serious, they would seek the names of the physicians who participate under the freedom of information act,\u201d he says, in the hope that those doctors would then lose their licenses. Many physicians who help with executions do so despite being opposed to the death penalty, however. Carlo Musso, a Georgia physician, is one of the few willing to be named. He works in jails and feels both that the death penalty is wrong and that his patients deserve a good death. Musso was reportedly summoned to Washington by the AMA as a result of going public in Gawande's article, and could be kicked out of the association. Sara Tofte, an author of a report on lethal injection released last week by New York-based Human Rights Watch. She is among those who hope that if physicians and other experts refuse to touch the death penalty, it will be impossible for states to continue the practice. But she says she is disheartened by the research she did for the report: \u201cI think a number of individuals say \u2018Who cares if the inmate feels a little bit of pain? If they murdered someone, maybe they deserve to feel pain.\u2019\u201d The argument that lethal injection is inhumane \u201cis coming from a scientific and legal perspective \u2014 it's not a popular groundswell coming from the public\u201d, says Dieter. He does not believe the stalemate will damage the death penalty. \u201cEven if 100% of doctors refuse to participate, it will not be enough,\u201d he says. \u201cThe state will do it without them.\u201d \n                     DNA tests put death penalty under fire \n                   \n                     Human Rights Watch report on lethal injections \n                   \n                     AMA policy on capital punishment \n                   \n                     NEJM  essay: Why Physicians Participate in Executions \n                   \n                     The Lancet  Inadequate anaesthesia in lethal injection for execution \n                   \n                     First reply to  The Lancet  article \n                   \n                     Second reply to  The Lancet  article \n                   \n                     California court ruling in Morales case \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Monterey, California Hurricanes may be becoming more intense because of global warming, but so is research on the topic. Last week, meteorologists gathered in Monterey, California \u2014 the meeting was to have been held in New Orleans \u2014 to hear new evidence supporting the proposed link between rising sea surface temperatures and more-powerful hurricanes. The fresh crop of research was triggered by two papers arguing for that connection, published by coincidence during the height of the devastating Atlantic hurricane season of 2005 (K. Emanuel  Nature   436 , 686\u2013688; 2005; P. Webster  et al .  Science   309,  1844\u20131846; 2005). The effects of global warming, many say, are already in evidence. \u201cIt's not going to happen in the future \u2014 it is actually happening now,\u201d says Greg Holland of the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colorado. But not all are convinced, and there were raised voices in the hallway discussions at the American Meteorological Society meeting. At a lively panel discussion on 25 April, the moderator accepted audience questions only on written cards, and admonished the speakers not to indulge in personal attacks. This prompted Christopher Landsea, of the National Hurricane Center in Miami, to quip: \u201cI get along personally with everyone in the field, and I want to continue that \u2014 even if they're wrong.\u201d At issue is whether the historical record of cyclones is complete enough for accurate conclusions to be drawn about changes from past patterns. Many researchers called for the databases to be brought up to date by including modern assessments of past storms, including their intensities. It is a daunting task that, for now, is being done only for the Atlantic basin by Landsea and his colleagues. Even given the gaps in the database, several new studies suggested that rising sea surface temperatures are having a noticeable effect on cyclones. Peter Webster of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta, co-author of one of last year's papers, presented data hinting that not only are hurricanes growing more intense over time, but that the length of the storm season has increased as well. Starting from 1950, he told the meeting, the storm season has grown longer in the Atlantic by about five days per decade, in the northeastern Pacific by eight days per decade, and in the northwestern Pacific by ten days per decade. In Britain, researchers at the Benfield Hazard Research Centre in Surrey have run climate simulations suggesting that half the recent rise in hurricane activity in the North Atlantic can be explained by the observed increase in sea surface temperature in the region where these hurricanes develop. A warmer ocean would, in theory, provide more fuel for hurricanes to intensify. And in Japan, a team has used the Earth Simulator supercomputer to run high-resolution simulations of global climate, both in today's conditions and in a world warmed by higher levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide. Preliminary results suggest that, in the latter scenario, the number of tropical cyclones would drop by about 30% worldwide. But the number would rise in the Atlantic, and storm intensity would increase worldwide (K. Oouchi  et al .  J. Meteorol. Soc. Jap.   84,  259\u2013276; 2006). Kerry Emanuel, a hurricane expert at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and author of the other paper published last year, says that many of these models need more work before firm conclusions can be drawn. But he spent his time as a panellist demolishing another popular tenet of climate research: that a natural temperature cycle known as the Atlantic Multi-Decadal Oscillation (AMO) controls the formation of Atlantic storms during the peak of the hurricane season. Removing the oscillation would remove one of the last arguments that hurricane patterns are driven by a natural cycle. \u201cThere may be such a thing as an AMO, but it's not affecting the sea surface temperature in the North Atlantic in the late summer,\u201d says Emanuel. Few of these studies have appeared in peer-reviewed journals yet, and not everyone is persuaded by the conclusions. Johnny Chan, of the City University of Hong Kong, presented data suggesting that in the northwestern Pacific, numbers of typhoons do not track with rising sea surface temperatures. One major critic is William Gray, a longtime forecaster at Colorado State University, Fort Collins, whose climate theories have been criticized by many researchers. He continued to insist that hurricanes are driven more by natural patterns of ocean circulation than by human-induced global warming. \u201cI don't care what anyone says \u2014 in the end the data will prove this to be true,\u201d he says. \u201cWhy try to read all these demonic influences into the system?\u201d Forecasters, including Gray, are predicting that a busier-than-usual Atlantic hurricane season will start on 1 June. \n                     Hurricane link to climate change is hazy \n                   \n                     Storms get fewer but fiercer \n                   \n                     Hurricane seasons warm up \n                   \n                     Trouble brews over contested trend in hurricanes \n                   \n                     American Meteorological Society Conference \n                   \n                     National Hurricane Center \n                   \n                     Joint Typhoon Warning Centre \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Chemists desperate to save their university department from closure have launched a \u00a31.2-million (US$2-million) fund-raising drive. The proposed closure is part of a growing trend in Britain that many say is triggered by insufficient funding for chemistry courses, and it has drawn condemnation from chemists around the world. But researchers at the University of Sussex in Brighton are fighting back. They aim to persuade pharmaceutical companies to come up with the cash, which would fund three new posts in the department for five years. Gerry Lawless, head of chemistry at Sussex, hopes the pledges would be enough to convince officials at the university to keep the subject alive. Although such enterprises are relatively common on US campuses, they are more unusual in Britain. \u201cI think it's inherent in British culture that we don't like going cap in hand,\u201d says Lawless. \u201cBut that shouldn't be the case.\u201d The crisis started when an investment strategy championed by the university's vice-chancellor, Alasdair Smith, became public in March this year. The controversial plan proposed to end teaching and research in physical and inorganic chemistry, and to create a new department of chemical biology. \u201cSussex has not been accepting chemistry students at a high enough rate to maintain a broad chemistry department,\u201d explains Smith. The department's annual intake has stood at just 20\u201325 students for several years. Although applications are up by 40% this year, \u201cconverting applications into acceptances is by no means guaranteed\u201d, Smith says. The department has also lost five key staff to other universities in the past three years, reducing coverage of certain areas of chemistry and making it difficult to attract enough government funding for teaching. Smith says this will result in a substantial deficit if the situation continues. But eminent chemists around the world have reacted with dismay, bombarding Smith with letters of stinging criticism (see  \u2018Messages of rebuke\u2019 ). Former Sussex chemist and Nobel laureate Harry Kroto even weighed in with a video message to the university senate. The plan for a chemical-biology department has now been dropped, says Lawless, but chemistry still faces an uncertain future. Smith has also been criticized by the UK Parliament's Science and Technology Committee for not consulting with members of Sussex's chemistry department before unveiling his plan. The committee will publish a report on 4 May calling for greater efforts to sustain university chemistry departments. Smith, a professor of economics, told the committee at a hearing on 27 March that he did not accept that \u201ca serious science university must have a chemistry department\u201d. \u201cI absolutely stand by that,\u201d he told  Nature  last week, insisting that universities must evolve with student demand. But opponents of the closure claim that the department has been allowed to go to seed, with no effort made to retain or replace lost staff. So the campaigning continues, with chemistry students at the university staging protest meetings and collecting more than 1,000 petition signatures and messages of support. The drive has been boosted by offers from Sussex's life-sciences departments to temporarily forgo making new appointments so that the cash can instead be funnelled into chemistry. Sussex would be the latest in a string of department closures that have left UK chemists increasingly concerned for the future of their field (see  \u2018Recent closures\u2019 ). But with a rating of 5 (the second highest score possible) in the government's latest research assessment exercise, it is the highest-profile case so far. \u201cEvery chemistry department is operating at a deficit,\u201d says Richard Pike, chief executive of the London-based Royal Society of Chemistry. He laments the fact that government funding ignores how expensive chemistry is to teach compared with other subjects. Laboratory space, fume hoods and equipment all send costs soaring, but chemistry departments are given just 1.7 times as much money per student as history or English departments, compared with 4 times as much for medical students. Because the subject underpins so many industries, not least the pharmaceutical business, Pike argues that investing in it is essential for the country's economic future. \u201cClosing chemistry departments is ultimately suicide for the country,\u201d agrees Keith Smith, head of chemistry at the University of Wales Swansea, which will teach its last group of undergraduates next year. Fresh crops of graduates are clearly essential to maintaining chemistry research in Britain, but Smith also points out that small departments such as Swansea's produce a relatively large proportion of chemistry teachers. Without them, he fears that secondary-school students will increasingly be taught by teachers without a chemistry degree, who may lack the enthusiasm to inspire future generations to pursue the subject. It is hard to imagine the same thing happening in the United States, says Catherine Drennan, a chemist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Cambridge. Chemistry departments are considered indispensable by US universities, she says, because the basic science they teach is relevant to so many other disciplines. Every student at MIT learns some chemistry, for example, regardless of their subject area. \u201cChemistry is one of the absolute core sciences,\u201d she says. \u201cYou really need those fundamentals.\u201d Germany experienced a similar chemistry crisis in the 1990s, says Kurt Begitt, director of education for the German Chemical Society. This resulted in several department closures and mergers. But a renewed drive to attract students to the subject has been successful. \u201cDepartments are full,\u201d he says, adding that packed schools are difficult to close. Back in Britain, Lawless says his fund-raising effort has already won interest from two companies, but he is reluctant to name them at such a \u201cdelicate stage of negotiations\u201d. But their offers require Smith's support, and there are yet more hurdles to face in the coming weeks, as Lawless's plan faces a plethora of university committees. If it gets through them all, a final decision on the department's future is due from the university's council on 15 May. Frustratingly for Lawless, Smith says the meetings may merely conclude that more discussion is needed. And if they reject the plan outright, \u201cI've no idea what we'll do\u201d, sighs Lawless. \u201cI suppose we'll have to look at closing the department.\u201d \n                     News in brief \n                   \n                     News in brief \n                   \n                     Chemistry caught in crisis catalysed by student apathy \n                   \n                     Physical science channel \n                   \n                     Save Chemistry @ Sussex campaign \n                   \n                     Royal Society of Chemistry \n                   \n                     UK Parliamentary Science and Technology Committee evidence \n                   \n                     Sir Harry Kroto's video message \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Climate experts have expressed surprise and concern about a US government decision to release a politically sensitive report when it is still in draft form. Access to the first section of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fourth Assessment Report, due for publication in 2007, has been open for around a month. IPCC reports are designed to inform political negotiations on climate change, and key statements in the assessments can influence debate for years after publication. The first section, called Working Group I (WGI), offers an overview of the science of climate change and predictions about the possible course of global warming. The US government says its move will allow the broadest range of experts to comment, and will avoid accusations that any groups have been denied access. But the decision effectively to publish the report worries some researchers, who say it could undermine what has previously been a confidential review process. \u201cIf the US government is going to allow lobby groups, or persons associated with them, input into the government review, there is a serious chance that the whole thing could get hijacked,\u201d says one US government scientist involved in the process. The WGI chapters of the assessment have completed one round of scientific review and are now with national governments. Most countries have solicited comments from a small number of experts, but the US Climate Change Science Program, which coordinates US climate research efforts on behalf of the government, posted the draft online on 7 April, together with a notification in the  Federal Register . The climate science programme also sent out an e-mail to \u201cthousands\u201d of scientists, environmental groups and industry lobbyists, inviting them to comment. The website and report itself note that the contents should not be distributed or quoted, despite the fact that they can be accessed by asking for a password, which is provided automatically. \u201cI was quite surprised,\u201d says a senior IPCC scientist, who spoke on condition of anonymity. \u201cI never thought they would do something like this.\u201d Rajendra Pachauri, the panel's chairman, did not learn of the decision until after the report was posted online. He says that it is not in keeping with past practice, but adds that he could not interfere with how governments choose to collect comments. Lead authors on the WGI report declined to comment. Roger Pielke Jr, a climate-policy expert at the University of Colorado, Boulder, suggests that the move could be seen as a deliberate strategy to defuse the newsworthiness of the final report. \u201cIf the report is already out there in circulation, then the \u2018news\u2019 value is likely to be much diminished when the official report is finally released,\u201d he says. The current US administration has been critical of the workings of the IPCC and its conclusions. \n               Up for debate \n             But Pielke adds that this isn't the only interpretation: \u201cLess cynically, I do think that scientific assessments should be done much more in a continuous mode than the discrete approach favoured by the IPCC. So if this is a step in that direction, there could be some value.\u201d Other climate experts contacted by  Nature  also welcomed the open approach, while questioning the motivation. Governments have until 2 June to send comments to the IPCC. Those familiar with the process say that the chapters are unlikely to change substantially, but that the technical and policy-maker summaries will attract many comments. The current draft, which represents the message that the scientific authors want to present to policy-makers, contains few statements that will surprise climate researchers, but its tone is much more confident than that of its predecessor, published in 2001. And that, say researchers, will make it harder for sceptical politicians and lobbyists to attack climate predictions. \u201cPeople won't be punching holes in the science,\u201d says Jay Gulledge, a senior research fellow at the Pew Center on Global Climate Change in Arlington, Virginia. Emily Shuckburgh, a climate researcher at the University of Cambridge, UK, agrees: \u201cIf you're a sceptic, it's difficult to see where to attack on the modelling side.\u201d One critical number in previous reports has been the sensitivity of the climate to increases in greenhouse-gas levels. In 2001, scientists estimated that a doubling of carbon dioxide levels would cause an increase of 1.5\u20134.5 \u00b0C, but acknowledged that this range was little more than a best guess. The draft 2007 WGI report describes how new models and data sets allow the range to be properly quantified. It estimates the effect of doubling carbon dioxide as a rise of 2.0\u20134.5 \u00b0C and, for the first time, suggests a single most likely figure: 3 \u00b0C. This estimate is already widely accepted by climate scientists. \n               Commitment to change \n             Another set of predictions that have become much more robust are those about \u2018commitment\u2019 \u2014 the ongoing climatic changes that would be expected even if greenhouse-gas levels could be stabilized. The existence of commitment was acknowledged in the last WGI report, but no number was given in the policy-makers' summary. In contrast, the 2007 summary stresses that even if greenhouse gases level off now, warming will continue at about the current rate for several decades. The error bars have also shrunk substantially on one of the biggest uncertainties in 2001 \u2014 the role of aerosols such as soot from fires, which exert a cooling effect by reflecting sunlight. In addition, certainty over politically important statements about whether climate change has already been observed has increased. Data on twentieth-century changes in precipitation and sea-level rise are now more precise, and the risk of ocean acidification is detailed for the first time. Such assertions are likely to be seized on by environmental groups if they appear in the final document. Reports of Working Groups II and III, which cover the consequences of climate change and the attempts to tackle it, are due later in 2007. An overall policy-makers' summary covering all three components will then be produced. In previous years this has been negotiated line by line by politicians, some of whom have been accused of seeking to downplay certain findings to protect national interests, such as the petroleum industry. The 2001 version took four days to finalize. One graph in that summary, known as the \u2018hockey stick\u2019 and used to illustrate temperature change over the past millennium, has caused controversy for years, and is omitted in the current draft of the 2007 WGI policy-makers' summary, although an updated version is in the larger document. This is likely to be seized on by sceptics as evidence that they were right to question the graph's validity; however, there is a similar graph in the current summary, which shows a dramatic twentieth-century rise in the degree to which greenhouse gases trap energy in the atmosphere. If the confident tone of the draft survives, policy experts say it could have quite an impact. Kyoto Protocol negotiations have started to examine what will happen when the current agreement expires in 2012. Similar discussions are being run by the Group of Eight industrialized nations, and by the Asia-Pacific Partnership on Clean Development and Climate, which includes the United States and Australia, neither of which is party to Kyoto. \u201cSeveral negotiation processes are ongoing,\u201d says Michael Grubb, a climate-policy expert at Imperial College, London, who is involved in WGII and WGIII. \u201cThat creates ripe ground for substantial political impact.\u201d Comments on the IPCC report can be submitted until 9 May.

In the run-up to autumn's Senate elections, stem-cell research has become something of a political football. This is raising the profile of bills that could loosen restrictions on federal funding for the research, but some fear that scientific arguments are being overshadowed by politicians' posturing. In November, voters will decide who occupies 33 seats in the Senate and 435 in Congress, and stem cells are poised to play a decisive role in some key races. Last May, the US House of Representatives voted overwhelmingly to loosen restrictions on federal funding of human embryonic stem-cell research. Since then, the Republican Senate majority leader, Bill Frist, has faced demands from stem-cell research advocates to deliver on a promise to bring the issue to the Senate floor (see  Nature   436 , 608; 200510.1038/436608a ). Observers say Frist must factor numerous political considerations into his decision about when and how to bring the issue before the Senate, including how it would be viewed by the White House and how it would affect his own career. The issue has become difficult for the Republican party because although a majority of voters support the work, it is viewed as immoral by the party's conservative core. Washington is buzzing with rumours. Last week, Associated Press reported that senators are deciding whether to vote on a package of three stem-cell bills later this summer. But no senator has confirmed the story, leaving advocates uncertain what this will mean for research. \u201cOnly the details will determine whether it is good or bad for researchers and, ultimately, patients,\u201d says Kevin Wilson, director of public policy at the American Society for Cell Biology. The package would comprise the bill passed by the House and two others, one of which was introduced on 5 May by Pennsylvania senators Arlen Specter and Rick Santorum, both Republicans. Their bill supports research that tries to find sources for human embryonic stem cells that do not harm embryos. The deal might help Santorum, who faces a bruising re-election battle this autumn. But it is unclear how the bill would affect other races. The White House, meanwhile, stands by President George W. Bush's threat to veto any bill that loosens restrictions on federal funding for stem-cell research. Some say such a veto may actually help Bush win some badly needed points. The Christian right is beating him up, says one research advocate, speaking off the record. \u201cThe White House needs to put a stop to that, and this would do it.\u201d Such a scenario would not help researchers much. And some in the research community are nervous about the effect this political manoeuvring could have on science. \u201cThese are complicated, cutting-edge scientific issues, and they need to be considered in a thoughtful and educated manner,\u201d says Wilson. \u201cIn general, this is not the best way to legislate.\u201d \n                     Senator boosts chances of stem-cell reform \n                   \n                     Special report: Back in the race \n                   \n                     Making stem cells web focus \n                   \n                     Riches in stem cell niches web focus \n                   \n                     Stem cells in focus \n                   \n                     US Senate \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

More than 125 planetary scientists will gather in Pasadena, California, next week to begin planning NASA's next steps on Mars \u2014 or rather, where that step should fall. The workshop will rank more than 40 candidate landing sites for the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL), a rover slated to depart for the planet in September 2009. There will be no hasty decisions: NASA plans three more workshops after this one, and will choose the final site a month before launch. NASA says the MSL will improve in every way on the Spirit and Opportunity rovers now exploring Mars. Its ten instruments weigh a total of 75 kg, compared with five instruments weighing 9 kg on the current rovers. It will be able to land within a 20-km-diameter target circle, anywhere within 60\u00b0 north or south of the martian equator, instead of being restricted to a narrow band around the planet's middle. And it will be able to negotiate rougher and steeper terrain than Spirit and Opportunity and travel further \u2014 at least 20 kilometres. With so many options for where to land, workshop co-chairman John Grant of the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum's Center for Earth and Planetary Studies feared scientists would suggest thousands of candidate sites. \u201cWe were quite relieved to find out that the number of sites is manageable,\u201d he says. The first workshop's goal is to rank the sites as high, medium or low priority for detailed study using cameras and other instruments orbiting Mars. The MSL will continue the work of its predecessors in tracing the history of water on Mars. Geologists would prefer to explore an area where many layers of rock are exposed, to give a large cross-section through time. The less dust covering the rocks, the better. The site must also be navigable for a wheeled rover, without too many obstacles. And particularly prized will be areas where scientists believe water once settled in quiet pools that may have provided habitats for ancient martian life. Another improvement on past rover missions is that scientists will know more about the landing sites in advance. Since Spirit and Opportunity arrived on Mars in January 2004, Mars Express and the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) have begun their own study of the surface. The MRO's High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment may be able to spot outcrops from orbit of the kind that Spirit and Opportunity have visited. \n               Candidate landing sites \n             \n               Sedimentary Fans \n             A rover in the Eberswalde crater could roam (black line) among fan-shaped sedimentary deposits at the end of flow channels, pausing at rock exposures.

Rex Dalton reports. The human family tree may now be a lot cleaner, according to the discoverers of a cache of fossils on a hillside in Ethiopia. The researchers say the fossils, from the Afar region, go a long way towards showing that early hominids were not a diverse group of coexisting species. The team suggests three species evolved as a single lineage between at least 4.4 million years ago and 2.9 million years ago \u2014 an era when humankind refined its ability to walk upright while developing new ways to live (see timeline below). The idea is one of the most contentious in palaeoanthropology. The fossil trove, reported earlier this month (T. D. White  et al .  Nature   440 , 883\u2013889; 2006) has confirmed some important aspects of the trail towards the genus  Homo , which appeared around 2.3 million years ago. But experts are still bickering over the relationship between the species that have been found. The latest report describes 30 fossils, belonging to at least eight individuals of  Australopithecus anamensis ; before the discovery, the only known specimens of this species came from northern Kenya, about 1,000 kilometres to the southwest (M. G. Leakey  et al .  Nature   376 , 565\u2013571; 1995). The Afar specimens date to 4.1 million years ago, and were dug from ravines cut by rain at a site called Asa Issie, meaning red hill. They are the latest discovery made by the Middle Awash project, an international team that has explored these geological formations for nearly 25 winters. An hour's walk to the northeast of Asa Issie is the Aramis site, where the team found fossils of an earlier species called  Ardipithecus ramidus , dated to 4.4 million years ago. An hour's walk to the east lie fossils of  Australopithecus afarensis  \u2014 the species to which Lucy belongs, dated to 3.4 million years ago. Many consider  A. afarensis  to be the immediate predecessor of the genus  Homo . It was first identified at Hadar, about 70 kilometres north of Asa Issie, and lived until at least 2.9 million years ago in eastern Africa. \n               Theory of relativity \n             An understanding of our own species' lineage is crucial to building a picture of how early hominids evolved, their gait, diet and tools, and the effects of the environment. Experts have squabbled over the relationship between  Ar. ramidus ,  Au. anamensis  and  Au. afarensis  ever since they were discovered: some believe each species evolved directly into the next, and others insist that they lie on separate branches of the family tree. The latest Afar discovery is exciting experts because it shows that the three hominids existing in the same area, but in successive time periods. Tim White of the University of California, Berkeley, co-leader of the Awash team, believes this points to a direct lineage between the three \u2014 a process called phyletic evolution. The new  Au. anamensis  fossils are only 300,000 years younger than  Ar. ramidus , meaning that if one became the other, the changes would have had to happen that fast. But the key point, says White, is that fossils of  Au. anamensis  and  Au. afarensis  have never been found in sediments the same age as those containing  Ar. ramidus . If fossils of the different species were found together, that could show that they belonged to multiple lineages existing simultaneously. Finding remains of all three species in the same area but not from the same time period suggests they did not coexist, says White. The team confirmed the dates using several geological dating methods on layers of rock above and below the fossils, along with examinations of other animal fossils found, including antelopes, monkeys and pigs. The specimens also provide anatomical clues to evolutionary history. \u201cThe new  Au. anamensis  fossils are anatomically intermediate between the earlier  Ar. ramidus  and the later  Au. afarensis ,\u201d says White. For example, the teeth of the newly discovered  Au. anamensis  fossils seem adapted to chew tougher and more abrasive foods than  Ar. ramidus . The researchers believe this shows that  Au. anamensis  had a broader diet. \u201cAll this strengthens the view that there is phyletic evolution from  Ar. ramidus  through  Au. anamensis ,\u201d says White. He believes he has nailed down the relationship between the two later species, although he says that further specimens are needed to prove the earlier link. This month's  Nature  paper makes a bold argument, and shows the Awash team seeking to put its mark on the record. Others in the field are impressed. \u201cWhen you find 30 new hominid fossils, you are allowed a certain amount of conjecture,\u201d says Bernard Wood, a palaeoanthropologist at George Washington University in Washington DC. \u201cAs always, they have done a fantastic job.\u201d But he and others are unconvinced by the Awash team's conclusion: \u201cThis is only the first half of the rugby match,\u201d says Wood. Meave Leakey, lead author on the  Au. anamensis  discoveries in Kenya, is more blunt. \u201cI don't believe this,\u201d she says. \u201cWe do not have the specimens to fill the gaps.\u201d \n               Ancestral pile-up \n             Leakey and Wood are among those who believe that other, as yet undiscovered hominid species may have lived at this time, from 4.4 million to 2.9 million years ago. The existence of other species would cloud or eliminate the argument for a direct lineage. \u201cMy prejudice is there are more lineages rather than fewer \u2014 more diversity,\u201d says Wood. \u201cI have to concede these new data are dramatic. But we should beware coming out with a complete explanation when we don't have all the evidence.\u201d This argument frustrates White. \u201cThere were Martians there back then too,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd spacecraft all over the Pliocene \u2014 we just haven't found them yet.\u201d Similar arguments run for various phases of hominid evolution, for example whether  Homo ergaster  evolved into  H. erectus , or whether they were two coexisting lineages \u2014 White advocates the former. But ultimately, the argument comes down to the point that more fossils could always be found, so it is unclear that the two sides will ever agree. In the meantime, the new  Au. anamensis  fossils are at the Ethiopian National Museum in Addis Adaba, where they will augment the Middle Awash hominid collection, which spans nearly 6 million years. \u201cThe discovery at Asa Issie is really wonderful,\u201d says Mamitu Yilma, the museum's director. \u201cThis strengthens the museum as an ideal centre to study human evolution.\u201d \n                     Ethiopia: Awash with fossils \n                   \n                     Asa Issie, Aramis and the origin of Australopithecus \n                   \n                     New four-million-year-old hominid species from Kanapoi and Allia Bay, Kenya \n                   \n                     Australopithecus ramidus, a new species of early hominid from Aramis, Ethiopia \n                   \n                     New discoveries of Australopithecus at Maka in Ethiopia \n                   \n                     Plio\u2014Pleistocene hominid discoveries in Hadar, Ethiopia \n                   \n                     Revealing Human Origins Initiative \n                   \n                     Modern human origins: progress and prospects \n                   \n                     Institute of Human Origins: Lucy FAQ \n                   \n                     Bernard Wood website \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

The United States must make a bid to host the International Linear Collider (ILC), according to a report out this week from the National Academy of Sciences. If the multi-billion-dollar particle accelerator is not built on US soil, the nation's high-energy physics community may be doomed. High-energy physicists globally have endorsed the ILC as the next big project for the field. The collider, 30 kilometres in length, would smash together electrons and their anti-particles, known as positrons, at 500 GeV in the hope of probing fundamental particles, including the yet-to-be-discovered Higgs particle. \u201cWithout a serious bid, the community is going to atrophy,\u201d warns Harold Shapiro, an economist from Princeton University who chaired the panel that produced the report; the panel was convened by the US Department of Energy and the National Science Foundation, which together fund the lion's share of high-energy physics research in the United States. In addition to recommending that the government make a strong bid for the project, the panel suggests that it invests in high-energy astrophysics and neutrino research. There are currently around 2,000 high-energy physicists working in the United States. The report comes at a precarious time for high-energy physics in America. Earlier this year, budget cutbacks forced the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider to take a private donation to continue operations, and the Tevatron, the nation's premier accelerator at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, or Fermilab, in Batavia, Illinois, is expected to shut down within three to four years (see  Nature   435 , 728\u2013729; 2005). \u201cThere doesn't seem to be a next step in place,\u201d Shapiro says. \u201cThis is a moment where important decisions have to be made.\u201d Although the report will strengthen scientists' case for the project, Mike Lubell, head of public affairs for the American Physical Society in Washington DC, cautions that the collider \u2014 estimated to cost at least $6 billion \u2014 still faces an uphill battle. \u201cIn an era where the government is not keen on raising taxes or cutting defence funding, a big project like this is going to run into a lot of problems,\u201d he says. \u201cI think this report will be very welcome in Europe,\u201d says Brian Foster, a physicist at the University of Oxford, UK, who is heading the European design effort for the collider. Foster says that the Large Hadron Collider, a $2.5-billion accelerator being built at CERN, the European particle-physics laboratory in Geneva, Switzerland, is consuming most of the continent's resources. A strong US bid for the ILC, he says, will strengthen the prospects of the collider, although he adds that Russia, Japan and China have all expressed interest in hosting it. \n                     News in brief \n                   \n                     Fermilab: High-risk physics \n                   \n                     Superconductor beats copper in plans for particle collider \n                   \n                     The National Academies \n                   \n                     The International Linear Collider \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

The threat of a bird-flu pandemic is forcing vaccine developers to make tough choices about the types of vaccine to pursue. Many advanced trials are testing vaccines that use disrupted viruses, which have few side effects. But some experts now argue that, with such a wide gap between how much vaccine would be needed in a pandemic and how much the world's manufacturers could produce, attention should focus on vaccines that use the intact virus. Although thought to be riskier, they are far more effective at lower doses. The likely shortfall in the available vaccine is highlighted this week by a study modelling the effectiveness of various interventions for mitigating a bird-flu pandemic. Using Britain and the United States as examples, Neil Ferguson at Imperial College London and his co-authors found that, to curb the spread of the disease, vaccinations would need to begin within one to two months of the pandemic starting (N. M. Ferguson  et al .  Nature  doi:10.1038/nature04795; 2006). And a stockpile of vaccine for 20% of the population would greatly reduce the number of cases, even if it wasn't a perfect match for the pandemic strain. \u201cThere is a significant gap between the desirable and actual access to the vaccine,\u201d says Klaus St\u00f6hr, an adviser on flu-pandemic vaccine development at the World Health Organization. \u201cThere need to be fundamental changes in the way we produce and use influenza vaccines.\u201d More than a dozen groups are developing pandemic vaccines, testing a range of strategies to boost potency and production capacity (see  map ). Some companies are testing more potent vaccine \u2018adjuvants\u2019, which are used with a vaccine to boost the immune response. Others are developing cell-based systems to grow the virus, rather than the chicken eggs currently used, to increase vaccine yields. But some experts argue that a quicker path to a greater vaccine supply is to switch to using whole (but inactivated) virus, rather than the \u2018split\u2019 virus conventionally used. The intact virus triggers a more powerful immune response, and such vaccines would potentially increase stocks, because a lower dose could be used. \u201cCompanies should be using the whole virus, because there would be more to go round,\u201d says Graeme Laver, a virologist who has worked on flu for more than 40 years, primarily at the Australian National University in Canberra. The risk is that such vaccines could trigger toxic reactions \u2014 whole-virus flu vaccines used in the 1960s sometimes caused problems such as fever and pain, especially in children. So companies switched to split viruses, in which the viral coat is disrupted with a detergent. But David Fedson, former medical director of Paris-based Sanofi-Aventis, believes the threat of bird flu makes whole-virus vaccines an attractive option again. \u201cWhen death is the other option, a sore arm is not a bad price to pay,\u201d he says. Several companies are in the early stages of developing whole-virus vaccines (see map). But many vaccine makers, including Sanofi Pasteur, the vaccine arm of Sanofi-Aventis, say they won't be switching to whole virus in the near future, mainly because their facilities are geared to making split-virus vaccines. \u201cIf a pandemic was declared this year, we would go with what we already have up our sleeve,\u201d says Rachel David, a spokeswoman for Melbourne-based CSL, which has a split-virus vaccine in clinical trials. But St\u00f6hr cautions against being too obsessed with the whole-versus-split virus issue. \u201cThere are many avenues for improving the vaccines,\u201d he points out. He says a global action plan is urgently needed to prioritize research efforts and rally more funding to develop flu-pandemic vaccines. \n                     Race is on for flu vaccine \n                   \n                     Bird flu vaccine not up to scratch \n                   \n                     Avian flu special: Is this our best shot? \n                   \n                     Nature's avian flu mashup \n                   \n                     Bird Flu in focus \n                   \n                     Avian Flu web focus \n                   \n                     IFPMA summary of flu-vaccine manufacturers \n                   \n                     WHO avian influenza information \n                   \n                     Google Earth \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

The World Bank has been forced to rebut a series of stinging criticisms from public-health commentators. They have accused it of failing to fulfil its promise to provide funds and leadership for Africa's fight against malaria. Last year, the World Bank made a fresh pledge to implement global antimalaria schemes worth up to US$1 billion over the next five years. This week's accusations mark the latest chapter in an acrimonious battle between the bank and a group of advocates who think it should hand the pledged funds over to agencies that, they argue, have greater public-health expertise. The bank pledged in 2000 to make between $US300 million and $500 million available to African governments for antimalaria treatments and infrastructure. But the bank's critics point out that by 2005, no more than $150 million had been provided. \u201cIn 2000, they made the largest ever promise to spend money on malaria in Africa,\u201d says Amir Attaran, a law professor at the University of Ottawa, Canada, and lead author of a commentary that sets out the criticisms in this week's issue of  The Lancet  (A. Attaran  et al .  Lancet  doi:10.1016/S0140-6736(06)68545-0; 2006). \u201cIt's now 2006, and they have broken that promise.\u201d The commentary is co-authored by 12 epidemiology and public-health experts, from Africa, Europe and North America. Bank officials admit that their initial drive was unsuccessful, partly because they did not receive as many applications from African governments as they expected. But they point out that the 2005 pledge, which aims to help the global Roll Back Malaria initiative hit its 2010 target of halving malaria cases, is already making progress. \u201cThese criticisms are a year out of date,\u201d Suprotik Basu, a member of the bank's malaria team, told  Nature . He says that, since the effort was relaunched last year, projects worth a total of $190 million have been approved in Eritrea, Niger, Zambia and the Democratic Republic of Congo, and that the total will stand at $400 million by July next year. The bank will provide roughly half of the money itself. It will broker deals with other banks and with non-government organizations such as the Seattle-based Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to raise the remainder of the cash. But Attaran complains that the bank, which has an annual tax-funded budget of $20 billion, initially promised to raise all the funds by itself. \n               Charges levelled \n             More seriously, Attaran and his colleagues accuse the bank of massaging figures from previous malaria projects in Brazil and India to make them seem more successful. They also charge it with endorsing treatment options in India that will leave millions exposed to resistant forms of the disease. Basu describes the allegations as \u201cflat wrong\u201d. Data used to compile the bank's figures, given to Attaran upon request, came from peer-reviewed studies, and were neither collected nor doctored by the bank. And Basu insists that the bank is working closely with the World Health Organization (WHO) to ensure that the treatments it funds are recommended ones. Whereas most malaria in Africa is spread by the  Plasmodium falciparum  parasite and ideally treated using drugs called artemisinins, around half of India's cases are caused by  P. vivax , and can be treated using the much cheaper drug chloroquine. Resistance to chloroquine is rife among  P. falciparum , but Attaran says that, in areas of India where both forms are prevalent, patients are treated with the drug anyway, with partial success. Basu insists that this is in accordance with WHO recommendations. But Attaran and his co-authors retort that the bank should stop trying to lead global efforts against malaria and instead turn its funds over to dedicated health agencies such as the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. \u201cIf you woke up with a fever, you wouldn't ring your bank for help,\u201d Attaran says. \u201cThe World Bank is great at being a bank, but bad at being the world's doctor.\u201d In 2004, Attaran criticized the US Agency for International Development over the handling of its $90-million malaria budget (see  Nature   435 , 257; 200510.1038/435257b ), and he has argued angrily with World Bank officials in the past. A bank spokesman accuses Attaran of \u201cwaging war against the bank\u201d, The spokesman claims that Attaran refused a 2002 invitation to discuss the issue with bank officials. \n                     Malaria breakthrough raises spectre of drug resistance \n                   \n                     Zambia to wage 'scientific' war on malaria \n                   \n                     US aid agency grilled over malaria funds \n                   \n                     Malaria map paints stark picture \n                   \n                     Nature Outlook: Where did it all go wrong? \n                   \n                     Malaria special \n                   \n                     Malaria web focus \n                   \n                     Nature Medicine focus on malaria \n                   \n                     Health medicine news \n                   \n                     \n                         The Lancet \n                       \n                   \n                     World Bank \n                   \n                     Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria \n                   \n                     World Health Organization malaria factsheet \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

The world's most critically endangered cetacean, the Chinese \u2018baiji\u2019 river dolphin, may finally have a chance of being saved from extinction. But it could be too late; researchers who carried out a nine-day pilot search for the dolphins last month didn't find a single one. The freshwater baiji ( Lipotes vexillifer ) once thrived in their only habitat, the Yangtze River, which runs though central China. But fewer than 100 dolphins are thought to be left in the river, which has become a busy, polluted highway. \u201cIf the giant panda is China's symbol of the destruction of forests, the baiji stands for polluted waters,\u201d says Wang Ding, from the Wuhan Institute of Hydrobiology. An international team of scientists, led by Ding, is hoping to catch the animals and release them in a safer place, possibly the Shishou reserve, which is a 20-kilometre arm off the Yangtze. But first the researchers \u2014from China, the United States, Britain and Switzerland \u2014 need to find out exactly how many of the dolphins remain and where they are. They are preparing to conduct a search of 1,700 kilometres of the river in November, but carried out a pilot survey in March to refine their techniques. The baiji are so few and far between that the best way to spot them is with acoustic devices. But that's a challenge. \u201cThe river is so noisy you can't use traditional acoustic equipment,\u201d explains Jay Barlow, a marine mammalogist from the US National Marine Fisheries Service in La Jolla, California, who was on last month's cruise. He and his colleagues are working on a method to clean up recordings from hydrophones, to isolate the baiji's distinctive whistles. The researchers were disappointed not to see a single baiji on their recent search, but their hopes are now focused on the full-scale survey in November. \u201cIf none are found then, the burden of proof will change,\u201d says Barlow. \u201cThe species will be considered extinct unless proven otherwise.\u201d \n                     Net losses pose extinction risk for porpoise \n                   \n                     Ecologists seek to turn tide on Colorado River \n                   \n                     Baiji.org \n                   \n                     Dolphin Ring: river dolphins \n                   \n                     Dolphin Research Centre \n                   \n                     Understanding the baiji dolphin \n                   \n                     Vaquita Marina \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Tokyo Japan's ruling party is poised to revolutionize the country's space programme by allowing it to expand into military applications. In a country constitutionally wedded to peace, the move could cause public uproar. Scientists are also worried that they might lose out. On 28 March, a committee of the Liberal Democratic Party proposed that Japan should revise a 1969 policy limiting the use of space to \u201cpeaceful\u201d objectives. Under the current pacifist constitution, Japan has shied away from developing high-tech military satellites even for defence. The committee suggests that Japan should lift its self-imposed limit on the imaging resolution of military satellites. It plans to submit a bill to the Diet next year to change the way space development is defined, which is likely to pass. \u201cSpace development should be a source of national pride, but Japan doesn't have a diplomatic strategy to take advantage of it,\u201d says Kenichi Kawamura, a spokesman for committee head Takeo Kawamura. The government is concerned about possible attacks from terrorists and from North Korea, which fired ballistic missiles into Japanese water in 1998. Since then, Japan has launched two spy satellites, but their resolution is a quarter of that of other countries' reconnaissance satellites, and Japan has relied on the United States for high-resolution images and communications. The new law would enable Japan's defence agency to have spy satellites with a resolution that could detect a missile launch by another country. The move is being welcomed by Japan's space industry, which hopes that new investment will make satellite manufacturers more competitive internationally. But there are worries abroad. \u201cUS government officials are likely to have great concern about Japan's development of its own military satellites because they are nervous of the spread of understanding of technology,\u201d says Howard McCurdy, a space-policy expert at the American University in Washington DC. Japanese researchers are also worried. They fear that although the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) might enjoy a budget boom in defence-related technologies, smaller-scale science missions could be cut back if government money was funnelled into the space industry. \u201cResearch areas that can be applied to defensive use would be in the spotlight,\u201d says Yasunori Matogawa, JAXA's associate executive director, adding that even areas where Japan has traditionally been strong, such as X-ray astronomy and infrared technologies, may be affected. \u201cThose technologies look close to military ones but they are not the same.\u201d \n                     Space exploration: A shot in the dark? \n                   \n                     Ideas abound as Japan aims to boost its space image \n                   \n                     Liberal Democratic Party of Japan \n                   \n                     Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

The \u2018miracle\u2019 malaria drug artemisinin is a step closer to being produced plentifully and cheaply. Synthetic chemists have put plant genes into yeast to make it churn out large amounts of the precursor artemisinic acid. The discovery brings hope to areas such as sub-Saharan Africa, where those who need the drug most can ill afford it. Researchers have praised the work and are excited that it may soon be possible to get artemisinin to the 300 million to 500 million people infected with malaria each year. But many are also concerned that this will trigger the emergence of resistance to the drug, thus destroying our most effective weapon against the disease. Artemisinin is extracted from the leaves of  Artemisia annua , or sweet wormwood, and has been used for more than 2,000 years by the Chinese as a herbal medicine called  qinghaosu . The parasite that causes malaria has become at least partly resistant to every other treatment tried so far. Artemisinin is still effective, but it is costly and scarce. \u201cThis drug is such an important thing for malaria,\u201d says David Warhurst, an expert in protozoan chemotherapy at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. \u201cIt is the basis of all the new treatments that are going ahead.\u201d Jay Keasling at the University of California, Berkeley, and his colleagues tweaked a pathway and used three plant genes to persuade yeast ( Saccharomyces cerevisiae ) to produce and secrete large amounts of artemisinic acid, which is just a few chemical steps away from artemisinin. The researchers, whose paper starts on  page 940  of this issue, hope that once the process is scaled up it will allow artemisinin to be made industrially. A course of artemisinin currently costs US$2.40; cutting the cost to 10% of that should make it affordable for most sufferers. Work towards industrial production has already been started by the non-profit pharmaceutical company Institute for OneWorld Health, based in San Francisco, California, in partnership with Amyris Biotechnologies and with the help of $42.6 million from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. \u201cWe're focusing on producing a known pharmaceutical so that it reaches the people who need it most,\u201d says Jack Newman, co-founder of Amyris, based in Emeryville, California. But he is hopeful that the work will lead to industrial production of other plant-based drugs in a similar way. The prospect of plentiful artemisinin is encouraging, but if the parasite becomes resistant, increased drug production will be worthless. \u201cThe loss of artemisinin could spell disaster for malaria sufferers,\u201d warns Chris Hentschel, head of the non-profit Medicines for Malaria Venture, based in Geneva. There is no consensus on how likely resistance is, but some think the risk is high. Artemisinin works by disabling a calcium pump in the malaria parasite, and last year researchers reported that the mutation of a single amino acid was sufficient to confer resistance (A.-C. Uhleman  et al .  Nature Struct. Mol. Biol.   12,  628\u2013629; 2005). When another team gave low doses of artemisinin to parasites taken from patients in French Guiana, some mutated, becoming highly resistant to the drug (R. Jambou  et al .  Lancet   366,  1960\u20131963; 2005). The main way to stop resistance arising is to always give the drug in combination with others. In January, the World Health Organization (WHO) made a plea to pharmaceutical companies to end the marketing and sale of single-drug artemisinin medicines. But as other malaria drugs grow increasingly ineffective, many feel that resistance to artemisinin is inevitable. \u201cWe hope it won't happen,\u201d says Warhurst. \u201cBut looking for new drugs is important.\u201d \n                     Halt called on single-drug antimalarial prescriptions \n                   \n                     A single amino acid residue can determine the sensitivity of SERCAs to artemisinins \n                   \n                     An attack on all fronts \n                   \n                     Identification of an antimalarial synthetic trioxolane drug development candidate \n                   \n                     Engineering a mevalonate pathway in Escherichia coli for production of terpenoids \n                   \n                     Malaria Outlook \n                   \n                     News@nature.com Malaria Special \n                   \n                     Institute for OneWorld Health \n                   \n                     Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation \n                   \n                     WHO pages on malaria \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},
{"file_id": "440855a", "url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/440855a", "year": 2006, "authors": [], "parsed_as_year": "2006_or_before", "body": "As it becomes clear that the London clinical trial disaster was indeed the fault of the drug itself, Michael Hopkin looks at what went wrong, and whether there is any future for \u2018superagonist\u2019 antibody therapies. There was no warning from animal tests, but last month the experimental antibody drug TGN1412 put six British men in intensive care. The resulting investigation ruled out any failure of experimental and regulatory procedures \u2014 a relief for those involved, but a damaging blow for the field. Immunologists are now left asking what went so badly wrong in the trial, and whether the fearsome potency of \u2018superagonist\u2019 antibody therapies will outweigh their promise. The six volunteers at London's Northwick Park Hospital were probably struck by a huge immune reaction called a cytokine storm \u2014 a flood of inflammatory molecules released by cells called helper T cells, which shut down their organs in hours. The UK Medical and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, which approved the trial, announced last week that it has found no evidence of contamination in the treatments, which means the devastating effects were almost certainly caused by TGN1412 itself. With hindsight, it might be no surprise that the compound, dubbed a \u2018superagonist\u2019 antibody by its creators, could run amok in the immune system. Around 20 antibody therapies are currently approved or nearing approval, most of which mimic natural human antibodies against specific viruses or cancer-cell types. But TGN1412 is different. It was designed to circumvent the usual checks and balances that prevent T cells from overreacting in the course of their normal duties. Usually, T cells respond to specific enemies, or antigens, recognized by the immune system. After the antigen is first encountered, an \u2018antigen-presenting cell\u2019 binds to a T cell at two sites on its surface: the T-cell receptor (TCR) and the CD28 receptor. TCR binding is specific to the antigen in question, whereas CD28 binding acts more like a \u2018go\u2019 switch for the T cell; both are normally required (see graphic, below). But the makers of TGN1412 found a way to switch on the CD28 green light without TCR binding, activating T cells across the board. T cells fall into three broad categories: killers, which destroy specific target cells; helpers, which boost other parts of the immune system and are the most likely source of a cytokine storm; and regulatory T cells, which suppress other elements of the immune system. Roughly half of killer T cells, and virtually all helper and regulatory T cells, express the CD28 receptor. When Thomas H\u00fcnig, an immunologist at the University of W\u00fcrzburg and researchers at TeGenero, the spin-off company he co-founded to develop TGN1412, began testing the antibody on animals, they found that the drug seemed only to activate regulatory T cells (Beyersdorf, N.  et al .  J. Exp. Med.   202,  445\u2013455; 2005). This made it an enticing candidate for treating autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and type-1 diabetes. The researchers hoped that TGN1412 could make immunosuppressive cells soothe sites of overinflammation, while the rest of the immune system carried on as usual. It is still not clear why, when TGN1412 affected only regulatory T cells in animals, the same almost certainly did not occur in the human trial. It is likely that in humans the super-antibody activated helper T cells en masse, triggering a cytokine storm. \u201cWe were shocked and surprised to see what happened in humans,\u201d H\u00fcnig told  Nature . In preclinical trials, monkeys got a dose 500 times that given to the human volunteers, and the monkey CD28 receptor is identical to the human one, says H\u00fcnig. This means that the effects in the monkey trial should have been comparable. One possible source of the difference between the animal and human trials is that the \u2018tail\u2019 of the antibody molecule at the opposite end from the CD28-binding site may not be the same in humans and monkeys. Antibody tails can undergo a process called crosslinking, which amplifies an immune response by recruiting more immune cells or antibodies. Therapeutic antibodies are modified so that they have the same overall structure as a generic human antibody, but doing this may also have prevented the full extent of TGN1412's activity from showing up in animal tests. H\u00fcnig admits that this could have happened. H\u00fcnig's team should have known of previous research on this region, says Camilo Colaco of ImmunoBiology, an immunological research company in Cambridge, UK. Similar work has been done on CD3 receptors, which are crucial for the TCR component of T-cell activation, he says. Researchers were hoping that a superagonist antibody directed at this receptor could boost general T-cell activity, helping transplant patients restore their immune systems after taking immunosuppressive drugs. \n               Indiscriminate killers \n             But in tests of the antibody in mice, researchers found that uncontrolled cytokine release was a problem \u2014 albeit not a large one because the mice were already immunodepleted (L. Chatenoud  et al .  Transplantation   49,  697\u2013702; 1990). Tweaks to the antibody's tail to prevent crosslinking resulted in an antibody that did not have the same problem and could enter clinical trials (P. A. Carpenter  et al .  Biol. Blood Marrow Transplant.   11,  465\u2013471; 2005); the drug has now been approved under the name visilizumab. But using unmodified superagonists in a healthy volunteer with an intact immune system is playing with fire, says Colaco: \u201cIt would go bananas.\u201d Another, more controversial, theory is that, in humans, CD28 receptors are found in the immune system beyond just T cells. Dorothy Lewis, an immunologist at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, Texas, says that the receptor may be present on granulocytes, the most numerous white blood cells in the body, which have a range of cell-killing tricks. Alternatively, killer T cells might have been triggered to release a cell-destroying molecule called granzyme B. These processes could theoretically produce the effect seen in the TGN1412 trial, says Lewis. She also suggests that a cytokine storm might come on too slowly to account for the reaction seen in the trial volunteers, all of whom suffered severe effects within minutes and collapsed within 12 hours of being injected with TGN1412. \u201cWhen you trigger T cells it takes a while to get up to speed,\u201d she says. \u201cBut granulocytes are good to go.\u201d H\u00fcnig doesn't buy her theory, however. After the trial went wrong, he says he went over the literature to see if CD28 receptors might be more common than he had imagined. He says that only one group has ever claimed to have spotted them on granulocytes (K. Venuprasad  et al .  Eur. J. Immunol.   31,  1536\u20131543; 2001), and he is confident that the idea can be ruled out. H\u00fcnig remains convinced that overactivation of helper T cells was to blame: \u201cIt was not too fast to be cytokines.\u201d \n               Proceed with caution \n             Some, such as Steve Anderton, an immunologist at the University of Edinburgh, UK, who is studying the use of antibodies to overcome cancers that evade the immune system, are concerned at the haste with which TGN1412 was tried out in humans \u2014 barely a year after the structure of the CD28 receptor was deduced (E. J. Evans  et al .  Nature Immunol.   6 , 271\u2013279; 2005). \u201cIt is flabbergasting that this approach was tried,\u201d he says. \u201cIt takes away all the rules of the immune response.\u201d Jim Riley of the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, who works on the CD28 pathway, feels similarly. \u201cMy first reaction was \u2018how did they get that through the regulatory body?\u2019\u201d he says. A major question now is how the field can move forward. Instead of risking further work with superantibodies, some favour turning to other approaches. One option is to culture a patient's regulatory T cells in the lab, then inject them into the bloodstream. Another is to target processes such as the binding of antigen-presenting cells to T cells using blocking antibodies. This method allows autoimmune disease to be treated without activating regulatory T cells, and has already been tested on a mouse model of multiple sclerosis (H. D. Lum  et al .  Leukocyte Biol. ; in the press). But others feel that superantibody therapy does have a future. The CD3 superantibody visilizumab suggests that such drugs can be safe. And Anderton says that the CD25 receptor, which is expressed mainly by regulatory T cells, and by other T cells only once they are activated, may be a safer target than CD28. TeGenero's future is unclear \u2014 it has a staff of just 15 people, and TGN1412 was its only product. The company seems hopeful that the technology can be tamed: \u201cIt is too early to give definitive answers on how superagonistic antibodies must be developed in the future,\u201d TeGenero said in a statement to  Nature . \u201cDangers can possibly be reduced by very careful assessment of pharmacological as well as safety characteristics.\u201d But the idea of using superantibodies to activate the CD28 receptor is almost certainly dead. \u201cIn its current form I wouldn't want to have anything to do with it,\u201d says Riley.

Can people catch the H5N1 avian flu virus from eating infected poultry? Colin Blakemore, chief executive of the UK Medical Research Council, says the public need not worry. \u201cThere is no evidence of transmission to people by eating cooked eggs or chicken,\u201d he said on BBC radio last week, adding that the only food risk he could see was from \u201cdrinking swans' blood\u201d. Blakemore's sound bite came a day after Britain's first case of H5N1 in a wild bird was confirmed \u2014 a dead swan found floating in a harbour in Cellardyke, Scotland. And it echoes a slew of recent reassurances by governments worldwide and by the World Health Organization (WHO), all conscious of damaging public confidence and the poultry industry. But many flu scientists are concerned that, although the risks are low compared with those associated with contact with diseased birds, there is not enough evidence to say that the virus cannot be transmitted by eating infected poultry. \u201cOral transmission is an open question,\u201d says Masato Tashiro, a virologist at the National Institute of Infectious Diseases in Tokyo. \u201cDirect evidence of oral infection is lacking, but so too is proof against.\u201d On 23 March, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) published a prominent scientific risk assessment ( EFSA J.   74,  1\u201329; 2006). Its advice is that poultry products are safe to eat and have \u201cnot been implicated in the transmission of the H5N1 avian influenza virus to humans\u201d. H5N1 is present in the meat and eggs of infected birds, and animals have become infected by eating diseased birds. But the EFSA plays down this route in humans, arguing that \u201chumans who have acquired the infection have been in direct contact with infected live or dead birds\u201d. That overstates the case, says Jody Lanard, a physician and risk-communication consultant based in Princeton, New Jersey, who has recently advised the WHO about pandemic communication. She points out that the report itself acknowledges elsewhere that in many instances there is not enough epidemiological evidence to identify the source of infection, and that poor preparation and cooking of food cannot be excluded as the cause. \u201cSuch cases could equally well indicate a likely gastro\u2013intestinal portal of entry,\u201d agrees Menno de Jong, a virologist at the Hospital for Tropical Diseases in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. The report also dismisses the idea that H5N1 can enter the body via the human gut, concluding that there is \u201cno proof that virus replicates in the human intestine\u201d. Although it mentions the presence of diarrhoea in infected humans, together with the detection of viral RNA in intestines and the virus in rectal swabs, it says these \u201cdo not allow one to conclude that the GI tract is a portal of entry or a target organ\u201d. De Jong, who has treated many of the cited diarrhoea cases, says the report's authors are \u201cformally right\u201d to say there is no proof that the virus replicates in the intestine. But there is no proof that it doesn't either, he says, noting that some of the diarrhoea cases had no respiratory symptoms. \u201cAvailable evidence suggests that the gastrointestinal tract in humans is a portal of entry for H5N1,\u201d agrees Albert Osterhaus, a virologist at the Erasmus Medical Center in Rotterdam. He carried out a recent study in which cats became infected with H5N1 after being fed infected chickens (T. Kuiken  et al .  Nature   440 , 741\u2013742; 2006) \u2014 evidence also dismissed by the EFSA report as \u201cunproven\u201d. Of course, to pose a risk the virus must enter the human food chain. The EFSA and other authorities point out that this is unlikely, at least in industrialized countries. But some scientists, including Osterhaus, say it cannot be excluded \u2014 for example, if the virus enters poultry a few days before clinical signs appear. The final argument of the EFSA and the WHO is that even if the virus did enter the food chain, it would be killed by cooking or pasteurization, in the same way as bacterial pathogens such as  Salmonella . But Lanard points to the countless infections with  Salmonella  worldwide, and complains that most risk assessments fail to acknowledge that in reality few people follow guidelines for the safe handling and cooking of poultry. These involve cooking chicken right through to 70 \u00b0C and eggs until they are hard, using separate knives and chopping boards for raw and cooked foods, and hand-washing between operations. An EFSA spokesperson says the agency stands by the report's conclusions. Several scientists are also convinced that avian flu carries no food risks. \u201cAvian influenza has never been and should never have been seen as a food safety issue,\u201d says Les Sims, a consultant for the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). Bird-flu concerns over food, he says, \u201chave a devastating impact on the livelihood of millions of farmers globally and demonstrate that risk communication on this has been a total failure\u201d. But Lanard maintains that to say bird flu is not a food issue is an \u201coverstatement\u201d. She says that such advice shows that little has been learnt about risk communication since the British agriculture minister publicly fed his young daughter a hamburger at the height of the crisis over bovine spongiform encephalitis. A 2005 European Commission poll showed that almost half of European citizens believe authorities favour economic interests over consumer health, she points out. \u201cThese over-reassuring statements discount the future \u2014 they are set up for public distrust,\u201d she says. \u201cAlthough there is no direct evidence that transmission can occur through poorly cooked infected poultry, all animal evidence to date unfortunately suggests that this is possible.\u201d \n                     Can cats spread avian flu? \n                   \n                     Thai dogs carry bird-flu virus, but will they spread it? \n                   \n                     Bird flu's bodily harm revealed \n                   \n                     Avian Flu web focus \n                   \n                     Bird Flu in focus \n                   \n                     European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) report \n                   \n                     WHO avian flu page \n                   \n                     World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) avian flu page \n                   \n                     Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) \n                   \n                     Connotea resources on avain flu \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

The search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) will ramp up in coming months as two dedicated facilities come online \u2014 one to look, the other to listen.  A team led by physicist Paul Horowitz of Harvard University will begin scanning the skies this week for flashes of light from alien civilizations. Most SETI searches have been at radio wavelengths, but theorists surmise that extraterrestrials might also shine laser beacons visible from a few thousand light years away. This will be the first optical SETI project to scan the entire sky, or at least all that can be seen from the Oak Ridge Observatory in Harvard, Massachusetts, where a 180-centimetre telescope has been installed. The $50,000 instrument was paid for by the Planetary Society, a grassroots group of space enthusiasts, and will record flashes briefer than a nanosecond. No known natural process causes such flashes. The all-sky search requires 200 nights of clear viewing, and is expected to take several years. Meanwhile, at the Hat Creek Radio Observatory in northern California, the first ten dishes of the privately funded Allen Telescope Array are due to be demonstrated later this month, says Peter Backus, observing programmes manager at the SETI Institute in Mountain View, California. With money from Microsoft alumni Paul Allen and Nathan Myhrvold, the institute, working with Berkeley, is building an array of 350 six-metre radio dishes dedicated to SETI. The entire array will eavesdrop on nearly a million stars for hints of intelligence. Managers hope to have 42 antennas working by July. The first scan will be of a narrow swathe of the Milky Way's centre. Reprints and Permissions"},

Pressure is mounting on a Beijing neurosurgeon to prove that his popular treatment for spinal-cord injury works. In an article published last month, a group of spinal experts concludes that the treatment, which involves implanting fetal cells into the spine to promote nerve-cell regeneration, has significant side effects and does not provide any benefit. Hongyun Huang's technique is based on the theory that olfactory ensheathing cells (OECs), which normally help to link nerve cells in the nose and the brain, can help regenerate nerve cells at the site of an injury. Since 2001, Huang, who works at Chaoyang Hospital, has treated around 600 patients with tissue from aborted fetuses that he says contain OECs (see  Nature   437 , 810\u2013811; 2005). Three spinal-cord experts have now published a critique of his methods (B. H. Dobkin, A. Curt and J. Guest  Neurorehabil. Neural Repair   20 , 5\u201313; 2006); the researchers followed seven of Huang's patients before and after treatment, reviewed his publications and visited his lab. They say Huang's surgical techniques are good. But despite Huang reporting at a February 2004 meeting that there had been no adverse effects of more than 500 implantations, the researchers found that five of the seven patients experienced side effects including meningitis. They also question whether the cells used by Huang are OECs. \u201cWe don't know what those cells are but they are not pure OECs,\u201d says first author Bruce Dobkin, a neurorehabilitation specialist at the University of California, Los Angeles. The most damning claim in the critique is that none of the patients showed any improvement after treatment. For example co-author Armin Curt, a neurologist at the International Collaboration on Repair Discoveries (ICORD) at the University of British Columbia, Canada, measured muscle responses to nerve signals, and found no change in the three patients he studied before and after the procedure. \u201cThere is a good chance patients are just wasting money and expectations,\u201d says Curt. Huang vigorously defends his technique and calls the report a \u201cpack of lies\u201d, pointing out that the third author, James Guest of the Miami Project to Cure Paralysis, has previously reported observations that support his procedure (J. Guest, L. P. Herrera and T. Qian  Spinal Cord   44,  135\u2013142; 2006). Several patients contacted by  Nature  claim that they have experienced benefits. A nurse practitioner in California says her son showed various improvements, such as reduced sweating, muscle spasm and pain, and a better sense of balance since he had the surgery in November 2004, and accuses Dobkin of focusing on particularly difficult cases. But Dobkin says such testimony can be misleading, because patients are so desperate to believe that they have improved after forking out US$20,000 (or $3,700 for Chinese patients) and undergoing a risky procedure. \u201cThey forget what they were like before,\u201d he says. The surgery itself could also lead to short-lived improvements by relieving pressure in the area, adds John Steeves, a spinal-cord injury specialist at ICORD. \u201cYou really need long-term follow-up,\u201d he says. Steeves, who has visited Huang's lab, says Huang has consistently ignored advice on how to use blind assessment, randomized controls and long-term observation. Other spinal-cord treatments offered in countries such as Brazil and Portugal are also gaining popularity despite the lack of such data. This has prompted a group of international researchers to draft guidelines to help patients and clinicians evaluate treatments. Sponsored by the International Campaign for Cures of Spinal Cord Injury Paralysis, the guidelines include recommendations and hard data to help distinguish the effects of a given treatment from other factors, says contributor Mark Tuszynski, a neuroscientist at the University of California, San Diego. For example, 40% of individuals show some spontaneous recovery after acute spinal-cord injury, so anecdotal stories of improvement don't necessarily mean a treatment works. The guidelines will be submitted to an academic journal this summer, and a simplified version translated into many languages. But getting the word out may not be easy. Paul Lu is a postdoctoral student in Tuszynski's lab who entered neurology after he was paralysed from the waist down in a car accident. A Chinese native, Lu has been trying to warn patients in China about Huang's procedures, but says his translation of the  Neurorehabilitation and Neural Repair  article was rejected by several journals and science-based newspapers. \u201cChinese journals like to claim that China is leading the world in cell transplants,\u201d says Lu. \u201cThey'd lose face if they print this.\u201d Last week, however, the  Chinese Journal of Spine and Spinal Cord  agreed to publish the translation in June. Readers will have to balance such reports with Huang's confidence, buoyed by patient testimony, in his therapy. \n                     Fetal-cell therapy: Paper chase \n                   \n                     Spinal injuries: In search of a miracle \n                   \n                     The International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) \n                   \n                     Development of spinal cord injury (SCI) clinical trials guidelines \n                   \n                     The International Campaign for Cures of Spinal Cord Injury Paralysis (ICCP) \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Vietnam and Thailand have stemmed the flow of cases by controlling the disease in animals. But in Indonesia, the cases keep coming. Every human case is a potential stepping stone to a pandemic virus, and each case in Indonesia should therefore be considered both a national and an international emergency. Controlling the disease in Indonesia is inherently difficult. The country has 240 million people \u2014 and 1.3 billion chickens \u2014 spread across some 6,000 inhabited islands. Political power in this fledgling democracy is also highly decentralized across the archipelago. The virus is now endemic in many of the country's millions of backyard farms. One reason is the initial delays in taking action, with Indonesia only belatedly admitting to the presence of H5N1 in poultry in January 2004. It has probably been present since August 2003. Surveillance and identification of H5N1 in animals and birds need to be substantially improved, as does clinical and epidemiological follow-up, if we are to get a handle on the science of what is happening in Indonesia. There is a need for strong coordination between those involved in public health and in animal health. Indonesia is now promptly reporting suspected and confirmed human cases to the World Health Organization (WHO); however, it is probably not detecting all cases. The mortality rate is also extremely high, with 12 of the 13 cases this year dying. That gives a 92% mortality rate, far higher than the global 56% rate. We need to identify and address the causes, such as delays in detecting cases. In particular, we need to compare the sequences of the virus in human cases and in surrounding poultry, to spot any changes in the virus that may be occurring in humans. Indonesia has generally been good at sharing human samples with the international community, but urgent requests for data on animal viruses found in the vicinity of human cases have been ignored. On the bright side, the country has developed a national control and preparedness strategy that was signed by President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono on 13 March. National and international pressure must be maintained to ensure that these improvements are sustainable. \n               THAILAND: Les Sims \n             \n               Consultant for the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) \n             The outlook for avian flu in Thailand is most encouraging. The country has experienced several waves of animal infection, but since a peak in summer 2004, the number of outbreaks has progressively decreased, and no new outbreaks have occurred in the past three months. One must be prudent, however, about the extent to which the strategies behind this success can be exported to other countries with structurally different poultry industries. Most of Thailand's poultry is in commercial flocks, in sharp contrast to Vietnam and China, which have many backyard farms. That said, some of the notable innovations in the Thai programme should be considered elsewhere. In particular, it has used village-level disease-spotters as surveillance sentinels. The procedure began in September 2004, when the government launched a nationwide survey. This involved hundreds of thousands of inspectors carrying out house-to-house searches in an attempt to obtain reliable data on incidence and so target control measures more effectively. \n               INDIA: Shahid Jameel \n             \n               Head of virology at the International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology, New Delhi \n             Avian flu was first reported in India in February in the Navapur district of the western state of Maharashtra. The government response has been fair to good, with a low-key, yet aggressive strategy in which enough manpower, containment gear and medicines were deployed in affected areas. Control is mainly by surveillance, and by culling birds in a 3-kilometre radius around outbreaks. One big weakness is the lack of laboratories that can carry out rapid surveillance. The entire country has only one facility with the containment security to handle bird H5N1 virus samples and only two that can process human samples. Communication with the public has been a problem. At the same time that several government health officials ate chicken on live television to show it was safe, chicken was banned from the canteen in the Indian parliament and removed from the menus on state-run Indian Airlines and Indian Railways. The High Security Animal Disease Laboratory in Bhopal is stretched. It is handling 4,000 samples a week and doesn't have the staff or capacity for this, which is leading to delays. Precious time is being lost in making decisions on where to cull, giving the virus the opportunity to spread. For example, positive results relating to an outbreak in Gujarat that began on 27 January were announced only on 16 March. The major challenge is to keep the virus out of backyard flocks. And we need to think about vaccination and other strategies besides mass culling, as chicken and eggs are a cheap source of protein for much of the population. \n               NIGERIA: Claude P. Muller \n             \n               Director of the Institute of Immunology, WHO Collaborative Center for Measles, Luxembourg \n             Avian flu broke out in commercial poultry farms in Kano and Kaduna states in northern Nigeria in January, but was misdiagnosed as Newcastle disease. H5N1 is at risk of becoming endemic in large parts of Africa, hitting already fragile food supplies and creating new opportunities for spread to humans. Despite the weakness of surveillance for avian flu in Africa, the international community has been very slow in reacting to its appearance on the continent. We have helped set up the only laboratory in Nigeria that can diagnose H5N1, with Ademola Owoade, a poultry veterinary surgeon at the University of Ibadan. One lab is not enough for a country of 129 million people. The state organizes the collection of samples, and we supply reagents and staff. Within a few days of setting the lab up, we found that the virus had already spread to the southwest, the hub of the country's poultry industry and far beyond the cordon sanitaire that the federal government had tried to set up in the north. It is probably safe to say that the virus is now endemic in the region. The requirement of the World Organisation for Animal Health and the FAO \u2014 that samples be confirmed at reference laboratories before being officially acknowledged \u2014 is also allowing the virus time to spread. Although the economic impact of false positives may be great, false positives are less important than false negatives in terms of catching the virus before it spreads. Poultry is the second-largest industry here after oil. Some farms have been very professional in taking comprehensive precautions, but many large farms have not (see  http://www.aphis.usda.gov/birdbiosecurity/hpai.html ). I believe that the virus cannot be contained in Africa without vaccination, as most farmers cannot afford to restock after culling their flocks. \n               AZERBAIJAN: Guenael Rodier \n             \n               WHO special adviser who coordinated the response in Azerbaijan \n             Azerbaijan last month reported seven cases in humans, of whom five have died \u2014 its first cases of the disease. Worryingly, six of the cases were a cluster, occurring in the small Daikyand settlement in the southeast. As there had been no obvious contact with poultry, this initially raised fears of possible human-to-human spread. Now, however, we believe we have pinned down the cause: direct contamination from wild birds. It is not proven, but all six were involved in defeathering wild birds. Educating the public about high-risk practices, such as defeathering and slaughtering, will be our key task here. \n               CHINA: Guan Yi \n             \n               Virologist at Hong Kong University \n             China has reported 16 human cases of H5N1 infection, 11 of them fatal. The latest case, reported in Shanghai on 24 March, is puzzling \u2014 like another recent case in Guangzhou \u2014 in that there were no reported poultry outbreaks nearby, and the victims had no close contact with poultry. We believe we may be looking at a route of contamination that has not been considered previously: direct and indirect contact with birds in live poultry markets. Work by my group supports this hypothesis. Birds tested in markets in southern China over the past six months show that, despite extensive vaccination, only 20\u201350% of birds in the markets carry antibodies to H5N1. And H5N1 virus could be isolated from around 1% of the birds in the market, even though they appear healthy. They seem to have some partial protection, but are still shedding virus, as the rest of the poultry population might be doing. And when we test viruses isolated from market poultry in the lab, they are still highly pathogenic in experimental chickens. This means that either these birds have developed some natural immunity or there is a problem with the quality of the vaccines used. Current vaccination programmes have not prevented the virus from becoming prevalent in poultry populations in this region. Looking back on five years of surveillance, it is also now clear that the incidence of H5N1 in domestic ducks and geese is much higher than in chickens, so these are the major vectors for H5N1. If we want to control H5N1 in China and southeast Asia, we need to control its spread in aquatic poultry. \n               Interviews by Declan Butler \n             \n                     Dreams of flu data \n                   \n                     Can cats spread avian flu? \n                   \n                     Disease surveillance needs a revolution \n                   \n                     Doubts hang over source of bird flu spread \n                   \n                     Thai dogs carry bird-flu virus, but will they spread it? \n                   \n                     WHO avian flu page \n                   \n                     World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) avian flu page \n                   \n                     Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) \n                   \n                     Connotea resources on avain flu \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

There is a \u201chigh possibility\u201d that fraud was involved in a series of RNA studies from the laboratory of biochemist Kazunari Taira, a year-long investigation by the University of Tokyo has found. The papers in question \u201chad no reproducibility and no credibility\u201d, according to a statement dated 29 March. The committee that carried out the inquiry also claims that a researcher on Taira's team may have faked data for the investigators, hoping to convince them that the results were reproducible. \u201cRaw data submitted to the committee were fake,\u201d says its chair, Yoichiro Matsumoto. Co-author Hiroaki Kawasaki allegedly printed data for the committee obtained using software that was not available in 2003, when the experiment was conducted. Kawasaki told  Nature  that he had possessed a demonstration copy of the software. The software maker, Applied Biosystems, told both the committee and  Nature  that no demonstration copy was available at the time. Tipped off by a whistleblower in Taira's lab, the committee also tracked down a record that Kawasaki bought an enzyme he claimed to have constructed himself. Kawasaki says he bought it as a control when repeating his experiment. \u201cI've never done anything wrong,\u201d he says. Taira has asked for retractions of four papers in question; he had already requested retraction of an earlier  Nature  paper 1 . So far, Kawasaki has not agreed to sign off on the retractions. Taira's laboratory has developed novel RNA technologies to identify genes related to cancer and other diseases, preventing them from being expressed. In one paper 2 , he and his colleagues reported that a human enzyme was expressed in the bacterium  Escherichia coli , and this could be useful in making small fragments of RNA to suppress genes. A second paper 3  explained that introduction of small RNAs can induce DNA methylation \u2014 a process involved in some diseases such as cancer \u2014 in mammalian cells. The phenomenon had been reported in plant cells. The paper was later corrected, but not retracted. On 26 March, Taira requested retraction of these two studies, along with two others 4 , 5 . In his statement to the committee, Taira says he requested the retractions because of \u201ca problem of research ethics\u201d, and that Kawasaki had failed to provide lab notebooks to support the original results.  Nature  is deliberating on the retraction request, says editor-in-chief Philip Campbell. When contacted by  Nature , Taira said he stood by everything in his statement. He has in the past denied any wrongdoing. Questions were first raised in April 2005 when the RNA Society of Japan, noting complaints from researchers, asked the University of Tokyo's School of Engineering to investigate whether 12 of Taira's papers were reproducible. The university selected a few of the papers and asked Taira to submit raw data by September. He failed to do so, blaming Kawasaki for allegedly not keeping good notebooks and storing back-up data on a computer that broke. The committee extended the deadline to the end of March, but again no evidence of reproducibility emerged. A separate investigation was undertaken by the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST), where Taira had headed a gene-discovery centre. Misconduct in nine of the twelve papers, it reported on 3 March, \u201ccould not be ruled out\u201d. One other paper was in the clear, and two were not scrutinized as they did not involve AIST research. Last week, the institute announced that it would not renew Taira's contract, which ended on 31 March. A separate committee, set up earlier this year at the University of Tokyo, interviewed Taira, Kawasaki and other lab members about the lab's management and the possibility of misconduct. It plans to report to the university's president by 10 April, and to pass the issue to the university's disciplinary panel, which will decide possible penalties in the next few months. \n                 Additional reporting by David Cyranoski \n               \n                     Doubts over biochemist's data expose holes in Japanese fraud laws \n                   \n                     Lack of lab notes casts doubt on RNA researcher's results \n                   \n                     The Taira Lab, University of Tokyo \n                   \n                     RNA Society of Japan \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Rex Dalton investigates. At San Francisco's new fine-arts museum, a stunning exhibition of South Pacific artefacts sheds light on the world of primitive peoples. The display includes about 400 specimens from Papua New Guinea \u2014 with adorned human skulls from the days of head-hunting, masks and shields portraying tribal spirits, and life-size carvings steeped in fertility rites. The de Young Museum offers scientists the first opportunity to study a rare collection of some 6,000 Melanesian artefacts. But the exhibition also engenders difficult questions \u2014 because at least nine of the artefacts seem to be the national cultural property of Papua New Guinea. Records show that these have been earmarked by the country's government as objects of cultural significance to the nation. Several anthropologists, many of whom have worked in Papua New Guinea, claim that the specimens were illegally exported. And other artefacts in the exhibition can allegedly be traced back to worldwide trade networks, in which misappropriated specimens are sold to antiquities dealers. In recent months, accusations and criminal charges have arisen against high-profile art dealers and museum leaders. An ongoing criminal trial in Italy has revealed that looted artefacts from ruins have been sold to fine-arts museums such as the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York and the Getty Center in Los Angeles. And some scholars at New York University are protesting over a $200-million donation to the university, to fund a centre for the study of the ancient world; they say the funds may be tainted by antiquity dealing. Concerns over the source of the de Young artefacts raise complex issues for the museum, recently rebuilt after it was damaged by an earthquake. Only 30 years independent, Papua New Guinea remains a poor nation, with little international clout or economic means to fight for its lost patrimony. Some question whether the country's Public Museum and Art Gallery, in Port Moresby, would have enough money to properly secure and care for the artefacts if they were returned. But others are adamant that the issue must be addressed. A 1965 law bans exports of national cultural property, says Barry Craig, curator of foreign ethnology at the Museum of South Australia in Adelaide. \u201cMaterial removed illegally should be returned. But it is up to the Papua New Guinea government,\u201d argues Craig, who served as a curator at Papua New Guinea's national museum from 1980 to 1983. The Papua New Guinea government has tried to crack down on illegal exports in the past. In 1972, working with the government, Brian Egloff, a University of Canberra ethnoarchaeologist, and Dirk Smidt, a Dutch ethnographer, shut down exports one weekend and discovered crates of prohibited artefacts ready for shipping abroad. Some were to go to Wayne Heathcote, an Australian collector, who has clashed with Papua New Guinea authorities over artefacts; Heathcote declined interview requests. But other artefacts have slipped out to auction or parlour deals, which can be lucrative; the donator of the de Young collection values his gift at $100 million. \n               Finding the source \n             Smidt, who has long championed Papua New Guinea patrimony, penned an article in the de Young catalogue on the current exhibition. Records show that he had previously entered several of the nine artefacts into Papua New Guinea's national-property catalogue. Smidt acknowledged that national property was in the collection, but declined further comment. Egloff, who has investigated questionable artefact purchases in Australia, says an independent audit should be conducted on the de Young specimens. \u201cThere are two issues,\u201d says Egloff. \u201cFirst, to understand the objects' place in society and how they came to the collection. And second, what to do with them.\u201d Sebastine Haraha, the enforcement officer for the Port Moresby museum, says he will inspect the artefacts in San Francisco next week, in order to confirm that they are national property. Museum files contain notes claiming Heathcote illegally purchased two of the artefacts in the 1970s, Haraha says. \u201cI expect all those that were removed illegally should go back.\u201d Officials at the de Young say they are taking the issue seriously. The museum's director, art historian John Buchanan, says he has begun an inquiry into the origin of the questioned artefacts. The de Young museum has a history of repatriating objects when appropriate, Buchanan says, and could do it again. \u201cWe want to be a positive player to resolve the puzzle,\u201d says Buchanan. \u201cThe way to do that is to be as transparent as we can.\u201d The nine objects in question include a Karawari mask from the Middle Sepik River (pictured, above bottom); a wooden Garamut slit gong, about three metres long; and a metre-tall carving showing a Kaningara woman copulating, preying-mantis style (pictured, above top). Such unique artefacts cry out for study, but not as pieces of art, says anthropologist Adrienne Kaeppler, Oceania curator at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington DC. \u201cThese pieces need to be studied in conjunction with people knowledgeable about the culture from which they were taken.\u201d \n               Homeward bound? \n             Already, researchers at the University of Arizona in Tucson have conducted radiocarbon analysis on 150 specimens. More than 30 are at least 300 years old \u2014 with one mask dating to 1,200 years ago. But the questioned provenance of some specimens may hamper research on the collection. One Smithsonian scientist says privately, \u201cWe wouldn't go near it now.\u201d The Melanesian collection was donated by John and Marcia Friede. John Friede, who began collecting artefacts about 40 years ago, has purchased former European museum collections, expropriated in the late 1800s by missionaries. And for decades, he bought specimens from international dealers, such as Heathcote. Friede denies knowing any of the Melanesian artefacts were national cultural property, insisting that he did not engage in any illegal exports. \u201cDealers don't tell you where they get them,\u201d he says, adding: \u201cIt really doesn't matter a great deal.\u201d Repatriating the artefacts is \u201ccrazy\u201d, he says. \u201cThey are a lot better off in San Francisco.\u201d If international law-enforcement authorities confirmed that certain pieces were stolen, Friede says, he could see them being returned. \u201cIf a few specimens cause the collection to be thought of as nasty, illegal stuff, it would be a shame. My desire is to create a collection to define the greatness of the art.\u201d Papua New Guinea's ambassador to the United States, Evan Paki, expressed surprise when  Nature  pointed out that the de Young collection probably contained national property, saying: \u201cI'm not aware of that. I don't want to set something in motion. But if something is clearly protected, we would want it returned.\u201d And in Papua New Guinea, the long wait for the repatriation of national property continues. As Prime Minister Michael Somare wrote in 1974: \u201cWe view our masks and art as living spirits with fixed abodes. It is not right they should be stored in New York, Paris, Bonn or elsewhere.\u201d \n                     De young \u2013 The Jolika Collection of New Guinea Art \n                   \n                     University of Arizona on radiocarbon dating \n                   \n                     Geoscience Australia article on artefact dates \n                   \n                     Hood Museum of Art exhibition \n                   \n                     Archaeology article on artefact trading \n                   \n                     Art Knowledge News on artefact returns \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Washington DC The US Secretary of Energy, Samuel Bodman, has decided to disband the Department of Energy's principal independent advisory board on scientific and technical matters. The Secretary of Energy Advisory Board (SEAB), which has existed in one form or another since 1978, will end after a final meeting this spring. Bodman made the decision about a month ago in a closed-door meeting with senior staff, says department spokesman Craig Stevens. Some observers say that the decision is another example of the Bush administration's reluctance to accept outside scientific advice (see  page 716 ). \u201cThis decision is part of a bigger picture,\u201d says Stephen Dean, president of Fusion Power Associates, a non-profit organization based in Gaithersburg, Maryland, that promotes fusion research. \u201cThis administration doesn't want outside advisory groups to tell it what to do.\u201d But Stevens says that the choice has more to do with the scientific background of Bodman, who is a chemical engineer by training, than a desire to limit scientific advice. \u201cThe secretary has an understanding of science and scientific processes,\u201d Stevens says. \u201cHe would rather hear firsthand from the folks in the department.\u201d Stevens adds that plenty of direction is provided by the Advanced Energy and American Competitiveness Initiatives, which are intended to boost work on energy and basic research. The 28-member, politically appointed SEAB is a mix of distinguished scientists, such as Nobel laureate Burton Richter, and business executives, such as former ExxonMobil chairman Lee Raymond. But not all of its reports have been influential, says Mark Marin, a lobbyist with Lewis-Burke Associates in Washington DC. One recent report, on research funding in the department, was incorporated into the president's competitiveness initiative, but a study on laboratory contracting practices was largely ignored. The panel's most recent report, in July 2005, recommended drastic restructuring of the nation's nuclear-weapons labs (see  Nature   436 , 316; 2005).

A Canadian federal agency has denied funding to a science-education researcher partly because of its doubts about the theory of evolution. Brian Alters, director of the Evolution Education Research Centre at McGill University in Montreal, had proposed a study of the effects of the popularization of intelligent design \u2014 the idea that an intelligent creator shaped life \u2014 on Canadian students, teachers, parents, administrators and policy-makers. At a public lecture on 29 March, Alters revealed excerpts from the rejection letter he received from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC). The letter stated that, among its reasons for rejection, the committee felt there was inadequate \u201cjustification for the assumption in the proposal that the theory of evolution, and not intelligent-design theory, was correct.\u201d \u201cIt illustrates how the misunderstanding of evolution and intelligent design can go to all levels of Canadian society,\u201d says Alters. David Green, director of McGill University's Redpath natural-history museum, adds: \u201cI was quite surprised that such an opinion could be tendered by a high-powered granting agency.\u201d The SSHRC is the top social-sciences funding agency in Canada. Spokeswoman Eva Schacherl says its funding decisions are based on the comments submitted by a committee of peer reviewers, and that the council cannot comment on the sentence in question. \u201cWe rely on the expertise of our committees to make recommendations,\u201d she says. Susan Bennett, an English professor at the University of Calgary in Alberta and chair of the SSHRC committee, could not be reached for comment by the time  Nature  went to press. The maximum value of Alters's requested grant was Can$40,000 (US$34,000). He has received funding from the SSHRC before; for instance, his centre was awarded a Can$175,000-grant to study the understanding of biological evolution in Islamic societies. Jennifer Robinson, associate vice-principal for communications at McGill, says the university will ask the council to review its decision. \u201cIn our view it is a factual error,\u201d she says. \u201cThe theory of evolution is a well-established science, and intelligent design is a religious belief.\u201d Philip Sadler, a board member of the centre and director of science education at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge, Massachusetts, is more philosophical. \u201cIf he was trying to answer the question as to whether all this popularization had had an impact, he just saved the government $40,000,\u201d says Sadler. \u201cHe found the evidence without doing the study.\u201d \n                     Intelligent design verdict set to sway other cases \n                   \n                     Intelligent design: Who has designs on your students' minds? \n                   \n                     Social Sciences and Research Council of Canada \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

The Wellcome Trust put its financial weight behind Britain's Royal Society last week in order to rescue a prized seventeenth-century manuscript from bidders at Bonhams auction house in London. The society claims that the 520-page treasure, handwritten by the physicist Robert Hooke, was taken from its archives some 300 years ago, and put out a public plea to recover the papers (see  Nature   439 , 638\u2013639; 200610.1038/439638a ). The privately funded Wellcome Trust pledged half of the \u00a31 million (US$1.7 million) that the society used to negotiate an eleventh-hour deal with the manuscript's vendors. The papers document the society's meetings from 1661 to 1682, and feature many personal comments from Hooke, former secretary of the society and one of its most influential scientists. The manuscript was found in a private house in Hampshire last year. When it became apparent in February that the papers were to be auctioned off, the society appealed for benefactors. The resulting \u00a31 million came from 146 separate pledges, 122 of which were from Royal Society fellows. Donations ranged from \u00a35 to \u00a3500,000, although a society spokesman told  Nature  that the Wellcome Trust was not the only substantial donor. \u201cWe are very grateful,\u201d says the Royal Society's president, Martin Rees. \u201cWe're delighted because the manuscript has gone to its natural place.\u201d The society hopes to take delivery of the document this month, and is planning to display it as part of a summer exhibition at the society's London headquarters. Historians will scrutinize the handwritten papers for discrepancies with the formal minutes of the meetings, which the society already has. The results may resolve several disputes, such as Hooke's claim that he was the original inventor of the spring-balance watch.

Perhaps the relationship never had a chance. Robert Laughlin, who shared the 1998 Nobel Prize in Physics for his work on quantum fluids, was hired in July 2004 to reform the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) in Daejeon. Last week, the institute's board of trustees decided not to renew his two-year contract. Laughlin, formerly of Stanford University in California, was recruited by the office of South Korea's president, Moo Hyun Roh, to help shake up the country's university system. The reforms he proposed were fairly standard from a US perspective: he advocated competitive hiring of faculty at market rates; expanding the undergraduate student body; and running preparatory undergraduate degrees in medicine, law and business. Many of KAIST's 400 or so professors did not agree with Laughlin's approach. Of 278 that took part in a vote, 89% said they did not want him to continue. Choon Sup Yoon, a condensed-matter physicist who heads the faculty association, says that Laughlin's plans to expand the university's professional schools and humanities departments would have undermined KAIST's traditional status as a science and technology powerhouse. \u201cHis philosophy is totally different from what KAIST is about,\u201d says Yoon. Another KAIST researcher, who did not want to be named, says the problem was more to do with Laughlin's attitude. \u201cThe content was not that bad. But he made enemies, probably because of a lack of experience in running an organization,\u201d he says. Laughlin admits that he lacked experience, but says that was not the real problem. The point of his dismissal, he says, \u201cwas to discredit the policy of hiring outsiders\u201d. It was a stormy end to a bitter affair in which Laughlin was even at times accused of abusing his vacation privileges. Some say it was inevitable. Chan-Mo Park, head of Pohang University of Science and Technology where Laughlin still holds a post as distinguished professor, says that philosophies simply clashed. \u201cEverything resulted from a cultural difference between the two countries,\u201d says Park. \u201cIt's a very sad story.\u201d Laughlin finishes at KAIST in mid-July and will return to Stanford to resume teaching in the autumn. \n                     Fresh horizons South Korea \n                   \n                     Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Examinations of four whales found stranded along the Spanish coast in January seem to confirm a 2003  Nature  report linking sonar to the deaths of several beaked whales. In recent years, naval sonar devices have been the suspected cause of an increasing number of whale strandings worldwide. The whales are thought to take evasive action to avoid the noise, sometimes diving and surfacing until they suffer decompression sickness and die. In 2003, British and Spanish researchers reported that Cuvier's beaked whales ( Ziphius cavirostris ), stranded off the Canary Islands the previous year, had deadly gas-bubble lesions called emboli in their livers. They suggested these were caused by decompression (P. D. Jepson  et al .  Nature   425 , 575\u2013576; 2003). After a group of beaked whales went ashore in January, along Spain's Costa del Sol, the Spanish Cetacean Society in Madrid called veterinarian Antonio Fernandez to perform necropsies on four of the animals. He and his colleagues from the University of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria found the same embolic syndrome as that found in the 2003 study. \u201cThis is the first confirmation of the 2003 report,\u201d says veterinarian Paul Jepson of the Zoological Society of London, lead author of that article. The new findings are expected to be published in coming months. Officials at the Cetacean Society suspect that mid-frequency naval sonar caused the strandings. But Fernandez notes that the ships that might have been responsible have not been identified. Earlier this month, about 45 pilot whales died after stranding on the western side of the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia, following joint US and Indonesian naval exercises in the nearby Macassar Strait. The cause of the stranding is under investigation. Some US Navy officials, and oceanographers who use devices to generate air bursts underwater for seismic studies, have been accused of blocking efforts to uncover the links between noise and whale strandings (see  Nature   439 , 376\u2013377; 2006). \n                     Panel quits in row over sonar damage \n                   \n                     Gas-bubble lesions in stranded cetaceans \n                   \n                     Scientists split over regulations on sonar use \n                   \n                     Spanish Cetacean Society \n                   \n                     Veterinary Pathology article on whales and sonar \n                   \n                     Natural Resources Defense Council on protecting whales from sonar \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

A rare resignation has focused attention on scientific societies' treatment of women. Theresa Markow, president of the Society for the Study of Evolution (SSE), has stepped down in protest that women were not adequately considered for the editorship of its journal,  Evolution . Many think the incident is symptomatic of a wider issue. \u201cI see this as truly problematic,\u201d says Patricia Gowaty, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Georgia in Athens. \u201cAnd it is not unique to the SSE.\u201d The society's rules state that it should create a nominating committee to choose a chief editor. But instead, the society appointed a man after informal queries. It then rejected Markow's request to redo the process. Markow, a geneticist at the University of Arizona in Tucson, resigned the SSE presidency on 18 March, about ten weeks into her term. \u201cI strongly feel that being inclusive with respect to gender ... is non-negotiable,\u201d Markow wrote in her resignation letter. \u201cI cannot serve as president of a society when the council and I share such major contrasts of view.\u201d Officers at the SSE admit the selection process was flawed, adding that they regret Markow's departure. \u201cThis resignation has brought into focus the issue of participation of women,\u201d says ecologist Dolph Schluter of the University of British Columbia, Vancouver. \u201cThe society should address that.\u201d Schluter is the SSE's previous president, and he oversaw the search for an editor. A committee has been formed to tackle the issue, Schluter points out. However, the society's 2,400 members were not informed of Markow's resignation until 11 April, after  Nature  called for comment. In the SSE's nearly 60 years,  Evolution  has had only one female editor \u2014 Markow, from 1995 to 1999. Other journals are similar. Daphne Fairbairn, an evolutionary biologist at the University of California, Riverside, says she had a \u201cdiscouraging\u201d experience when she proposed female candidates for an editing position at the  Journal of Evolutionary Biology , published by the European Society for Evolutionary Biology. \u201cNo one else came up with a single woman candidate,\u201d says Fairbairn. \u201cWhen I raised the issue, they looked at me dumbly.\u201d They would say \u2018she is nasty\u2019, or \u2018she didn't do a good job\u2019. No one was going through the men's list and saying those things. She says society leaders criticized her suggestions unfairly. \u201cThey would say \u2018she is nasty\u2019, or \u2018she didn't do a good job\u2019. No one was going through the men's list and saying those things.\u201d When Fairbairn's term as North American editor ends, the journal will have no female editors. Juha Meril\u00e4, a biologist at the University of Helsinki in Finland and the journal's editor-in-chief, acknowledges there are difficulties appointing women. There are few women at high levels of science in Europe, he says, so the pool of candidates is small. \u201cI am, of course, a little disappointed,\u201d he says. \u201cI went through quite a few names; all declined because of other responsibilities.\u201d The journal of the American Ornithologists' Union,  The Auk , has not had a woman editor in its 123-year history. But Kimberley Sullivan, an ornithologist at Utah State University in Logan, has a grant from the US National Science Foundation (NSF) to address such issues, and seems to be making progress. The society's existing fellows pick new fellows at the union's annual meeting, from a slate of nominees. At her first fellows' meeting, Sullivan says women nominees were \u201ctrashed\u201d. \u201cThey started blackballing nominees, with someone saying: \u2018I was with her on a field trip and she misidentified a bird\u2019,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was terrible.\u201d The younger men on the slate came in for the same treatment, she says. Sullivan presented data from her NSF study at last years' meeting, arguing that the union's tactics were turning it \u201cfrom an old boys' club into an old men's society\u201d. For the first time, the entire slate of prospective fellows was inducted without criticism. \u201cI think the organization has been an old boys' club,\u201d says president-elect Erica Dunn, of the Canadian Wildlife Service in Ottawa. \u201cBut the mood is to change.\u201d For Robin Bell, a geophysicist at Columbia University in New York who has an NSF grant to promote women in Earth sciences, change can't come soon enough. \u201cThis is a civil rights issue,\u201d she says. \u201cWe are trying to create women leaders at the institutional level.\u201d \n                     AACU article Is There a Global Warming Toward Women in Academia? \n                   \n                     National Science Foundation (NSF) Advance programme \n                   \n                     Society for the Study of Evolution \n                   \n                     The American Ornithologists' Union \n                   \n                     European Society for Evolutionary Biology \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},
{"file_id": "440982a", "url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/440982a", "year": 2006, "authors": [], "parsed_as_year": "2006_or_before", "body": "Twenty years after the worst nuclear accident in history, arguments over the death toll of Chernobyl are as politically charged as ever, reports Mark Peplow. No more than 4,000 people are likely to die as a result of Chernobyl. That was the conclusion released by the United Nations and the governments of Ukraine, Belarus and Russia in September last year, in the most comprehensive assessment of the accident so far. But despite promising \u201cdefinitive\u201d answers the report, based on two decades of research, has done little to resolve the debate over Chernobyl's impact. The estimate drew howls of protest from environmental groups, which accused the UN's Chernobyl Forum of a whitewash. And scientists whose work is cited in the report are concerned about how their figures were presented, pointing out that the true cost of the disaster will not be known for decades to come, if ever. Chernobyl's runaway nuclear reaction in 1986 was triggered by a faulty safety test, and exacerbated by a design flaw that caused a catastrophic temperature rise in the reactor core. This caused about 6.7 tonnes of radioactive material to spread for hundreds of kilometres around the site. Two of the most significant elements in the chemical cocktail were iodine and caesium, and the most devastating effects were seen within a few tens of kilometres of the reactor, in the region where Ukraine, Belarus and Russia meet. In the confusion that followed, local families continued to graze and milk their cattle on contaminated land. Many predicted that the accident would cause hundreds of thousands of cancers. \n               Cooking the books? \n             The forum reports that the fallout has since caused about 4,000 cases of thyroid cancer, mainly in children and adolescents. But just 15 of these patients have died. Along with highly exposed rescue workers who brought the reactor inferno under control, 62 deaths have been attributed directly to the accident so far. The report also says that there has been no significant increase so far in the incidence of other cancers. In total, it said, \u201cup to 4,000 people\u201d may ultimately die as a direct result of the disaster \u2014 much lower than previous estimates. That conclusion upsets many. \u201cThe report gave a completely misleading view of the health consequences of the accident,\u201d says Ed Lyman, a nuclear-power expert with the Union of Concerned Scientists in Washington DC. The argument stems from uncertainty about the health effects of low doses of radiation. Evidence from survivors of the atomic bombs dropped on Nagasaki and Hiroshima has allowed researchers to predict the effects of high doses. But as the exposure drops, so does the understanding of its impact. Last year, a working group of the US National Research Council concluded that even tiny amounts of radiation cannot be considered safe. In contrast, the forum based its headline figure on just the 600,000 people exposed to the most radiation, predicting that roughly 4,000 of them will die as a result. The full report acknowledges that, of 6.8 million others living further from the explosion who received a much lower dose, Chernobyl will kill another 5,000 \u2014 more than doubling the projected death toll. But this is not mentioned in the report's 50-page summary or the accompanying press release. The figures come from a study published in 1996 by Elisabeth Cardis of the International Agency for Research on Cancer in Lyon, France. \u201cI was very shocked that they were quoting figures we had found ten years ago,\u201d says Cardis. \u201cI didn't expect the numbers to be picked up and used in a press release without qualification.\u201d Even the forum's chair, Burton Bennett, former head of the Radiation Effects Research Foundation in Hiroshima, Japan, says caveats about the figures should have been clearer. But he points out that the extra 6.8 million people were, on average, exposed to a radiation dose of just 7 millisieverts \u2014 little more than the natural background delivers in a year in most parts of the world. I was sick of seeing wild figures being reported by reputable organizations and attributed to the UN. Melissa Fleming, a press officer working at the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna, who helped coordinate the report's publicity, says the scientists involved checked the press material. But she admits a decision was made to focus on the lower 4,000 figure, partly as a reaction to the inflated estimates of past decades. \u201cI was sick of seeing wild figures being reported by reputable organizations that were attributed to the UN,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was a bold action to put out a new figure that was much less than conventional wisdom.\u201d The figure has been removed from the final summary, however, published this month. \n               Uncertain legacy \n             Some of the higher death tolls come from those who believe that estimates of those potentially affected should extend to everyone in Europe (see map). In a report commissioned by Green Party members of the European Parliament, radiation scientist Ian Fairlie calculated that of the hundreds of millions of people who could possibly have received any radiation at all from Chernobyl, 30,000\u201360,000 could die as a result (see  http://tinyurl.com/rpzsq ). Cardis is also about to publish a study of the pan-European impact. She concludes that, of 570 million people in Europe at the time, 16,000 will ultimately die as a result of the accident \u2014 0.01% of all cancer deaths. But she says it will be virtually impossible to assess the ultimate death toll. Cancer causes about a quarter of all deaths in Europe, so weeding out those cases triggered by Chernobyl cannot be done with statistical confidence. \u201cWe'll never be able to say whether we were right or not,\u201d she says. The fact that we haven't seen anything doesn't mean that there isn't an effect. It's just too early. Some researchers also take issue with the report's conclusion that there are no hereditary effects in children born after the disaster. \u201cThe fact that we haven't seen anything doesn't mean there isn't an effect,\u201d says Cardis. \u201cIt's just too early to see an increase.\u201d Until Chernobyl survivors' children and grandchildren grow up, the only way to assess such effects is to look for DNA mutations. Yuri Dubrova, a geneticist at the University of Leicester, UK, has found increased genetic changes in the children of irradiated parents \u2014 but the fingerprinting technique he used only allowed him to look at non-coding regions, known as junk DNA (Y. E. Dubrova  et al .  Nature   380 , 683\u2013686; 1996). He argues that coding regions are also likely to be affected. DNA chips currently being developed will allow mass screening of samples from thousands of people, he says, and could pick up effects too small to have been spotted so far. \u201cThe real necessity now is to organize proper blood-sample banks,\u201d he says. Many are calling for research to track effects such as cancer or infertility in subsequent generations (see  page 993 ). But although such monitoring is seen as essential, some worry that wrangling over death tolls and radiation risk is hampering survivors' recovery. \n               Against apathy \n             \u201cWhat we'd like people to take away is not the numbers game,\u201d says Louisa Vinton, who manages Chernobyl projects at the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). Rough estimates of death tolls allow governments to set up policies to manage the future health effects. But she says the focus on the figure of 4,000 obscured a more important message of the report: that myths about the threat of radiation have created a \u201cparalysing fatalism\u201d among residents of affected areas. Instead Vinton hopes that Chernobyl's legacy can be seen as a social problem. The UNDP says that Chernobyl's most serious impact was on the mental health of about 7 million people labelled as victims of the accident. Aid from the governments of Russia, Belarus and Ukraine has created a culture of dependency, it argues, which may have encouraged exaggerated fears of ill-health. \u201cWe go to communities where people have just given up,\u201d says Vinton. Poor diet, lack of exercise and smoking are all linked to such apathy. She admits it is hard to separate the stress of Chernobyl from the effects of collapse of the Soviet Union. But Chernobyl aid has drained resources. In 1991, Belarus spent 22.3% of its budget on aid; today that figure is still 6%. The forum's report recommends that governments reassign the cash towards regenerating the region and developing infrastructure. The hottest spots will be radioactive for centuries. But the most prevalent isotope, caesium-137, has a half-life of about 30 years and scientists estimate that much of the abandoned area will become habitable over coming decades. The 30-kilometre exclusion zone around Chernobyl is likely to remain off limits. But the report suggests that in other evacuated areas roads should be rebuilt, and people encouraged to start farms and businesses. Projects to build hospitals and schools are already helping people to help themselves, says Vinton: \u201cI've seen the before and after. People stand up straight and bubble over with excitement about the next plan.\u201d \n                     Learning from Chernobyl \n                   \n                     Nuclear power: Chernobyl and the future: when the price is right \n                   \n                     Nuclear waste: Chernobyl and the future: Forward planning \n                   \n                     Chernobyl and the future: Too soon for a final diagnosis \n                   \n                     Physical sciences news channel \n                   \n                     Alexander Orlov, University of Cambridge \n                   \n                     Revisiting Chernobyl: 20 years later (IAEA) \n                   \n                     Chernobyl.info \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

The discovery that lakes hidden deep beneath the Antarctic ice could burst under pressure \u201clike champagne corks\u201d is prompting a rethink of plans to explore the watery world under the continent's four-kilometre-thick ice sheet. Any flooding might also make its way to the sea, a prospect that has sparked a debate about whether it could affect global climate. Antarctica's subglacial lakes have attracted close attention since researchers first realized, around a decade ago, that they may have been isolated for millions of years and so could harbour unique microbial ecosystems. But as awareness has grown, so have the disputes. Many researchers have objected to Russian plans to drill into one of the largest and best-studied bodies of water, Lake Vostok, fearing that it could become contaminated. Sooner or later the lakes will go off like champagne corks. The new data, published on  page 1033  of this issue, suggest that water from melting ice is pressurizing subglacial lakes, causing rivers with a flow equivalent to that of the Thames to form beneath the ice sheet. \u201cSooner or later the lakes will go off like champagne corks,\u201d says Duncan Wingham, a physicist at University College London and lead author on the study. Wingham's ideas are based on changes in the height of the Antarctic ice sheet revealed by radar devices on the ERS-2 orbiting satellite. A 600-square-kilometre area of East Antarctica dropped by 3 metres in 1997. Around the same time, the ice at two regions 290 km east of this area rose by about a metre (see graphic). Several lakes are known to exist in these regions, so Wingham and his colleagues conclude that the changes are caused by about 1.8 cubic kilometres of water flooding between previously isolated lakes. They suggest that as melting ice flowed into the lakes, changes in pressure forced open tiny channels (see  'Glaciology: Ice-sheet plumbing in Antarctica' ), causing a flood that lasted for about a year. As the flow subsided, the weight of ice closed the tunnel and sealed the lake again. About 150 subglacial lakes have already been identified in Antarctica, but thousands more may exist, and the same process could affect them all. Wingham doubts whether all the lakes are connected, but says that some are linked like \u201cbeads on a string\u201d by channels that periodically burst open. If lakes such as Vostok were not isolated, they would be less interesting to researchers, although even if they are linked they could still share a unique ecosystem. And if they are connected, the risks associated with drilling increase. \u201cIf we accidentally contaminate one lake, will we contaminate a series of lakes via hydrological conduits?\u201d asks John Priscu, a microbial ecologist at Montana State University in Bozeman, who studies subglacial lakes. He says Wingham's results should be considered when planning exploration projects. US and European researchers are debating how best to minimize the risk of contamination, and don't expect to be ready to drill into a lake before the end of the decade. But a Russian team plans to enter Lake Vostok as early as 2007. That worries others, because the borehole, which currently ends 100 metres above the surface of the lake, contains drilling fluid that could potentially contaminate the water. Valery Lukin of the Arctic and Antarctic Research Institute in St Petersburg, head of the Russian drilling efforts, says the Wingham paper \u201cwill not influence plans to drill into Vostok\u201d. Lukin says his team is confident that the pressure in Lake Vostok will force water up into the borehole, where it will freeze and act as a cap to prevent contamination. Researchers are also asking what would happen if a large subglacial lake discharged into the sea. Antarctica's edge has twisting channels in the rock that researchers believe were formed in the Miocene, 13 million years ago, by the drainage of subglacial lakes. David Marchant, a geologist at Boston University in Massachusetts, says the water would have drained into the ocean, where it could have disrupted circulation patterns and influenced global climate. So this process could conceivably occur again. \u201cIt depends on the total volume of water that drains into the ocean and how fast it gets there,\u201d he says. To determine the risk, Marchant says that a better understanding of the timing and size of the Miocene floods and the climate changes of the period is needed. Researchers will also need to work out which modern lakes are connected. \n                     Russian bid to drill Antarctic lake gets chilly response \n                   \n                     Lake Vostok map forces exploration rethink \n                   \n                     Russia pulls out of Antarctic station \n                   \n                     Life in the deep freeze \n                   \n                     Climate Change in focus \n                   \n                     Subglacial Antarctic Lake Exploration group \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

When an object is 16 billion kilometres away but probably only half the width of the United States, how do you work out precisely how big it is? That was the challenge faced by teams estimating the size of UB 313 , the potential \u2018tenth planet\u2019 in our Solar System, which was first spotted in 2003. So far two teams have tried, and come up with different answers. The first group, led by Frank Bertoldi, an astronomer at the University of Bonn, Germany, measured how much heat UB 313  emits, and compared it with the body's predicted temperature, based on its distance from the Sun. The team calculated that UB 313  has a diameter of around 3,000 kilometres (F. Bertoldi  et al .  Nature   439 , 563\u2013564; 2006). Now a team led by Michael Brown, the planetary scientist at the California Institute of Technology whose group discovered UB 313 , has made its own estimate using the Hubble Space Telescope. The researchers took 28 images of UB 313  and inferred its size using its distance from Earth and the width of the object in the image \u2014 just 1.5 pixels across. They reckon it is around 2,400 kilometres in diameter, closer to the size of Pluto (see graphic). That would make UB 313  unusually bright for its size. Brown's team suggested on 11 April that the body reflects 86% of the light that falls on it. The only object more reflective in the Solar System is Enceladus, a saturnian moon that gets its shiny surface from geysers, which spew water into the object's freezing atmosphere, creating ice on the surface. Analysis of light reflected by UB 313  shows that its high reflectivity is probably due to a coating of frozen methane. But that prompts questions about how the methane got there, and why cosmic rays, which split hydrogen atoms from methane molecules, have not added a layer of soot to the surface. This process is thought to be responsible for red patches on Pluto's surface, which reflects a maximum of 60% of the light that falls on it. \u201cWhy does it have higher ice coverage than Pluto? We don't understand it well,\u201d says Bertoldi. The body may be leaking methane from its warmer interior. Or it could be because UB 313  used to be much closer to the Sun, so it may have had a methane atmosphere that froze to its surface as it moved farther out. The same fate probably awaits Pluto as its elliptical orbit takes it away from the Sun. \n                     Possible planets left with no name \n                   \n                     'Tenth Planet' found to be a whopper \n                   \n                     Astronomers reject the term 'planet' \n                   \n                     Astronomers to decide what makes a planet \n                   \n                     Santa and little helper seen beyond Pluto \n                   \n                     Video Streaming: 2 new moons for Pluto \n                   \n                     Michael Brown, California Institute of Technology \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

What kind of person does it take to run a $4.8-billion research powerhouse?  Nature  asked some top cancer researchers for their thoughts. \n               Donald McDonald \n             \n               University of California, San Francisco \n             It is much easier to describe the perfect person to be director of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) than to find him or her. That person would need to balance the needs, hopes and challenges of state-of-the-art clinical oncologists with those of basic scientists. The ideal candidate must understand the inner workings of the NCI as the pace-setting institute that it is, but also as one of 27 separate institutes and centres \u2014 with competing identities, missions and needs \u2014 that make up the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Also, this person will have to address the challenges faced by cancer research, like all biomedical research, with declining funding and the changing political climate. One approach would be to look for someone within the NIH \u2014 someone who recognizes all of these problems yet is not daunted by the financial and political conditions. An example would be the current NCI deputy director, John Niederhuber. \n               Bert Vogelstein \n             \n               Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland \n             I would suggest Bill Gates as the new director, for two reasons. First, he is one of the few people who could make up shortfalls in funding. Second, and more seriously, he would bring a business perspective that is sorely needed. The NCI is riddled with old programmes that are viewed almost as entitlements and have hindered past directors from realizing their visions. These vestiges of the past drastically limit the agency's ability to support novel initiatives and, most importantly, new investigators. Just as a business evaluates each of its products in an effort to maximize profits, each NCI programme should be subjected to a \u201czero-based budgeting\u201d analysis based on scientific or clinical productivity and the likely impact on disease. \n               Mary-Claire King \n             \n               University of Washington, Seattle \n             In my view, the next NCI director should have direct experience of NCI-funded, extramural research in his or her own lab; experience of translating research into patient care; and knowledge of how the NIH and NCI work. I would begin my list with the current directors of the 39 NCI-designated Comprehensive Cancer Centers. These people are respected, and have worked for cancer patients and researchers for their entire careers. \n               Waun Ki Hong \n             \n               University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston \n             The NCI director must have a strong track record as a cancer researcher. This person needs a really strong vision and passion for cancer research. She or he must be an excellent advocate with keen political skills. And they must be highly respected and recognized by their peers in the cancer community. With these qualities in mind, I think any of the following people would make a fine director: Phillip Sharp of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology; Max Wicha of the University of Michigan;Harold Moses at the Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center; and Martin Abeloff at Johns Hopkins University. \n               Hellmut Augustin \n             \n               University of Freiburg, Germany \n             Thirty years of cutting-edge research have given Harold Varmus a deep understanding of the biology of cancer. Commenting on an American issue from a European perspective is like interfering in domestic affairs \u2014 usually not well appreciated. On second thoughts, it is quite tempting. It should be a strong personality who is well rooted in basic as well as translational oncology research, a scientist with a vision beyond the tumour-cell-centric view, and probably (but not necessarily) an MD or an MD/PhD. The job needs someone from outside who can motivate and develop a new corporate identity at the agency, a person of the highest degree of scientific integrity, and an efficient administrator with excellent communication skills. The first person who comes to mind who would fulfil such criteria is Carl-Henrik Heldin at the Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research in Uppsala, Sweden. But why not a female scientist? Margaret Kripke of M. D. Anderson is a member of the President's Cancer Panel. How about a strong basic scientist with an industry background, such as Mark Fishman of the Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research? Or a bona fide cancer researcher: Bert Vogelstein, Doug Hanahan, Robert Weinberg of the Whitehead Institute or...? Well, a European should probably not interfere in domestic affairs! \n               Douglas Hanahan \n             \n               University of California, San Francisco \n             Bill Gates would bring a business perspective that is sorely needed. I would choose Harold Varmus, currently president of the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. Thirty years of cutting-edge research have given Varmus a deep understanding of the biology and genetics of cancer. Formerly director of the NIH, he knows about leading a major government agency. Now, as president of Sloan-Kettering, he has assembled an impressive team in basic, translational and clinical cancer research and cancer care, and has recruited world-class scientists and physicians to his institution. This combination of research excellence, grounding in medicine and experience in relevant institutional leadership has uniquely prepared Varmus to guide the NCI and the cancer research community. \n               Marc Lippman \n             \n               University of Michigan School of Medicine, Ann Arbor \n             I think the ideal candidate should be seen by scientists and others in the field as scholarly, original in their thinking, and able to capture the enthusiasm and involvement of the many diverse constituencies that make up the community of people who dedicate their lives to eradicating cancer. Here is an eclectic set of names who I think meet all of those criteria: Mina Bissell of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; Isaiah Fidler of the University of Texas M. D.

Washington DC NASA reversed two decisions in one day on 27 March, reinstating the Dawn asteroid mission cancelled earlier this month and restoring some funds cut from astrobiology research. Both announcements have left scientists happy but also puzzled by a seemingly erratic decision-making process at the space agency, where managers are struggling to pay for an ambitious slate of science missions with a shrinking budget. The US$446-million Dawn mission is expected to launch in July 2007 to study the asteroids Vesta and Ceres. The mission had been scheduled to launch this June, but last autumn, NASA stopped work on the project, owing to technical problems and cost overruns. Although an independent assessment team reported in January that there were no technical barriers to launch, NASA associate administrator Mary Cleave cancelled the mission on 2 March. Her decision angered space scientists in the United States and in Germany, which is contributing funds and expertise to the mission. Charles Elachi, director of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, where Dawn is managed, asked NASA headquarters for a review. A team headed by associate administrator Rex Geveden decided on 23 March that the technical and cost issues were sufficiently in hand to permit launch. Scientists attending an astrobiology meeting from 26 to 30 March in Washington DC also heard of a reprieve, albeit a partial one. Carl Pilcher, NASA's senior scientist for astrobiology, had informed the community just last week that projected budget cuts of 50% meant that any grant proposals received in 2005 would be unlikely to be funded. He also said there would be no solicitation for proposals this year. At the Washington meeting, Pilcher said NASA headquarters has decided to restore enough money to award at least half the expected number of grants from 2005. Most astrobiologists at the meeting applauded the news, but vowed to keep lobbying for more money. \u201cWe can see this as the beginning of a negotiation,\u201d says Baruch Blumberg, a Nobel laureate and former director of the NASA Astrobiology Institute. \n                     US space scientists rage over axed projects \n                   \n                     Physics wins the US budget race \n                   \n                     Astrobiology at NASA \n                   \n                     NASA's science mission directorate \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

The maximum allowable limit of fluoride in US drinking water is too high, according to a report from the National Academies' research unit this week. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) currently enforces a limit of 4 milligrams of fluoride per litre of water, and advises a lower limit of 2 mg/l for children younger than nine years for aesthetic reasons. But the Academy report says that these rules don't seem to be good enough. Children are drinking water in areas where fluoride is at about 4 mg/l, and some 10% of them have an ugly condition known as severe enamel fluorosis, where teeth are mottled brown and pitted. Most on the panel agreed that this affliction, which is found around the world, goes beyond the aesthetic and can be considered an \"adverse health effect\". The 450-page report also noted that there are some conflicting data on whether or not high levels of fluoride can be correlated with bone cancers. The EPA, which commissioned the Academy study, says it will now get down to the business of re-evaluating its maximum limit. At the moment, says report co-author Charles Poole, an epidemiologist at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, the United States's maximum limits are higher than that of many other countries.  \n              Not about fluoridation \n            The report only looked into high levels of fluoride, well above the 0.7-1.2 mg/l amount that is intentionally added to water in some communities to help prevent cavities. This practice, known as fluoridation, has long been a subject of controversy. The higher limits of 2-4 mg/l are usually only reached in areas where fluoride naturally leaks out from surrounding rocks into the water or where it is an industrial pollutant. \"We thought about calling our report 'Not About Fluoridation' and stamping NAF as a little acronym on every page,\" jokes Poole. Some vocal groups claim the risk to teeth and bones outweigh the benefits of fluoridation. This is contrasted by the majority of scientific opinion, says John Stamm, a dentist and epidemiologist at the University of North Carolina. \"Fluoridation is overwhelmingly supported by the dental profession and public health agencies,\" he says.  \n              Clear cut \n            The results in the report show that there seems to be a very clear cut-off point where fluoride no longer causes ill effects. Below 2 mg/l, severe enamel fluorosis is only seen very rarely. \"We are dealing with levels that look like they are not very far apart, but they are very different in terms of health effects,\" says Stamm. Such a clear line between harmless and harmful is unusual, notes Poole. \"In 30 years of environmental epidemiology, I have never seen a curve that so clearly showed a threshold,\" he says. \n             Visit our  \n             \n                 newsblog \n               \n              to read and post comments about this story. \n           \n                   British Dental Journal \n                 \n                   NAS report on fluoride \n                 \n                   Anti-fluoridation group Fluoride Action Network \n                 Reprints and Permissions"},

On Friday 24 March, researchers at the Georg August University of G\u00f6ttingen in Germany announced they had found a source of reprogrammable cells in the testes of adult mice. By Sunday morning, more than ten companies had e-mailed senior team member Gerd Hasenfuss about collaborating on future work. Hasenfuss, a cardiologist, admits that much work must be done before the discovery could lead to any applications in humans. But the finding drew attention immediately: it promises, at least for men, a simple and uncontroversial method for harvesting therapeutic stem cells. Two other research groups have made similar claims in the past, and a patent showdown among the three is looming. As Hasenfuss's team reports in  Nature , the reprogrammable cells come from sperm-producing stem cells in mice (K. Guan  et al .  Nature    200610.1038/nature04697 ). It is not clear whether the cells in the testes have the ability to produce all other kinds of bodily cells, as embryonic stem cells can. But after the team extracted, cultured and multiplied the cells 700-fold, they converted to an embryo-like state in 4 out of 15 cases. When injected into early embryos, the converted cells helped build various organs of the resulting mouse. And,  in vitro , the converted cells turned into several different types of cell, including heart, brain and skin cells. Hoping to move the work into humans, the team has already received tissue samples from testicular-cancer patients. Hasenfuss thinks that, eventually, a simple biopsy could extract the necessary cells. Such cells would be a genetic match with the patient, which makes them less likely to be rejected if used in therapy. But Hasenfuss's work has its sceptics, including Takashi Shinohara, a mouse germ-cell expert at Japan's Kyoto University. Shinohara's group was the first to isolate reprogrammable cells from mouse testes, but it used two-day-old pups (M. Kanatsu-Shinohara  et al .  Cell   119,  1001\u20131012; 2004). His experience differs from that of the G\u00f6ttingen researchers in some ways \u2014 for example, they report that stem cells injected into embryos are able to integrate into various tissues. \u201cPerhaps they have some different kind,\u201d he says, \u201cbut I don't think that type of cell exists.\u201d Shinohara also points out that many researchers have tried doing similar experiments, with more sophisticated culture media, without the same results. \u201cIt's too good to be true,\u201d he says. Kaomei Guan, of the G\u00f6ttingen team, counters that simplicity may be the key. Applying a complicated mix of certain growth factors in a lab dish for a long period of time, he says, can cause other cells to take over and the sperm stem cells to die. A third, US-based group has already claimed some success in related experiments with human cells. Francisco Silva is vice-president of research at PrimeGen Biotech, based in Irvine, California. He says that, working with samples from 22 testes, the company \u201chas successfully therapeutically reprogrammed human germ cells and differentiated them to multiple cell types  in vitro \u201d. Silva has presented the data at scientific meetings, and says he plans to submit results for publication soon. But Shinohara is again sceptical. Hasenfuss, Shinohara and PrimeGen all say they have filed for international patents on their technologies. Some legal squabbles are likely. Hasenfuss, for example, claims work in adult mice is different from that in neonatal mice. Shinohara says the two experiments are essentially the same. Whether any of the mouse-based claims would cover humans is not clear. Even if a patent office grants a patent, it may be invalidated by the courts, says Lynn Pasahow, an intellectual-property attorney with Fenwick & West in Mountain View, California (see \u2018US to rule on research patent\u2019). \u201cIt may be difficult to know the scope of the valid claims,\u201d he says. In any case, researchers still have to show that the cells can be derived, grown and manipulated just like those from the alternative source, cloned embryos. In theory, the reprogrammable testes cells could circumvent the ethical difficulties of stem-cell work that involves destroying human embryos. \u201cThis could put the embryonic stem-cell people out of business,\u201d says Peter Donovan, a stem-cell expert at the University of California, Irvine. \u201cBut it remains to be seen whether they work in humans.\u201d \n                     'Ethical' routes to stem cells highlight political divide \n                   \n                     Rebooted cells tackle ethical concerns \n                   \n                     Stem cells in focus \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

San Diego A US trial of an experimental blood substitute given to trauma patients who cannot give consent is stirring concern about the way that such \u2018no consent\u2019 trials are run. It is rare for experimental treatments to be given without consent. In the United States, for example, the practice was authorized in limited circumstances only a decade ago. But such trials are set to increase under an initiative to test treatments for trauma and heart-attack victims. Advocates say that the tests are the only way to gather critical information in emergency situations \u2014 but critics argue that patients' rights are not being sufficiently protected. In the blood-substitute study, communities are supposed to be educated about the programme in lieu of each individual giving prior consent. But ethicists worry that, in at least some of the areas involved, consultation has been inadequate and there is little public knowledge about the risks, and how to avoid taking part. Initiated in 2003, the study seeks to enrol 720 patients as they are rushed to 32 hospitals nationwide, with about 600 people having been enrolled so far. The oxygen-carrying blood substitute, called PolyHeme, is made by Northfield Laboratories in Evanston, Illinois. It consists of treated haemoglobin from human blood, and is designed to replace the saline solution given by emergency workers to prevent shock from blood loss. Some ethicists are particularly concerned about blood transfusions being withheld from patients once they are hospitalized, to see how well the blood substitute works. \u201cI have a lot of problems\u201d with various aspects of the work, says attorney Nancy King of the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill. King is one of three medical ethicists who last week wrote an open letter criticizing the trial's construction to the  American Journal of Bioethics 1 . They are concerned that the trial conflates conditions in ambulances, where blood transfusions are not a feasible part of patient care, with conditions in hospitals, where they are. Northfield officials refused interview requests, directing enquiries to the company's website, which states that \u201cNorthfield is committed to conducting its study with the utmost concern for patient safety\u201d. Over the past year, ethicists have become increasingly vocal about various issues relating to the trial. One problem is that the product is often provided in poor communities with high proportions of ethnic minorities, as these can have higher numbers of trauma cases. The only way to opt out of receiving PolyHeme if injured in areas covered by the trial is to wear a particular blue wristband. But critics say there have been inadequate advertisements and education meetings, and interviews with members of the emergency services and community liaisons suggest that the level of awareness of the trial is very low. Another concern is a lack of information about the trial's results. The study is funded by Northfield, which pays the hospital $10,000 per enrolled patient, and the company doesn't want the details disclosed to protect its financial interests. In San Diego, one of the study sites, Northfield unsuccessfully sued the  Reader  newspaper in December to block disclosure of details of the study. The newspaper is itself suing the University of California, San Diego (UCSD), which has enrolled about 25 trauma patients, for information about what it believes are adverse study results. UCSD officials say they are protecting patient privacy and abiding by Northfield's contract. Northfield is also under fire for not promptly disclosing the results of a previous study that tested PolyHeme in patients with abdominal aortic aneurysms. On 22 February  The Wall Street Journal  reported that 10 of 81 patients suffered heart attacks \u2014 with two dying \u2014 after receiving PolyHeme. The study was halted in 2001. Tong Gan, a clinical researcher at Duke University in North Carolina, and other principal investigators on the study have argued for the full results to be published so that scientists can learn from them. Northfield says it did not delay publication and that PolyHeme wasn't responsible for the problems. But the results prompted at least four hospitals, including Albany Medical College in New York, to temporarily suspend the trauma study. Some have since restarted the trial. \u201cAny institution that continues this trial without additional consultation with communities is doing a profound disservice,\u201d says Glenn McGee, director of the Alden March Bioethics Institute at Albany. Michael Caligiuri, UCSD's director of clinical research programmes, counters that those involved with the trial are doing their best to deal with the ethical issues as they arise. \u201cThis is not a perfect system,\u201d he says. \u201cWe are learning a lot from the PolyHeme study.\u201d In the coming months, a National Institutes of Health (NIH) research project called the Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium (ROC) is likely to spur similar questions as it starts enrolling patients. This $50-million, five-year project at ten hospitals in the United States and Canada will test experimental techniques on trauma and heart-attack patients who cannot give prior consent. The first such study, of a high-salt saline solution for trauma patients, is set to begin later this year. Paediatric cardiologist Tracey Hoke, the NIH's medical officer for the ROC, insists that lessons from the PolyHeme trial will have been learned: \u201cWe intend to fully disclose risks and benefits to the communities.\u201d \n                     Northfield Laboratories Inc. \n                   \n                     IRB: ethics and human research article \n                   \n                     The Reader article on PolyHeme trial \n                   \n                     The Reader article on PolyHeme legal fight \n                   \n                     Alden March Bioethics Institute \n                   \n                     American Journal of Bioethics \n                   \n                     The American Journal of Bioethics article \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Jim Giles reports. On the arid plains that surround the Nile north of Khartoum in Sudan, a huge dam is slowly taking shape. The billion-dollar Merowe project will more than double the amount of electricity that Sudan can produce, and is just one of a dozen new dam projects being built across Africa using Chinese money and expertise. But scientists and environmentalists who have studied the dam say that poor local people will suffer because necessary precautions are not being taken. According to the first independent review of the dam plans, a copy of which has been seen by  Nature , inadequate thought has been given to the environmental and social consequences of flooding hundreds of square kilometres of land. That is far from unusual when it comes to Chinese investment in Africa, environmental groups allege. They say that China, which has a dire domestic environmental record, is repeating the mistakes of previous big dam projects, and that rural African communities will pay the price. \u201cChinese companies will ignore social and environmental impacts to the extent that local governments are willing to ignore them,\u201d says Thayer Scudder, an anthropologist at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, who has spent decades studying hydropower projects. \u201cIf governments don't care, or are corrupt, why will the Chinese engineers worry?\u201d The surge of large dam projects that began in the 1960s caused many lessons to be learned the hard way. Projects in China, India, North America and elsewhere caused serious downstream erosion through the removal of sediment, and the majority of resettled people suffered a decline in quality of life (see  \u2018Lessons to learn\u2019 ). Hydrologists say that thorough assessments of the impact, good design and well-funded resettlement programmes can minimize the impact of new dams. \n                     Damming evidence of human interference \n                   \n                     Water, water everywhere \n                   \n                     Merowe Dam \n                   \n                     International Rivers Network \n                   \n                     Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology (EAWAG) \n                   \n                     WWF report on hydropower in Africa \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

They analysed almost 200 public advertisements placed since 1984 in  The Times of India  by Indian Rare Earths, a mineral-extraction company that they suspect is helping to further the government's uranium-enrichment programme. Gas centrifuges are spinning canisters that can be used to produce uranium that is enriched in the fissile isotope uranium-235, for use in reactors or weapons. The technology is currently being pursued by nations such as Iran (see  Nature   432 , 432\u2013437; 2004). Not everyone is in agreement over how to respond to the ads. Arjun Makhijani, president of the non-profit Institute for Energy and Environmental Research based in Takoma Park, Maryland, points out that India never signed the treaty on the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons. So it is technically allowed to further its enrichment programme. \u201cIndia is not breaking any rules,\u201d he says. But Albright says the technically detailed descriptions being published in newspapers show India's lax control over its nuclear technology. \u201cIt's gotten ridiculous,\u201d he says. \u201cIndia just can't turn its back on this, and neither can the United States.\u201d CORRECTION (22 Mar 2006): the print edition of this article incorrectly referred to uranium-238 as the fissile isotope for use in reactors and nuclear weapons.

A drug trial that took a shocking turn in London last week may have far-reaching effects on policy. Its failure, experts say, could change restrictions on clinical research and increase scrutiny of the private companies that carry out the majority of clinical trials. \u201cThere's going to be a lot of soul searching,\u201d says Thomas Murray, a bioethicist at the Hastings Center, a think tank in Garrison, New York. As  Nature  went to press, two previously healthy young men were in critical condition and another four seriously ill at Northwick Park Hospital in London. On 13 March, they received intravenous injections of TGN1412, an antibody made by Boehringer Ingelheim for TeGenero, a small, privately owned biotechnology firm in W\u00fcrzburg, Germany. The drug was being developed to fight autoimmune diseases and leukaemia. Parexel International, a contract research organization based in Waltham, Massachusetts, that operates in 39 countries, was running the trial for TeGenero. \u201cWas informed consent adequate? Were the right subjects selected? Were the right doses given? This better have been done right, or some tough questions are going to come up for the private, commercialized research sector,\u201d says Arthur Caplan, a bioethicist at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia. Within one to two hours of being injected, the six volunteers suffered violent reactions that included headache, backache, nausea, a drop in blood pressure and, ultimately, multiple organ failure. The trial was the first test of the drug in humans; it was immediately suspended by the UK Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency, which is now investigating. Thomas Hanke, chief scientific officer for TeGenero, says that the company had \u201cno preclinical evidence whatsoever\u201d that the drug might be unsafe, and that no adverse effects had been observed in rabbit and monkey studies.

The decision by Dalibor Sames to withdraw two published papers 1 , 2  and part of a third 3  has drawn unwanted attention to the chemical field of C\u2013H functionalization. But the furore seems unlikely to dim the area's lustre. Sames says in his retraction 4  that his group at Columbia University in New York has been unable to reproduce the published results since graduate student and co-author Beng\u00fc Sezen left the lab.

Unfortunately, it is a serious headache to cut the strong bond between a particular hydrogen atom and the carbon to which it is attached and replace that hydrogen with something else: another carbon, say, or a phenyl group. Most techniques will indiscriminately break all such bonds in any given molecule. The work at the Sames lab and elsewhere aims to replace this blunt approach with something more delicate: employing reusable catalysts to fashion reactions targeted at specific bonds. Such selectivity would have practical applications in industrial processes to make pharmaceuticals or fuels. Chemist Robert Bergman at the University of California, Berkeley, is sanguine about the technique breaking out of the lab. \u201cIf you asked people ten years ago whether anyone would ever come up with a catalytic method to do this, they would have said no.

You probably wouldn't expect measuring the Universe to be easy. But turning data from the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) into a map of the Big Bang's afterglow has been an all-consuming task. \u201cWe just had to get this out to get on with our lives,\u201d says Lyman Page of Princeton University, New Jersey. Page and his colleagues have spent the past three years analysing the latest data from WMAP, a satellite launched in 2001 to study patterns in the radiation known as the cosmic microwave background. These patterns, which reflect the state of the Universe at the time the first atoms formed, hold clues to its structure, history and composition. The team's results, revealed on 16 March, broadly confirm its first conclusions \u2014 presented in 2003 after analysis of a single year of data. The 2003 data provided powerful support for the idea that the Universe was dominated by things not directly observable \u2014 dark matter and dark energy. To improve on these results, which were based on maps of temperature fluctuations, the team mapped the polarization of the microwaves. The temperature signals are tiny (between 30 and 70 millionths of a kelvin); the polarization signal is 100 times fainter still. To detect the polarization signal meant characterizing completely the noise in the instrument. \u201cAt times you just thought, oh my gosh, how are we ever going to get this right?\u201d says Gary Hinshaw, who coordinated the analysis. For example, an amplifier on the satellite introduces complex noise into the data by contaminating each observation with a lingering trace of its previous measurement. The team had to find a way to correct for this across the 3 million pixels of the full-sky map. Often, they would try an approach only to find that it introduced new artefacts. \u201cIt was just gruesome detail day after day,\u201d says Charles Bennett, WMAP's principal investigator. From the polarization maps, the team precisely calculated the Universe's \u2018optical depth\u2019, one of the six fundamental properties of the cosmos. This allowed it to estimate that the first stars formed 400 million years after the Big Bang. It calculated another basic property, know as the inflation parameter, to be 0.95 with an uncertainty of less than 0.02. Theories of inflation, which hold that the Universe had a dramatic growth spurt in its first moments, predict that the inflation parameter should not be equal to one. The results, submitted to  The Astrophysical Journal , were released four days before the WMAP team was due to submit a request for further funding to NASA.

Washington DC It is a case that questions the very nature of what can be patented. Before the US Supreme Court adjourns at the end of June, it may decide whether a patent based on a biological relationship between two substances can be issued. A verdict could have implications for many other US and worldwide patents. \u201cThe United States is often an incubator for these issues,\u201d says Francis Gurry, deputy director-general of the World Intellectual Property Organization in Geneva, Switzerland. \u201cThe world is watching with a great deal of interest.\u201d A natural phenomenon or a law of nature generally cannot be patented, but a process that takes advantage of that phenomenon or law can be. Lawyers have been battling over this rule in biotechnology cases since at least 1980, when the Supreme Court ruled that a newly discovered microbe capable of digesting petrol could be patented. That case opened the door for the biotechnology industry and ushered in patents for antibodies, microorganisms and cells. Some feel that it is now too easy to patent natural phenomena. \u201cThere might be some individuals who would like to close that door,\u201d says Nick Godici, a former US Patent and Trademark Office commissioner. The latest case \u2014 Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings (LabCorp) against Metabolite Laboratories \u2014 deals with the field of biomedical diagnostics. It stems from a patent-infringement case over a method for diagnosing vitamin B deficiencies. In 1990, Metabolite patented a diagnostic test, based on an assay that measures blood levels of homocysteine, an amino acid. High levels of homocysteine are correlated with low levels of vitamin B 12 . Physicians often order such tests because high homocysteine levels are also correlated with increased health risks such as heart attacks, stroke and birth defects. Metabolite licensed the test to LabCorp, a clinical testing company. LabCorp stopped using it in 1998 and replaced it with a similar test developed by another company. When LabCorp stopped paying royalties, Metabolite sued for patent infringement. LabCorp lost, was ordered to pay $7.8 million, and lost again on appeal. In the case heard by the Supreme Court on 21 March, LabCorp argued that Metabolite had patented a law of nature by asserting ownership of the relationship between homocysteine levels and vitamin B 12 . Under these circumstances, LabCorp said, physicians infringe the patent simply by thinking about the relationship when studying test results. Miguel Estrada, an attorney for Metabolite, told the court that the natural relationship is integral to the diagnostic step. Addressing the broader issue, he argued, could \u201cwreak havoc on the patent world\u201d. A corresponding European patent does not claim to cover the relationship between levels of homocysteine and vitamin B 12 , and is not currently being challenged, says Siobhan Yeats, a biotechnology director at the European Patent Office in Munich, Germany. The Supreme Court could now come to a verdict, pass the case back to the lower courts, or dismiss it altogether. One complication is that the biological-relationship argument was not addressed in the lower courts. And although no one can predict which way the vote will go, at least one justice indicated his thoughts during the hearing. Justice Stephen Breyer hinted that patenting a scientific phenomenon might limit researchers' motivations to search for new cures. \u201cIf you don't provide them with an incentive,\u201d he said, \u201cthey may think of less.\u201d \n                     Rumblings from the fringe \n                   \n                     Bad data fail to halt patents \n                   \n                     Models for facilitating access to patents on genetic inventions \n                   \n                     High-flying patents get their wings clipped in Europe \n                   \n                     US Supreme Court \n                   \n                     US Patent and Trademark Office \n                   \n                     European Patent Office \n                   \n                     World Intellectual Property Organization \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Japan is edging closer to launching its controversial nuclear-fuel recycling system; the first local approval for a power plant using recycled mixed-oxide fuel (MOX) looks almost certain. The Japanese government decided in 1997 to promote the use of MOX \u2014 a mix of plutonium and uranium produced by recycling spent nuclear fuel. But progress in adopting the fuel has been slow, due to a fatal accident at a nuclear power reactor, scandals involving falsified inspection data, and strong resistance from local people over safety concerns. But the first green light for using MOX, expected to come from the conservative government of Saga prefecture on the southern island of Kyushu, could speed the introduction of such plants around the nation. It could also help the government justify the nearly \u00a52 trillion (US$17.2 billion) it is spending on a fuel-recycling plant in Rokkasho village in the northern prefecture of Aomori. This is scheduled to go into operation next year. After a prefectural assembly signalled its approval last month, local officials are likely to endorse the plan to use MOX at one of four nuclear-power reactors in the town of Genkai before the assembly closes on 23 March. They will then make a formal agreement with a local power company, which is expected to be confirmed within the next few months. It is hoped that the plant will be operating by 2010, initially using MOX bought from France or Britain. The agreement will be a huge relief for the government, as recycling nuclear fuel is at the core of its long-term energy policy. Japan has few natural energy resources. And because it currently gets around a third of its energy from nuclear power, it also needs a way to get rid of the nuclear waste produced. The government wants to replace uranium with MOX at 16 to 18 of Japan's 52 nuclear power plants by 2010. Critics argue that the plutonium in recycled fuel would release more radiation than conventional fuel in the event of an accident, and would be a target for terrorists. \u201cSecurity measures at Japanese nuclear power plants are not nearly as great as they should be,\u201d says Edwin Lyman, a physicist at the Union of Concerned Scientists in Cambridge, Masssachusetts.

Researchers say that a remarkable data set on the developing brain adds to the idea that IQ is a meaningful concept in neuroscience. The study, which is published on  page 676  of this issue, suggests that performance in IQ tests is associated with changes in the brain during adolescence. Claims that IQ is a valid measure of intelligence tend to attract angry responses, in part because of studies that have attempted to link group differences in IQ with race. In their 1994 book  The Bell Curve , political scientist Charles Murray and psychologist Richard Herrnstein argued that the lower-income status of some US ethnic minorities was linked to below-average IQ scores among those groups. These were in turn attributed to mainly genetic factors. Before that, Harvard University entomologist Edward Wilson provoked outrage with work that proposed evolutionary explanations for human behaviour and individual differences in intelligence; critics called the work racist. And this month, the journal  Intelligence  printed an editorial note defending its policy regarding the publication of controversial papers. The note comes after a study linking IQ and skin colour (D. I. Templer and H. Arikawa  Intelligence   34,  121\u2013139; 2006), published online last November, prompted a string of complaints from scientists. Yet researchers studying IQ say the social climate is becoming more receptive to such studies, in part because it is now widely agreed that cognitive abilities are shaped by environmental factors as well as genetic ones. The latest result, from a team led by Philip Shaw at the National Institute of Mental Health in Bethesda, Maryland, adds to the debate by linking IQ with changes in the brain over time, rather than fixed attributes such as brain size. \u201cIt's not that brainy children have more grey matter,\u201d says Shaw. \u201cThe story of intelligence is in the trajectory of brain development.\u201d Shaw's team tracked a group of more than 300 children as they aged from 6 to 19, running them through a series of cognitive tests \u2014 IQ is determined by combining scores from tests of a range of verbal and non-verbal abilities. The team also measured the size of brain structures using magnetic resonance imaging at roughly two-year intervals: more than half the children had at least two scans, and around a third were scanned three or more times. When the researchers split the children into three groups according to their initial IQ scores, they noticed a characteristic pattern of changes in the brains of the group with the highest scores. The thickness of the cortex \u2014 the outer layer of the brain that controls high-level functions such as memory \u2014 started off thinner than that of the other groups, but rapidly gained depth until it was thicker than normal during the early teens. All three groups converged, with the children having cortexes of roughly equal thickness by age 19. The strongest effect was seen in the prefrontal cortex, which controls planning and reasoning. \u201cMy first impression was 'wow, this is amazing,\u201d says Jeremy Gray, a psychologist at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut. He notes that it is difficult to persuade children and parents to return for scans over a long period of time, so imaging studies are usually limited to tens, rather than hundreds, of subjects. Shaw's study raises questions that could prompt further research. His team did not look at what could be causing the changes in cortical thickness, for example; the group points out that several mechanisms \u2014 including the formation and elimination of connections between brain cells \u2014 could be responsible. Also unknown is how genetic and environmental factors contribute to the change. The study is likely to prompt discussion of the possible social applications of such results, but these are limited. The trend identified by Shaw was significant when results from all the subjects were combined, but would probably be too small to predict how an individual child is likely to fare in school, for example. There are also likely to be queries about whether the research should have been conducted in the first place. IQ is a good predictor of performance at school and in the workplace. For some neuroscientists, this makes the physiological factors that contribute to IQ worth studying, in order to probe how intelligence works. \u201cThere's good evidence from functional imaging studies that very demanding tasks activate the prefrontal cortex, and that activity correlates with IQ,\u201d says Shaw. \u201cWe're getting at some common processing resource.\u201d Gray also points out that metrics related to IQ can help predict speed of recovery from stroke, so studying them could lead to new therapies. But for many others, the concept of linking IQ and intellect remains socially dangerous and scientifically dubious. Steven Rose, a neuroscientist at the Open University in Milton Keynes, UK, says performance on cognitive tasks depends on a large range of factors, from emotive state to recall ability, and that the \u201cIQ approach ignores all of these\u201d. He adds that even as a predictor of ability in school it has traditionally been put to negative ends \u2014 to weed out, rather than help, less able children. \u201cWe shouldn't go back to measures developed in the 1900s,\u201d he says. \n                     Intelligence: A gender bender \n                   \n                     Grey matter matters for intellect \n                   \n                     Memory miscalculation foils IQ \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Reports by Rusi Taleyarkhan that he had achieved table-top fusion in collapsing bubbles caused a storm when they were published in 2002 (R. P. Taleyarkhan  et al .  Science   295,  1868\u20131873; 2002). Taleyarkhan, a nuclear engineer now based at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana, used sound waves to cause the formation and collapse of bubbles within a liquid. The conditions inside the collapsing bubbles are theoretically extreme enough to allow nuclear fusion to take place. Taleyarkhan claims to have achieved this \u2014 an effect that, if real, could one day provide an almost limitless source of energy. Four years later, Taleyarkhan's work retains an almost magical ability to grab the headlines, most recently in January, when his latest results (R. P. Taleyarkhan  et al .  Phys. Rev. Lett.   96,  034301; 2006) were promoted in a press release by the American Physical Society. Millions of dollars are being spent trying to repeat the work, including $800,000 from the US Department of Defense. But corroboration remains elusive. Now, an investigation into the circumstances surrounding Taleyarkhan's experiments is throwing up serious questions about the validity of the work. Interviews with researchers who have worked closely with Taleyarkhan at Purdue reveal concerns about his actions since he arrived there full-time in 2004. The steps he has taken, they say, include claiming he obtained positive results from equipment on which they had seen only negative data, and removing the equipment from their lab altogether. And physicist Brian Naranjo of the University of California, Los Angeles, has completed an analysis that he plans to post later this week on arXiv. It suggests that the spectrum reported in Taleyarkhan's latest paper as proof of nuclear fusion came instead from the radioactive decay of a standard lab material. Taleyarkhan has declined to comment on events at Purdue, or on Naranjo's analysis, and he vigorously affirms that his results are valid and the effect is real. But the overall message from people close to this work is that there is little hope this particular approach will yield a viable fusion energy source. \n                 For the full investigation please see\u00a0\u2192  \n                 \n                     http://www.nature.com/news/bubblefusion \n                   \n               \n                     Desktop fusion is back on the table \n                   \n                     Collapsing bubbles have hot plasma core \n                   \n                     Physics: Far from the frontier \n                   \n                     US review rekindles cold fusion debate \n                   \n                     Nuclear flash in a pan \n                   \n                     Table-top nuclear fusion \n                   \n                     Special report - Bubble fusion: silencing the hype \n                   \n                     Warm fusion \n                   \n                     Introduction to sonoluminescence \n                   \n                     Rejected bubble fusion patent \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Felines are fast becoming a new focus for fears over avian flu, as cats infected with the deadly H5N1 strain are reported in Austria, Germany, Thailand and Indonesia. So could they spread the virus? The World Health Organization (WHO) has played down the danger based on current knowledge, but experts warn that the science is moving rapidly. The Austrian authorities announced on 6 March that three domestic cats had tested positive for H5N1 in the southern town of Graz, the scene of a recent outbreak in birds. That followed detection of the virus in a dead cat on the northern island of R\u00fcgen, Germany, on 28 February, and news that 8 of 111 apparently healthy cats tested close to bird flu outbreaks in central Thailand carried antibodies to the virus (see  Nature   439 , 773; 200610.1038/439773a ). In a statement last week, the WHO maintained a careful but reassuring tone: \u201cThere is no present evidence that domestic cats play a role in the transmission cycle of H5N1 viruses. To date, no human case has been linked to exposure to a diseased cat.\u201d That is all true, for now. In February 2004, the WHO reported the first outbreak in domestic cats. H5N1 was found in two of three cats tested from a household of 15 cats (of which 14 died) in Nakornpathom, Indonesia. At the time the WHO argued that cats are not naturally susceptible to flu, and that even if infected they would not shed large quantities of virus. But with bird flu it may be different. Later in 2004, Albert Osterhaus's team from Erasmus University in Rotterdam showed experimentally that domestic cats do die from H5N1 and do transmit it to other cats (T. Kuiken  et al .  Science   306,  241; 2004). And in January this year, the virus was found not only in sputum but also in faeces of experimentally infected cats, suggesting that infected animals may shed the virus extensively (G. F. Rimmelzwaan  et al .  Am. J. Pathol.   168,  176\u2013183; 2006). It is unclear how these findings relate to cats in their natural environment. But in next month's issue of  Emerging Infectious Diseases , Thai researchers describe a cat that died of H5N1 after eating a pigeon carcass. It showed similar pathology to cats experimentally infected with the virus. Meanwhile, Andrew Jeremijenko, head of influenza surveillance at the US Naval Medical Research Unit 2 in Jakarta, Indonesia, detected H5N1 in a kitten he found near a poultry outbreak in Cipedang, West Java, and tested out of curiosity on 22 January. The virus from the kitten is closely related to recent H5N1 strains isolated from humans in Indonesia: it shares genetic changes found in human strains that are not present in samples from birds. But scientists may just be learning what is already common knowledge among Indonesian villagers. Peter Roeder, a consultant for the UN Food and Agriculture Organization, says locals have an onomatopoeic name for bird flu \u201cthat sounds like \u2018plop\u2019, the sound of a chicken hitting the ground when it falls out of a tree. They also have a name for the cat form of avian flu \u2014 \u2018aaargh plop\u2019 \u2014 because cats make a screaming noise before they fall out of the tree.\u201d \n                     Bird flu kills German cat \n                   \n                     Thai dogs carry bird-flu virus, but will they spread it? \n                   \n                     Avian Flu web focus \n                   \n                     Bird Flu in focus \n                   \n                     Avian flu web resources on Connotea \n                   \n                     FAO avian flu site \n                   \n                     WHO avian flu site \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

British family doctors have started recruiting subjects for an ambitious effort to probe the interplay of genetic and environmental factors that cause disease. Researchers hope that half a million people will donate blood and urine samples, and give access to their medical records, as part of UK Biobank. This \u00a361-million (US$105-million) project launched on 13 March, funded by the Medical Research Council and the Wellcome Trust. Critics question whether it will give value for money. But the project's organizers say it has enormous research potential. Participants will be weighed and measured, and answer questions on topics such as alcohol intake and family medical history. Details will be held in a database and linked to records collected by the National Health Service (NHS). Thousands of cases of conditions such as heart disease and cancer are likely to develop, and researchers will be able to search the database for underlying genes and lifestyle choices. Critics, including members of the House of Commons Select Committee on Science and Technology, say health records alone can be a poor guide to the conditions a person suffers from. Medical journals have asked whether enough cases of disease will develop for results to be statistically meaningful. In contrast to some other genetic-database projects, however, critics are not concerned about data-privacy and ethical issues. UK Biobank's chief executive, Rory Collins, an epidemiologist at the University of Oxford, says complaints stem in part from a misunderstanding of the scheme. It might make sense to study the families of ill people if disease genes were the main target, he says, but they are not. \u201cThe primary use will be to compare people who develop disease with those that don't,\u201d he says. Researchers will then be able to examine the lifestyle and genetic factors that differentiate the two groups. Collins estimates that scientists will want to start mining the database in about ten years, when several thousand cases of diseases will have emerged. He adds that changes in the NHS computer system should have made it easier for scientists to use for research by then. Access will be controlled by UK Biobank, which will vet applications and coordinate groups to minimize the cost of accessing samples. These will be frozen and split between two locations, to provide a back-up. The UK project will be tracked in countries with similar schemes. Canada, Iceland and Japan have set up smaller biobanks.

Alison Abbott reports. Last autumn, Romano Prodi, a candidate for Italian prime minister, proposed a thought experiment to a group of top scientists. \u201cIf you had an additional \u20ac400 million (US$480 million) a year for five years to rescue Italian research, to be allocated during the first 100 days of government, what would you do with it?\u201d he asked. Prodi had summoned 20 or so scientists to his  Fabbrica , a think-tank housed in Bologna where he has been developing his government platform. The short answer came fast: \u201cWe would double the number of researchers.\u201d Italy's research force is currently half the size of comparably large, rich countries. The longer answer comprised a ten-page document published last December, which lists the many problems with Italy's underperforming research sector, and how they might be tackled. The bottom line: too much bureaucratic incompetence and an unreasonable demand for immediate returns, as well as too little money and meritocracy. The conclusions won't surprise most Italian scientists. \u201cPhysicists have developed a theory for chaos, but Italy is now running an experiment in chaos,\u201d comments Carlo Rubbia, a 1984 physics Nobel laureate and, until last year, president of the Italian energy and environmental agency ENEA. But the document proposes how to bring order. Its concerns and recommendations are now feeding back into detailed action plans for a government science programme that can be agreed by all nine parties of Prodi's centre-left Olive Tree coalition. Mathematician Luciano Modica is a former head of the Conference of Italian University Rectors (an association of university chiefs), and now a member of Prodi's union. He says, for example, that the document's proposal for an independent authority to evaluate research done in all publicly funded research institutes and universities is now a central concept in the proposed government programme. \u201cIt would eliminate the unfair and inefficient elements in the Italian academic system,\u201d he says. The scientists summoned by Prodi, none of whom is affiliated to a political party, argue that the problems have been there for decades, but have worsened in the past four years of Silvio Berlusconi's rule. The government has reduced Italy's scarce science funds for basic research, they say, and oriented the sector to applied research. Berlusconi's centre-right coalition has not issued formal statements about science in the run up to the elections next month, but sources close to Berlusconi indicate a continuation of this philosophy. \n               Uphill struggle \n             \u201cThe situation wasn't good before, but the Berlusconi government made it much worse,\u201d says Giorgio Parisi, a theoretical physicist at the University of Rome, \u2018La Sapienza\u2019. \u201cPerhaps the worst thing that has happened has been damage to the research agencies,\u201d adds Massimo Inguscio, an atomic physicist at the University of Florence. He says a series of much needed but failed reorganization attempts over the past decade have left agencies like the National Research Council (CNR) and the National Institute for the Physics of Matter with unclear sets of rules, imposing a culture of extreme uncertainty, \u201cwhich is not supportive of free research\u201d. Others have openly criticized Berlusconi's set of politically appointed agency heads as scientific lightweights, who lack the charisma needed to defend the Italian tradition of research (see  \u2018Careless with the truth\u2019 ). \n                     https://doi.org/10.1038/422467a \n                   \n                     https://doi.org/10.1038/421465b \n                   \n                     https://doi.org/10.1038/35085639 \n                   \n                     The National Research Council (CNR)  \n                   \n                     Committee for evaluation of Research (CIVR) \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Astrobiologists have welcomed the news that Saturn's small moon Enceladus has a huge geyser that spews water vapour and dust thousands of kilometres into space. It means the satellite may be hiding one of the most accessible reservoirs of liquid water in the Solar System. Evidence for the geyser was discovered by NASA's Cassini probe during three fly-bys in 2005. \u201cCassini essentially flew through it,\u201d says planetary scientist Jonathan Lunine of the University of Arizona, Tucson. According to a suite of papers in last week's Science (see  Science   311,  1388; 2006), the plume, which also contains carbon dioxide, methane, nitrogen and propane, is probably fed by a reservoir of liquid water that nestles just beneath the icy surface. The idea that material could be welling up beneath the surface of Enceladus isn't new. When the Voyager probes flew past in 1980 and 1981, they spotted a flat area around the south pole that looked as though it had recently been resurfaced by volcanic activity; there was no sign of craters left by meteorite impacts, suggesting they had been wiped away. Astronomers also speculated from Voyager data that Saturn's E ring of fine particles was being fed by material from Enceladus. The latest observations support that idea, and suggest that the geyser could in part be driven by heat from the movement of Enceladus' insides, which slosh around as the moon is pulled back and forth by its neighbours' gravity. Heating from the decay of radioactive elements also contributes to the process. The Cassini team estimates that at least 150 kilograms of material a second comes from the plume, which is more than enough to supply Saturn's E ring. But the probe did not find any ammonia \u2014 previously suggested as the antifreeze that helps keep internal water liquid in this chilly part of the Solar System. So parts of Enceladus may be much warmer than anyone expected, a possibility that has excited astrobiologists. \u201cWe have found another environment in our Solar System, in a very surprising place, that could host living organisms,\u201d says Caroline Porco of the Space Science Institute in Boulder, Colorado, who leads Cassini's imaging team. That makes Enceladus an attractive place to explore, says Lunine. The ice-covered oceans of Jupiter's large moon Europa remains the main target of astrobiologists' interest. But its frozen crust may be kilometres thick. \u201cWhat's different here is that pockets of liquid water may be no more than tens of metres below the surface,\u201d says Andrew Ingersoll, an atmospheric scientist at the California Institute of Technology, Pasadena. Cassini's next close fly-by in spring 2008 should help to find out for sure. \n                     Enceladus gets active \n                   \n                     Atmosphere found on Enceladus \n                   \n                     Titanic complexity pleases planet scientists \n                   \n                     Cassini special \n                   \n                     Destination: Titan special \n                   \n                     NASA Cassini-Huygens homepage \n                   \n                     ESA Cassini-Huygens homepage \n                   \n                     Science \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Washington DC The number of commercial products advertised as containing nanoparticles is increasing rapidly, according to a new inventory. Environmental groups say the list shows that not enough is being done to oversee nanotech's spread into the commercial sphere. But others say that marketing, not a rise in use of the technology, may be driving the trend. The inventory of nanogoods was released on 10 March by the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, a think tank based in Washington DC that works on nanotech issues. Cataloguing every nanotech product that exists would be close to impossible \u2014 there are no regulations that require companies to register such products. So for a rough estimate of how much nanotech is out there, Andrew Maynard and his colleagues at the centre scanned the web for products that openly advertise the use of nanotechnology. Maynard and his co-workers found 212 products that use nanotechnology. This is double the number found by a similar survey carried out last year by EmTech Research, a pro-industry research group based in Ann Arbor, Michigan. Nearly half of these products were creams, cosmetics and supplements, designed to be applied to the skin or taken orally. That is evidence of the industry's growing commercial success, says Francine Porter, president of Denver-based Osmotics Cosmeceuticals. Her company markets an anti-cellulite cream called Lipoduction, describing \u201cNano Technology that increases delivery up to 700% over traditional cellulite products.\u201d Porter says sales have been brisk. \u201cThis industry is just exploding with nanotechnology,\u201d she says. Environmental campaigners, who have long voiced fears about the health and environmental implications of nanotechnology, say the figures highlight a worrying lack of regulation. \u201cIf the numbers are to be trusted, it says to me that potential exposure to nanomaterials would appear to be growing quicker than expected,\u201d says Douglas Parr, a physical chemist and chief scientist for Greenpeace UK in London. But others say much of the apparent surge in the use of nanotechnology may be the result of companies relabelling their goods to meet consumer preferences. For example, most cosmetic creams already contain nanoscale particles to penetrate the skin, so companies could use this in their marketing. \u201cNon-scientists tend to think there is something magic about nano.\u201d says J\u00f6ns Hilborn, a chemist at Uppsala University in Sweden and former president of the European Tissue Engineering Society.

A material has been made that turns cold at the push of a button, a feature that could be harnessed by novel cooling systems for computers. Alex Mischenko of the University of Cambridge, UK, and his colleagues say that their material may open the way to practical applications of 'electrical refrigeration', in which electric fields are used to keep things cool. This principle, called the electrocaloric effect, has been known since the 1960s, but it had seemed too weak an effect to be of much use. The Cambridge team has now found a ceramic material that shows what they call a giant electrocaloric effect; it's more than 100 times larger that seen previously. The material is actually a variant of a well-known one, called lead zirconate titanate, or PZT. This hard, crystalline solid is piezoelectric: squeezing it creates an electric field inside it. This makes PZT useful for inter-converting sound and electrical energy, as is done in some microphone and ultrasound technologies.  \n              Phase change \n            Mischenko and colleagues found that they could turn PZT into a promising electrocaloric material simply by making it from about 20 times more zirconium than titanium, they report in  Science 1 1 . The electrocaloric effect isn't very well understood, the researchers say. But Mischenko's colleague Neil Mathur at Cambridge explains that basically what is needed is a material that undergoes an abrupt change of its crystal structure, a so-called phase change, at a particular temperature. In PZT the temperature of this phase change can be altered by an electric field. This means that, close to the phase change, an electric field can pull the atoms in the crystal lattice into a low-energy state, allowing them to \"suck energy\" into the lattice and thereby to produce cooling.  \n              Electric cooling \n            The electrocaloric effect is very closely related to the better-known pyroelectric effect, in which warming a material creates an electric field. PZT has this property too, which is why the researchers chose to investigate it. \"Whatever is good for the pyroelectric effect is good for the electrocaloric effect,\" says Mathur. They found that by applying 25 volts to a film of zirconium-rich PZT a third of a micrometre thick, they could reduce its temperature by 12 oC. This effect could be used to make a heat pump for refrigeration, Mathur says. The idea would be to repeatedly cycle the material through the temperature drop, each time connecting it up to the system that is to be cooled and then disconnecting it again once it had cooled the system down. On each cycle, the temperature of the system would drop in a stepwise fashion.  The PZT material isn't going to be very useful in itself, Mathur admits, because the strongest electrocaloric effect happens only at relatively high temperatures: around 220 oC. He and his team are now looking for alternatives that work well closer to room temperature. Mathur points out that a related effect, in which cooling is induced by magnetism, has been used already by several companies to make prototype refrigeration units. But these require impractically strong magnetic fields. Could electrical triggering of the cooling be more practical? \"We can't say it will and we can't say it won't,\" Mathur confesses. \n                   Science \n                 \n                   Mathur lab \n                 Reprints and Permissions"},

Ukraine's \u2018orange revolution\u2019 \u2014 a national protest against corruption that overthrew the first results of the country's 2004 election \u2014 raised hopes for political and societal change. But more than a year on, scientists are increasingly frustrated by the slow pace of reform of the country's Soviet-style research system, which they believe is being hampered by Ukraine's aged and anti-European scientific establishment. The nation, which has a population of 48 million and is Europe's second-largest country in terms of area, has a long tradition in science and hosts an extensive network of academic institutes and research facilities. But, as it did elsewhere in Eastern Europe, science declined dramatically after the collapse of communism in 1991, forcing thousands of researchers to leave the country. When Viktor Yushchenko came into power in January 2005, it was hoped that the pro-West president would encourage a fundamental reform of the science system. But critics say that the promised switch to less a authoritarian system has hardly begun. The focal point of criticism is the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine (NASU), which runs 174 institutes and employs around 28,000 researchers. The powerful academy, a relic of the Soviet science complex, dominates Ukrainian science. The average age of the academicians is about 71; the president, Boris Paton, an expert in electric welding and the son of the former president, is 85. The bulk of the academy's activities relate to mechanics, material sciences and physics \u2014 euphemisms, according to critics, for former military-oriented engineering institutes. And productivity is low. According to the Thomson Scientific (ISI) statistics, academy scientists publish around 1,500 papers a year \u2014 roughly one-third of the output of Britain's University of Manchester alone. But critics say the academy is not interested in carrying out an independent review of its scientific performance. There are also claims of widespread corruption. For example, an attempt to create closer ties between Ukraine and western European institutions by linking Ukraine to G\u00c9ANT, the high-speed European data communication network, was allegedly hindered by academy members demanding bribes. Another complaint is that the academy leaders, fearing competition and loss of influence, are blocking attempts to facilitate Ukraine's participation in research programmes funded by the European Union (EU), by deliberately holding back information and generally failing to cooperate with EU authorities. \u201cThe Academy is not interested in any reform whatsoever,\u201d says Aleksei Boyarski, a theoretical physicist at CERN, the European lab for particle physics in Geneva, Switzerland. \u201cNothing will change in Ukrainian science as long as this system exists.\u201d Ukrainian scientists are eligible for EU research money thanks to a 2002 association agreement with the European Commission's framework programme for research. But so far, only seven out of thousands of EU-funded projects include Ukrainian participants, says Vadym Yashenkov, deputy director of Ukraine's National Information Point for EU research. According to Yashenkov, this is partly because of the general weakness of Ukrainian science and industry, and the complicated application procedures that put off many scientists. But participation is also hindered because the academy fails to provide and disseminate relevant documents and information, says Oleh Napov, a science attach\u00e9 at the Ukrainian mission to the EU in Brussels, Belgium. For example, Napov has submitted a proposal for scientific reform to the Ukrainian research ministry. He says that when he asked the academy to outline its scientific priorities, he received only a list of the names and titles of all current academicians, and a letter stating that the academicians themselves were the academy's priorities. \u201cMaybe they have not asked us in a proper way,\u201d counters Yaroslav Yatskiv, director of the Main Astronomical Observatory in Kiev, and a member of the academy's presidium. The president, Paton, had not responded to queries when  Nature  went to press. Yatskiv says he is aware that corruption is a widespread problem within the academy. \u201cIt is true, unfortunately, that funding is not based on scientific merit,\u201d he says. But he adds that efforts to evaluate and possibly transform the academy are being considered. \n               Brain drain \n             Yatskiv has recently proposed the creation of a National Science Foundation that, like its US counterpart, would fund research on the sole basis of excellence judged by peer review. But Paton last year told a presidium meeting that the future role of the academy should be similar to that of the Siberian branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences, another relic of the Soviet science complex. \u201cI don't think this is a good idea,\u201d says Yatskiv. Resistance to the academy's backward-looking plans is growing, both inside and outside Ukraine. A 13-strong group of Ukrainian scientists, led by Boyarski, has suggested to the country's science ministry a detailed concept of domestic reform, including rigorous evaluation of all academy institutes, the creation of an international institute of advanced study in Kiev and of a number of centres of excellence supported by the EU. \u201cThings back home really need to improve substantially,\u201d says Alexej Verkhratsky, a Ukrainian-born neurophysiologist at the University of Manchester and a member of Boyarski's group. \u201cIf they don't, our best young people will soon have left for good. A considerable number of Ukrainian scientists working abroad (myself included) would come back if things were reorganized.\u201d \u201cWe have the same potential, scientifically and politically, as Poland or Hungary to become a genuine part of Europe,\u201d adds Oleg Krishtal, deputy director of the academy's Bogomoletz institute of physiology in Kiev. \u201cWhat we need is proper political stimulus. Clearly, the academy cannot repair itself as long as the old guard is keeping all the key positions.\u201d Christian Patermann, director for biotechnology, agriculture and food at the European commission's directorate general for research in Brussels, led an EU delegation to Ukraine last month. He says that the country's scientific potential in areas such as materials sciences, energy, space and organic farming is impressive and deserves European support. Patermannn is optimistic that the academy will not ultimately stand in the way of reform. \u201cThe Czech Republic, Hungary and the Baltic countries have all managed to reform their academies of science; sooner or later this will also happen in Ukraine.\u201d See also  page 128 . \n                     Homeward bound European Union \n                   \n                     Ukraine deluged by protests over plans for Danube delta \n                   \n                     Ukranian science: DIY, Kiev style \n                   \n                     Mission of Ukraine to European Communities \n                   \n                     Ukrainian National Academy of Sciences \n                   \n                     Bogomoletz Institute of Physiology \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

But can they force action where others have failed, asks Amanda Haag. Fire and brimstone are coming to the aid of US science, as evangelical scientists and their allies in the religious community embark on a battle against climate change. \u201cThe time has come...for destroying those who destroy the Earth,\u201d says Calvin DeWitt, a professor of environmental studies at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, quoting from the Scriptures. The Bible teaches stewardship of the planet, he says, which is partly why 86 prominent US evangelical Christians last month signed the \u2018Evangelical Climate Initiative\u2019 calling for mandatory limits on greenhouse-gas emissions. The movement began in 2000, when 50 evangelical scientists \u2014 including DeWitt \u2014 signed a statement calling for policy-makers to take steps towards reducing the threat of climate change. It is a rare move in the United States, where environmentalists and the religious community often find themselves in opposite camps. Climate activists hope the initiative will have the political clout to help sway President George W. Bush's administration towards mandatory emissions cuts. Bush has not signed up to the international Kyoto Protocol on regulating greenhouse gases. Instead, he is promoting clean-energy technologies through agreements such as the six-nation Asia\u2013Pacific partnership. Yet many of Bush's core supporters are religious conservatives. Evangelicals are a powerful social force in the United States, with the National Association of Evangelicals (NAE) boasting 30 million members. \u2018Evangelical\u2019 is an umbrella term encompassing more than 50 denominations whose members typically believe in Jesus Christ and that the Bible is the authoritative word of God. The NAE has not officially endorsed the climate initiative, but many of the organization's leaders believe it represents a growing consensus that climate change is a matter for concern. Climate researchers are watching the movement with optimism. Jim White, a University of Colorado geochemist who studies ice sheets in Greenland, says that it will almost certainly accelerate public support for action on climate change. \u201cTo have a group that has historically fought the notion come around \u2014 I think that does impact on the public's thinking,\u201d he says. And it is this public support that some believe could influence conservative legislators. Eileen Claussen, president of the Pew Center on Global Climate Change, based in Arlington, Virginia, says that the lack of significant public demand for action on climate has hampered acceptance by members of Congress. \u201cSo I think the evangelical initiative is welcomed by all,\u201d she adds. One reason many are hopeful about change is that certain key evangelicals \u2014 such as Ted Haggard, president of the NAE, and Richard Cizik, the group's vice-president of government affairs \u2014 speak regularly with the White House. \u201cThat's very significant,\u201d says DeWitt. \u201cI think the president really wants evangelicals to see him as evangelical.\u201d If Bush does not warm to the idea of mandatory emissions, DeWitt says, he could lose some of his key support. Backers of the initiative are now distributing the statement to Congress, hoping to educate legislators on their views. \u201cThey may be able to hear the message about climate change from us where they couldn't necessarily hear it and really listen to it from others,\u201d says Reverend Jim Ball, executive director of the Evangelical Environmental Network, which is championing the initiative. A positive development would be to bring together two bipartisan groups of senators \u2014 one led by John McCain (Republican, Arizona) and Joe Lieberman (Democrat, Connecticut), and the other by Pete Domenici (Republican, New Mexico) and Jeff Bingaman (Democrat, New Mexico) \u2014 who have separately put forward climate-change legislation. Domenici and Bingaman have scheduled an April congressional climate conference to discuss ways of mandating emissions cuts. The evangelicals say they realize they won't change minds overnight. \u201cWe're under no illusions that our statement, or its circulating, is going to break open the log jam,\u201d says Ball. In the meantime, the group is airing advertisements on major television networks. They next aim to build relationships within the business community, in part by planning for a November meeting between business leaders and evangelicals to help show that climate change can be tackled in ways that will not harm the economy. John Houghton, a leader in the Christian environmental movement (see  \u2018The man who preaches science\u2019 ), says the task is particularly hard in the United States. He lectures frequently to international audiences and says that, outside the United States, he rarely encounters resistance to the validity of climate-change science. But leaders of the initiative feel the science is now solid enough to convince even the unbelievers. \u201cIf there was not such an overwhelming scientific consensus, we probably wouldn't be able to get traction on this issue in our community,\u201d says Ball. \n                     Where theology matters \n                   \n                     Why science and religion need to talk \n                   \n                     Evangelical Climate Initiative \n                   \n                     Evangelical Environmental Network \n                   \n                     John Ray Initiative \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Sparks flew when a scientist and a renowned artist joined forces to argue that great Renaissance painters used lenses to create their masterpieces. Five years on, an even fiercer controversy burns, as one of them accuses his chief critic of misconduct. The travail began when painter David Hockney and optics scientist Charles Falco at the University of Arizona, Tucson, published a book and several articles laying out a remarkable theory. They argued that major European masters from the Renaissance to the nineteenth century had used lenses or mirrors to project images on to their canvases, to capture certain details of expression or perspective more accurately (see  Nature   412 , 860; 2001). In one line of evidence, Falco and Hockney used lenses to recreate particular scenes in paintings. They saw distortions that matched those present in the original pictures, for example in the octagonal pattern of a tapestry in Lorenzo Lotto's  Husband and Wife  (see above). Their work spawned an international circuit of conferences and widespread public interest. David Stork, optics expert and chief scientist at Ricoh Innovations in Menlo Park, emerged as the most vociferous and frequent critic, arguing that the masters didn't \u201ccheat\u201d. After a particularly acrimonious meeting in January 2005, Falco says he sat down to dissect the arguments in Stork's articles and lectures. He discovered what he claims are fabrications and manipulations that constitute misconduct. Stork \u201csystematically used erroneous data\u201d, Falco has written in letters of complaint. He adds that Stork's articles \u201care at significant variance with accepted standards of scientific publication\u201d. For instance, Stork has analysed the  Husband and Wife  scene too, and claims that Lotto did not use a lens. But part of his argument uses a photo of a carpet with an octagonal pattern, and Falco claims that Stork selected a photo of one with a distorted weave. When this warping is corrected, says Falco, the results support his own theory. Falco also alleges that Stork fabricated two of five data points relating to a Georges de la Tour painting of Christ. Stork told  Nature  he was shocked by the charges. \u201cI categorically deny any inappropriate inactivity,\u201d he says. \u201cThis is insane.\u201d Christopher Tyler, director of the Smith-Kettlewell Brain Imaging Center in San Francisco and co-author of Stork's Lotto analysis describes his role in the study as \u201clight\u201d, but says that he stands by the work. Several other experts contacted by  Nature  at Stork's request were unable to provide further information about Falco's allegations. In May, Falco sent details of his analysis and a letter requesting an investigation to the publishers of nine of Stork's articles, which mostly appeared in the proceedings of conferences where Stork had spoken. He also sent details to Stanford University in California. Stork has widely represented himself as associated with Stanford, using a university e-mail address and web page for his criticisms. But although Stork has taught occasional courses at Stanford, he is not now affiliated with the university. After eight months in which he got no significant response from Stanford or any of the publishers, Falco says he decided to publicly disclose the allegations. The decision was partly spurred by a recent review that Stork wrote for  Nature  in which, Falco alleges, his theory was mischaracterized again (see  Nature   438 , 916; 200510.1038/438916b  and  Nature   439 , 392; 200610.1038/439392b ). \u201cHe attacks Hockney's and my professional competence in press releases and in talks that he solicits for himself based on his erroneous publications,\u201d claims Falco. Editors of the International Society for Optical Engineering, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, the Optical Society of America, and the Society for Imaging Science and Technology are among those who have published Stork's articles. They say they have no plans to investigate the matter, a stance that Falco describes as \u201cdisappointing\u201d. But in November, Stanford removed Stork's web page and e-mail from its server. And Stork acknowledges that in December the university's research dean, Arthur Bienenstock, asked him not to represent himself as being at the university. Bienenstock has made no official comment about whether the university will investigate the claims, but Falco said last week that he is encouraged his allegations are being taken seriously. \n                     No clear evidence to disprove optics thesis \n                   \n                     Tracing the history of art \n                   \n                     Science in culture \n                   \n                     Science in culture \n                   \n                     Science in culture \n                   \n                     Artists on science: scientists on art web focus \n                   \n                     Charles Falco, University of Arizona \n                   \n                     David G.

Most of these athletes have already been cleared of any doping suspicions by further tests. But regardless the International Olympic Committee (IOC) argues that the suspensions were valid for health reasons: having too high a red blood cell count can potentially lead to dangerous clotting. A second major incident overshadowed the Games last weekend. In surprise raids by Italian police, syringes, unlabelled drugs and transfusion equipment was found in the Austrian ski team's quarters. The IOC hasn't yet released the results of blood tests on the team.  \n              Why would someone want a high red blood cell count? \n            Red blood cells contain hemoglobin, which carries oxygen around the body. A higher count of red blood cells leads to a better oxygen-supply to muscles, improving endurance, strength and speed.  \n              How high can the count be? \n            Normal haemoglobin levels are about 14-17 grams per deciliter of blood in men and 12-15 g/dL in women.  Different sports and competitions have different allowable limits. The International Ski Federation (FIS) accepts a maximum of 17 g/dL hemoglobin in men and 16 g/dL in women. The suspended athletes were all less than a gram above these limits  \n              How can you boost your count? \n            A high count, called polyglobulia, can be caused by a number of things. People living or training at high altitude show constantly raised hemoglobin-levels. As a reaction to the low oxygen supply, the kidneys produce more of a small hormone called 'erythropoietin' (EPO), a growth factor for the production of red blood cells in bone marrow. One study of people in the Andes showed natural levels as high as 21 g/dL. The same thing can happen when other conditions reduce oxygen supply to the organs, including chronic lung- and heart diseases or heavy smoking. A few rare, inheritable genetic disorders can lead to a high red blood cell count. But most of these are accompanied by symptoms that would preclude the person becoming an Olympic athlete. Simple dehydration can also make the blood thicker, indirectly raising red blood cell concentrations. Or it could be the result of blood doping.  \n              What's that? \n            Athletes can inject concentrated haemoglobin from themselves or another person using blood transfusion equipment, or take drugs such as synthetic EPO to raise their count. These activities are banned at the Olympics.  \n              Is it really dangerous to have a high count? \n            That depends heavily on the individual. Some athletes who have a naturally high count can get an exemption from the normal limits from the IOC.  There is an elevated risk of developing thrombosis from a high red blood cell count, particularly along with dehydration and stress, says Fernando Dimeo, doctor at the Department of Sports Medicine at the Berlin university hospital Charit\u00e9. \"Since you can not tell an athlete to train less, the best way of avoiding too concentrated blood is simply by drinking a lot,\" says Dimeo. Some coaches disagree with the IOC's strict limits. \"A hemoglobine value of 16.3 %, as Evi Sachenbacher showed for instance, you can by no means call dangerous,\" says Wilhelm Sch\u00e4nzer, professor and doping expert at the German Sport University in Cologne.  \n              Can you tell if someone has naturally high levels or has been cheating? \n            Tests for EPO were invented in the late nineties and have been used at the Olympics since the 2000 Summer Games in Sydney.  There is yet no way to tell whether someone transfused his own blood. A quick jump in red blood cell count from one week to the next looks suspicious, however. One potential approach that hasn't yet been put into use would be comparing the ratio of young blood cells to older ones: a transfusion would result in a higher proportion of adult cells.  \n              Are there other reasons why the athletes might have transfusion equipment? \n            It is allowed for athletes to inject certain complementary substances, including vitamins and electrolytes. And some athletes might be diabetic. But all drugs to be injected should be clearly labelled at an Olympic venue.  \n              What about gene doping? \n            This is expected to be the next frontier for athletes. Instead of using drugs or fresh blood to pump up the body's production of red blood cells, what if you could modify your genes to do it for you?   Repoxygen , a product of the british company  Oxford BioMedica  is one of the first products that could officially be classified as gene doping. It uses viral transmission of a vector bearing the human EPO-gene, and can make muscle cells start to produce EPO.  Repoxygen  was originally created for use by people whose kidneys don't function properly This drug is still in pre-clinical development and it is thought that no gene doping has yet occurred in sport. But experts say it is just a matter of time.

An application to market a drug made in the milk of genetically modified (GM) goats was turned down this week. The decision means that, despite more than a decade of work using GM animals to produce drugs, no products have yet been approved for use. GTC Biotherapeutics of Framingham, Massachusetts, has spent almost 15 years developing a herd of genetically modified goats whose milk contains a human anticoagulant called anti-thrombin. The company planned to market the drug under the name ATryn. But the London-based European Medicines Agency (EMEA) turned down their request on 23 February, saying the product hadn't been tested enough. \"It's important to stress that the grounds for refusal have nothing to do with the use of a transgenic animal,\" says Martin Harvey Allchurch, spokesman for the EMEA.  \n              Easy breeding \n            ATryn was designed for people lacking a working anti-thrombin gene, who can have an increased risk of blood clots. At the moment they are given blood-thinning drugs such as Warfarin, but this can raise the risk of bleeding to death during childbirth or surgery. At such times anti-thrombin itself is used, the only present source of which is human blood. GTC spokesman Tom Newberry says that goats' milk is an ideal place to make these proteins, because it can deliver large quantities relatively cheaply and reliably. Some therapeutic proteins are currently produced in bioreactors, huge brewing vats that typically contain cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells. But large, complex proteins such as anti-thrombin are difficult to make this way. And breeding goats is easier than building reactors. GTC added a copy of the human anti-thrombin gene to a goat gene that makes milk. The engineered DNA was injected into an embryo, and a goat herd built up by conventional breeding. \"Getting the protein into the milk is the easiest part,\" says Newberry. The difficult part is purifying the proteins and doing enough clinical trials, he adds.  \n              Trial, trial again \n            The difficult part is purifying the proteins and completing sufficient clinical trials, Newberry says.  The EMEA recommended that GTC test their drug on 12 patients undergoing surgery. But the company only presented evidence from five cases, which the EMEA says is too few. Newberry says that the drug also tested positively during nine childbirths, but that the EMEA excluded these from the surgical tally. The agency also pointed out that the marketed product would have an extra filtration step that was not included in the trials. Finally, they said that GTC had done too few studies to assess whether patients developed antibodies in response to ATryn. The company plans to appeal against the decision.  \n              Moo milk \n            Despite the setback, the next such application is just around the corner. Pharming, a biotech company based in Leiden, the Netherlands, is awaiting approval from the US Food and Drug Administration for an antibacterial agent called lactoferrin, which they produce in the milk of GM cows. Samir Singh, chief business officer with Pharming, believes the company will get a positive response by the end of this year. As human lactoferrin would be a 'nutriceutical' \u2014 a food additive intended to boost health \u2014 it has fewer hurdles to clear than a drug.

There used to be a drawback to Tony Kastropil's job. As a pilot for the robot submarines that monitor subsea drilling operations, he spent most of his time looking at murky underwater pictures of oil rigs. It was not an experience his friends and family had much interest in sharing. But they have started paying more attention to the images he captures. Along with around 50 other pilots of remotely operated vehicles (ROVs), he now videos the often bizarre marine life he sees when studying rigs, and e-mails the results to grateful scientists. Thanks to Kastropil and others working off four continents, several new species and behaviours have been identified. And interest from rig operators is growing. \u201cROV pilots see things I never get to see,\u201d says Ian Hudson, who coordinates the project from the National Oceanography Centre in Southampton, UK, pointing out that getting access to a ROV would normally cost tens of thousands of pounds per day. Hudson started the SERPENT project ( http://www.serpentproject.com ) in 2002, after a two-week trip he made to a BP rig produced enough data for three papers. Realizing that the research potential of industry ROVs was largely untapped, Hudson got rig, ROV and oil operators, and the United Kingdom's Natural Environmental Research Council (NERC) to sign up to his project. The industry partners fly scientists out to the rigs, and together with NERC have created three PhD studentships for young scientists to take advantage of the opportunity. \u201cThere are probably 1,000 ROVs working for oil and gas companies at any one time,\u201d says Hudson. \u201cThe potential to explore is huge.\u201d Some of the pilots have made significant finds since. Kastropil's team on the  Discoverer Deep Seas  in the Gulf of Mexico stumbled across the rarely seen dumbo-eared squid. Michael Vecchione, a marine biologist at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington DC, says videos of the creature sent to him through the SERPENT project helped him conclude that the animals belong to the Magnapinnidae family, adult specimens of which have never been collected or properly described. Hudson's personal favourite is a creature he dubs the \u2018murderous crab\u2019. Galatheid squat lobsters ( Munida sarsi ) live at depths of 200\u2013800 metres from Greenland to the Bay of Biscay. The lobsters were thought to scavenge fish remains from the sea floor. But in 2002, Hudson spotted one grabbing krill from the waters around it, before ripping off the animals' heads and devouring them. The project is now expanding into the Arctic circle \u2014 Hudson expects to finalize a deal this week with Norwegian oil company Statoil. As well as giving scientists access to five rigs in and around the Barents and Norwegian seas, the firm plans to contribute nearly \u00a3500,000 (US$867,000) over three years. Other industry partners, notably rig operator Transocean, supply a total of nearly \u00a3500,000 per year. For many of the pilots, such as Kastropil, the project has awakened a keen interest in marine biology. The dumbo-eared squid was a \u201conce in a lifetime\u201d sighting, he says. \u201cThe beauty as a pilot is that it gives you interesting stuff to relate to family and friends. I've taken videos to my daughter's school. They were astonished.\u201d Marine scientists have also praised the scheme. But some caution that it shouldn't be seen as a replacement for dedicated research vehicles. Chris Grech, deputy director of marine operations at the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute in Moss Landing, California, says it's a great opportunity. \u201cBut the research will be severely limited by the dive locations, which are defined by the drilling needs,\u201d he points out. \n                     Muddy microbes retrieved from the abyss \n                   \n                     Four-armed jellyfish found \n                   \n                     Robots in the deep \n                   \n                     SERPENT project \n                   \n                     Discoverer Deep Seas \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Washington, DC Just weeks after President George W. Bush vowed to wean the United States off oil and onto alternative energy sources, scientists and policy analysts are voicing concern that the research push is unlikely to yield the promised benefits. Their worries were highlighted last week by events at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) in Golden, Colorado, the Department of Energy's main research centre for energy sources such as solar, wind and ethanol. Just days after being laid off, 32 NREL staff were reinstated when it emerged that Bush was going to visit the lab during a tour to promote his focus on alternative energy. During his tour of the lab on 21 February, Bush blamed poor communication for the oversight. \u201cI recognize that there have been mixed signals when it comes to funding,\u201d Bush said. \u201cUnfortunately, there are sometimes decisions made, but as a result of the appropriations process, the money may not end up where it was supposed to have gone.\u201d Bush's \u2018advanced energy initiative\u2019 made its debut in his State of the Union address on 31 January, when he called for a 22% funding increase for research into alternative energy technology. But budget analysts looking at the president's 2007 budget request say the proposed increase is more cautious, with funds moved into some research areas and removed from others. For instance, there is more money for research on solar energy, with a rise of 79% to $148 million, and biomass, up 65% to $150 million. But funding for energy conservation is down 6.3% to $289 million, and the geothermal programme is axed altogether. \u201cThe wider your view, the less glamorous it looks,\u201d says Kei Koizumi, a budget analyst at the American Association for the Advancement of Science. \u201cIf you look just at biomass, it looks great. If you look at all renewables, it looks less great.\u201d Energy research, including work on fossil fuels, would decline overall under the president's budget, says Koizumi. He adds that there is no money set aside for later years for the energy initiative. Reaction elsewhere has been mixed. Solar enthusiasts are pleased with a budget increase for work on photovoltaic cells. Noah Kaye, spokesman for the Solar Energy Industries Association, called it \u201ca key victory for a growing high-tech industry in the United States\u201d, but went on to call for production incentives such as tax breaks. Proponents of wind energy sang the same tune, only with less enthusiasm. Their research boost is just 13% to $44 million. The president's call for increased funding got a mixed reception from environmentalists. The funds just aren't enough, they say, and are too focused on research. \u201cWe need other policies including technology incentives, or caps on emissions,\u201d says Andrew Aulisi, a senior associate at the Washington-based World Resources Institute. \u201cYou need lots of different policies to get a handle on the climate and energy crisis. Even within R&D, the numbers are not that good.\u201d To make matters worse, analysts point out that a large part of the increased money is likely to be taken up by earmarks, in which legislators appoint money to projects in their home states. For example, the NREL has blamed the lay-offs on the large number of earmarks in the 2006 budget, which it says left it with a $28-million deficit in operating costs. Earmarks are rare at agencies such as the National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation. But they made up 21% of the energy research and development budget last year, which is the highest ever, according to Koizumi. \u201cThe energy department has earmarks that they have no choice but to fund,\u201d adds George Douglas, a spokesman for the NREL. \u201cIt is taking away money that could be used in this type of research.\u201d Most scientists would favour peer review as a way of distributing the energy department's research funds, says Marchant Wentworth, legislative representative for clean energy at the Union of Concerned Scientists. \u201cIn the short term it does no good to have an on-again, off-again programme.\u201d \n                     Physics wins the US budget race \n                   \n                     High-energy career lines \n                   \n                     Energy: China's burning ambition \n                   \n                     Urban wind power: Breezing into town \n                   \n                     Sea change for tidal power \n                   \n                     Earth and environment news \n                   \n                     Climate change in focus \n                   \n                     National Renewable Energy Laboratory \n                   \n                     AAAS report on 2007 budget \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

A geometrical figure commonly attributed to Archimedes in 300 BC has been identified in Minoan wall paintings dated to over 1,000 years earlier. The mathematical features of the paintings suggest that the Minoans of the Late Bronze Age, around 1650 BC, had a much more advanced working knowledge of geometry than has previously been recognized, says computer scientist Constantin Papaodysseus of the National Technical University of Athens, Greece, and his colleagues. The paintings appear in a building that is still being excavated and restored in the ancient Minoan town of Akrotiri on the island of Thera. A catastrophic eruption of the volcano on Thera, now known as Santorini, around 1650 BC, is thought to have dealt a fatal blow to the Minoan culture. The blast covered Akrotiri, on the island's southern coast, in a thick layer of ash that preserved many buildings and artefacts.  \n              Unnatural design \n            Ten or so buildings have been excavated in Akrotiri so far, including a large one known as Xeste 3, which stands close to the ancient quay. Judging from its large size and extensive wall decorations, Xeste 3 appears to have been some kind of public building, such as a temple or a place for ritual ceremonies. The most impressive feature of the paintings found in Xeste 3 is a series of spirals, each about 32 centimetres in diameter and embellished with dots. Papaodysseus and his team have shown that these are near-perfect Archimedes' spirals: shapes tightly defined by a simple mathematical formula, in which the distance between the windings is constant. Some spirals, such as the ones found on snail shells, are common in nature. And others can be easily made by unwinding a thread around a central peg. But the Archimedes' spiral is not like either of these. \"Seemingly it does not exist in nature,\" the researchers say. \"This is the earliest time that such advanced geometric figures have been spotted,\" says Papaodysseus. \"The next such figures appear only 1,300 years later.\" The team report their work in the journal  Archaeometry 1 .  \n              A feeling for maths \n           Papaodysseus and his co-workers admit that they cannot know how much the Theran artists actually understood about the geometric principles they used for the paintings, because there aren't any known, translated documents on the subject. But he says that, at the very least, \"experimentation with geometric tools must lie behind the construction of these wall paintings, as well as an impressive feeling for geometry.\" Spiral designs in Xeste 3 were first noticed years ago by archaeologists working at the site. But Papaodysseus says that most people previously assumed that the shapes were painted freehand. His studies suggest that the curves are just too accurate for that: the edges deviate from their strict mathematical form by typically less than a third of a millimetre. Papaodysseus thinks that this precision was probably achieved by the use of stencils, which appear to have been broken up into six parts to make them easier to transport and the paintings easier to fit to a given space. The key question is how the stencil itself was made.  \n              Splitting a circle \n            The researchers point out one relatively simple way of constructing such a spiral, without knowing the precise mathematical formula for it. One could divide up a circle using a large number of radial lines with equal angles between them, and a large number of concentric circles. A series of dots moving out one radial line and one concentric circle at a time could be joined together into an Archimedes' spiral. But dividing a circle into more than a dozen equal sections is not a trivial task; try it yourself.  Papaodysseus and his colleagues find that the dots decorating the spirals seem to be positioned almost exactly on the radial lines of circles that are divided into 48 sections. The wall paintings don't in themselves prove that the Therans knew enough geometry to bisect angles. But it certainly looks that way, says Papaodysseus.

With avian flu spreading around the world at a frightening rate, scientists are welcoming an international proposal for state-of-the-art labs to monitor emerging diseases in developing countries. But they add that the bird-flu crisis has exposed glaring deficiencies that demand a radical rethink of the world's veterinary and disease-surveillance systems. Avian flu is now endemic across large parts of Asia, and in the past few weeks has exploded across Europe and into Africa. \u201cH5N1 has focused the spotlight of the world on disease surveillance, and it's showing up all the pimples and warts,\u201d says Bill Davenhall, who develops health mapping schemes for countries and is head of health at ESRI, a geographic information systems company in Redlands, California. Developing countries, in particular, lack decent human-disease surveillance, and animal monitoring is often virtually nonexistent, with few basic laboratory and epidemiological resources available. \u201cOn the ground in Indonesia, there is no systematic programme at all,\u201d says Peter Roeder, a field consultant with the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). \u201cIt's just a bloody mess.\u201d \n               Global danger \n             It is a problem that the developed world cannot ignore, because a disease that emerges in Bangkok or Jakarta could ultimately trigger a global disaster. So researchers at the US Department of Defense have suggested setting up a network of high-tech labs in developing countries to monitor cases of infectious disease (see  page 25 ). The labs would be modelled on the US network of infectious-disease labs, such as the naval research unit NAMRU-2 in Jakarta. But they would be funded by the international community to avoid the local distrust that has often hampered labs run by the US military. Such a network could vastly speed up and improve the diagnosis of viruses such as H5N1 when outbreaks occur, says Roeder. He points out that misdiagnosis of H5N1 as Newcastle disease in recent outbreaks in Nigeria and India led to long delays in control measures. Mark Savey, an epidemiologist who heads animal health at France's food-safety agency, also welcomes the proposal, but cautions against the \u201cmirage of technology\u201d in surveillance. \u201cYou don't need satellites, PCR and geographic information systems to fight outbreaks,\u201d he says. The labs' top priority should be building large teams of local staff, who are familiar with the region and its practices, he argues. \u201cIf you do not have that, then surveillance will stay in the Middle Ages.\u201d Savey recalls his trip to Russia last summer as part of a European team investigating outbreaks of avian flu. \u201cYou have a paper Michelin map; you have people who speak the language; you put red circles on outbreaks; and you use a pen and paper to compare them with things like the dates of market openings, and with how outbreaks line up with railways.\u201d Such local knowledge is crucial to interpreting data, he says. \u201cIf you don't know what the Trans-Siberian Express is like, with people cooped up for days, exchanging chickens and eggs at every stop, you would never guess that it was the Trans-Siberian that mainly spread avian flu across Russia.\u201d Roeder agrees that the focus must be local. \u201cNo amount of setting international guidelines and publishing global action plans is going to help when you have an organization within the country that doesn't know what to do,\u201d he says. \n               Back to basics \n             But many feel that alongside setting up local centres, epidemiology needs a fundamental overhaul. Even in developed countries, the field has been chronically underfunded, says Antoine Flahault, director of Sentinelles, France's national disease surveillance network. He adds that he is jealous of the multimillion-dollar satellites that climate scientists enjoy and the powerful accelerators being built for physicists. In comparison, epidemiologists \u201care still in the nineteenth century\u201d, he says. Flahault points out that his own national flu-monitoring system relies on a few hundred volunteer doctors submitting patient data to an online database. From these data, Flahault's team tries to build up a picture of disease across the country, spotting outbreaks and predicting when the year's flu season will hit. The 122-city programme run by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is the only one in the world where disease reports are made in real time, Flahault points out. And such lack of data prevents the field from developing sophisticated models of communicable disease. \u201cIt's as if we were trying to study the weather, but collected data only when there was a heatwave or storm,\u201d he says. Ward Hagemeijer, the bird-flu programme manager at Wetlands International in Wageningen, the Netherlands, also complains of the general lack of resources. He has been on recent missions to sample H5N1 in affected countries, but says he has been unable to get his African samples sequenced because certified labs have been too busy analysing samples from European outbreaks. \n               Leading light \n             Another fundamental problem is the lack of strong international leadership: there is no global body able to take overall responsibility for emerging diseases, particularly those that jump to humans from animals. The World Health Organization would be an obvious choice, but although it has a strong remit for public health, it is not responsible for monitoring outbreaks in animals \u2014 that duty belongs to the FAO and to the Paris-based World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE). Neither of those organizations traditionally monitors outbreaks from a public-health point of view, however \u2014 the FAO is concerned with food safety and the OIE is responsible for trade issues. \u201cVeterinary services throughout the world, particularly in developing countries, are very weak on this. They are not set up to watch for emerging disease events,\u201d says Roeder. As well as a lack of expertise, the FAO and OIE do not have the funds for disease surveillance. \u201cWe need much more day-to-day interaction with locals on the ground, but we haven't had the resources,\u201d Roeder admits. The situation is slowly improving, however. The FAO and OIE had set a target of $102.5 million for fighting flu in Asia, and by the end of 2005, countries had donated just $25 million. But, in January, donors at a Beijing conference pledged $1 billion in grants, and $900 million in loans to support the FAO/OIE Global Strategy for the Progressive Control of Highly Pathogenic Influenza. Many hope that resources pumped into avian flu will benefit the surveillance of emerging diseases generally by strengthening infrastructure. But the money available so far is only a start. And the rate at which new diseases appear \u2014 currently around one a year \u2014 is increasing. Mark Woolhouse, an epidemiologist at the University of Edinburgh, UK, has analysed all recognized human pathogens and he suggests that this rise is mainly due to changes in land use and the way that people live. Of the 117 emergent human diseases that he has studied, more than half jumped from animals. \u201cThe world has to get to grips with the fact that what is happening now is going to happen repeatedly,\u201d says Roeder. \u201cWe have to develop a global structure to tackle emerging diseases. \n                     Doubts hang over source of bird flu spread \n                   \n                     Bird flu reaches Africa \n                   \n                     Flu researchers slam US agency for hoarding data \n                   \n                     'Refusal to share' leaves agency struggling to monitor bird flu \n                   \n                     Bureaucracy stymies flu tactics \n                   \n                     Bird flu in focus \n                   \n                     Avian flu web focus \n                   \n                     US Global Emerging Infections System \n                   \n                     FAO avian flu site \n                   \n                     WHO avian flu site \n                   \n                     Web resources on avian flu epidemiology \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

The repercussions of Larry Summers's resignation as Harvard president are being felt both within and beyond the university's courtyards. His exit has cast a shadow on plans to promote science at the institution, and highlights the challenges faced by university leaders worldwide. Summers's announcement on 21 February that he will step down in June marked the climax of a year of intense criticism from academics unhappy with his brusque leadership and lack of consultation with faculty. Former Harvard president Derek Bok will stand in as interim leader until a new president is chosen. Summers's departure leaves some Harvard scientists in a state of disquiet. One of his central ambitions for the university was to develop the sciences, particularly interdisciplinary research, which he viewed as essential for Harvard to remain at the forefront of academia (see  Nature   433 , 190\u2013192; 2005). \u201cThere is a sense of unease,\u201d says David Scadden, co-director of the Harvard Stem Cell Institute, one of the projects championed by Summers. \u201cWe want the successor to share his sense of priority.\u201d One of Summers's boldest plans was to place science facilities at the core of a vast new campus to be built in Allston, Boston. Just days before his resignation, the university unveiled concrete plans for the first building on the Allston campus, a 46,450-square-metre complex that will house the Stem Cell Institute among other science initiatives. Steven Hyman, Harvard provost and top administrator, told  Nature  that expansion of science remains a main priority for the Harvard Corporation, the governing body responsible for selecting Summers's successor. \u201cThe university remains absolutely committed to a vision of building science at Harvard,\u201d he says. But because most details have yet to be thrashed out, some academics say Summers's departure provides an opportunity to reassess the plans, for example, which areas of research merit investment. \u201cThere are concerns about the direction to go and how fast to go,\u201d says physicist Gary Feldman, one of Summers's critics. \u201cWe need a careful and impartial assessment of Harvard's needs.\u201d With so much at stake, all eyes are on the selection process for the next president. Many faculty chafed at Summers's corporate management tactics \u2014 he previously served as US treasury secretary. The selection committee will therefore probably choose someone already senior at another university or from within Harvard, predicts William Funk of executive recruitment firm Korn/Ferry International, who helps universities find new presidents. \u201cI think this time they'll be very risk averse and choose someone steeped in academe with a proven track record,\u201d he says. Because of Harvard's position at the pinnacle of the US university system, Summers's resignation is attracting intense scrutiny from academics nationwide. They say Summers's run-ins with faculty reveal the difficulties faced by a modern university leader, who must increasingly spend time away from campus raising funds and liaising with the wider community. Although it is easy to develop sweeping plans, a good director must be able to sell them to faculty and staff, says Ingrid Moses, chancellor of the University of Canberra, Australia, and former president of the International Association of University Presidents. \u201cThey are the ones who are crucial for implementation,\u201d she says, \u201chence the importance of interpersonal skills.\u201d \n                     Unrest returns to confront Harvard president \n                   \n                     No-confidence vote fails to shift Harvard president \n                   \n                     Speech transcript stokes opposition to Harvard head \n                   \n                     The premier division \n                   \n                     Harvard University \n                   \n                     American Council on Education \n                   \n                     International Association of University Presidents \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

The rally was the first time that proponents of animal testing have come out en masse to support their cause. It happened in response to threats from animal liberationists who claim that anyone associated with the University of Oxford is a legitimate target for physical violence. The building of the Oxford lab has been hampered by persistent threats from animal-rights extremists. The project has been the target of regular protests by antivivisection campaigners, but previously only a handful of researchers had raised their voices to support the lab \u2014 most of its backers, including the university itself, had remained silent on the issue. The event, held on 25 February and attended by around 600 marchers, represents a change of strategy amid swelling grassroots support for the lab and growing indignation over the intimidating tactics of animal-rights extremists. \u201cThe university was not keen on raising the ante with a public protest,\u201d says Evan Harris, a local member of parliament. \u201cBut once there was this threat to Oxford students, I think the balance changed.\u201d Harris describes the event as \u201cthe best kind of rabble-rousing\u201d, with protestors chanting slogans such as: \u201cNo more threats, no more fear; animal testing's wanted here.\u201d \u201cThis is an historic day \u2014 we're drawing a line in the sand,\u201d said Oxford neuroscientist John Stein as he addressed the rally. \u201cWe must not be intimidated. It's not just about research; it's about democracy.\u201d Support for the event was fomented by Laurie Pycroft, a 16-year-old blogger who was moved by what he saw as the one-sidedness of the animal-research debate. Until now, public demonstrations have been the preserve of groups opposed to animal research; scientists have mostly kept their heads below the parapet, for fear of personal reprisals. Pycroft created a research-advocacy website called Pro-Test, under whose banner the rally took place. \u201cI'm extremely proud of the turnout,\u201d he told  Nature . \u201cI would have been happy with 50 people.\u201d Meanwhile, about 150 antivivisection campaigners mounted an opposing demonstration. This event, culminating in a rally at the exact spot where pro-research campaigners had mustered just hours earlier, was part of a series of demonstrations by the animal-rights group Speak. Demonstrators at the Speak rally noted the emergence, for the first time, of large-scale public opposition to their views. One demonstrator called for the issue to receive even wider coverage now that battle lines have been formally drawn. \u201cWe want to see a fair and unedited debate on prime-time television,\u201d he said. It is a debate that traditionally has been played out in actions rather than words. The Oxford lab recently endured an 18-month hiatus in construction after the building company Walter Lilley pulled out in response to bad publicity and diving share prices. Other research facilities, such as Huntingdon Life Sciences near Cambridge, have also been subjected to intimidating tactics and violence from extreme animal-rights groups. Speaking at the Pro-Test event, Simon Festing, director of the London-based Research Defence Society, called animal research a \u201cmoral choice\u201d and \u201ca price worth paying\u201d. And Oxford neuroscientist Tipu Aziz said the march was aimed at \u201cdefending our right to better humanity's plight\u201d. For others, the event was about standing up against what is perceived as bullying from extremists. \u201cWe're sick of the intimidation,\u201d says postgraduate research student Kristina Cook. \u201cIt's amazing how many people support what we do but are afraid.\u201d \n                     UK animal labs still under siege \n                   \n                     TV show gives research lobbyist a rat's-eye view of laboratory life \n                   \n                     Animal rights extremism crosses the Atlantic \n                   \n                     Britain plans laws to restrain animal-rights activists \n                   \n                     Medical research news \n                   \n                     Lab life news \n                   \n                     Pro-Test \n                   \n                     Speak \n                   \n                     University of Oxford \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

A panel of more than 50 scientists, journal editors and ethicists have produced guidelines that they hope will promote international collaborations in a field badly shaken by the South Korean cloning scandal. In Germany, most stem-cell research is illegal, and researchers could in theory be jailed if they participate in embryo experiments abroad. China lacks clear national policies, with different institutes following different rules. Laws also differ between US states. \u201cThe situation is likely to get worse,\u201d adds Robin Lovell-Badge, a stem-cell biologist at the National Institute for Medical Research, London, and member of the panel. He says even countries with well-developed laws must continually update them to cope with emerging techniques. The panel will set up a website where researchers can explain local laws and share existing ethical guidelines. It also wants journal editors to ask authors for more information relating to the ethics of the research they publish, such as the source of cells, to encourage the development of transparent ethical standards. The group stresses the importance of obeying national laws, but calls on countries such as Germany to reconsider legislation that extends to research elsewhere. \u201cLaws all around the world are stopping international collaboration,\u201d says panel member Julian Savulescu, an ethicist at the University of Oxford, UK. The meeting, which took place over 22\u201324 February in Hinxton, UK, took two years to plan. It was not designed to tackle fraud, such as the case of Woo Suk Hwang, the South Korean scientist who faked data showing stem cells could be extracted from cloned human embryos. But the group does propose that egg donors are treated in the same way as human research subjects, meaning that Hwang's use of eggs from his researchers would probably not have been approved. The group plans to meet again, probably within two years, to discuss new technologies such as chimaeras.

Washington DC Al Gore, the former US vice-president who lost his fight for the presidency to George W. Bush in 2000, is starring in a new documentary that features his presentations on climate change. The film is just one of several science-related documentaries hitting the big screen this year. The environment has long interested Gore, who published a book on the threat of climate change,  Earth in the Balance , in 1992. More recently he has been touring the United States with a slide-show presentation on the dangers that his scientist supporters say is scientifically accurate and compelling. \u201cHe's very effective and right on target, and I've never seen better visuals,\u201d says Eric Chivian, director of the Center for Health and the Global Environment at Harvard Medical School in Boston, who helped Gore with sections on the effects of global warming on polar bears. Michael Oppenheimer, a geoscientist and environmental-policy expert at Princeton University, agrees. \u201cI have talked to thousands of politicians and very few of them have been willing to do the homework and get down to the details,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen Al Gore gets revved up, he is very impressive.\u201d But it wasn't until Gore's slide-show was made into a feature-length documentary, first screened at the Sundance film festival in Utah last month, that his efforts started making headlines around the world.  An Inconvenient Truth  was directed by Davis Guggenheim and produced by Participant Productions, a film company set up in 2004 with an explicitly activist agenda. The company's other films include  Syriana  and  Good Night and Good Luck , which deal with the global oil industry and the freedom of the press, respectively. Last week, Participant Productions secured a distribution deal with Paramount Pictures that should see  An Inconvenient Truth  get a US release in May. Supporters hope that the film will not only revive Gore's political career but will take his climate message to a wider audience than his original slide-show could ever have reached. Thom Powers, a documentary producer who heads the documentary film programme at the Toronto International Film Festival, says that both science and political documentaries are becoming much more popular. \u201c March of the Penguins  was I think the second-highest grossing documentary of all time, second only to Michael Moore's  Farenheit 9/11 ,\u201d he says. \u201cAl Gore's documentary has a nice confluence of a couple of different interest areas: growing viability of political documentaries, and interest in the environment.\u201d The trend is growing. Moore, who helped get documentaries into movie theatres with his hit films  Bowling for Columbine , about gun control in the United States, and  Farenheit 9/11 , about the Bush administration's actions in the wake of the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001, is now working on a film about the pharmaceutical industry, called  Sicko . And one of the year's most talked about films is Werner Herzog's  Grizzly Man , a portrait of a man who lived among \u2014 and was eventually eaten by \u2014 Alaska's grizzly bears and claimed to be protecting them, although government experts say the population is doing well. Doron Weber, who runs the Public Understanding of Science and Technology programme at the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation in New York, gave an award to Herzog's film. He says that boom times for documentaries are good for showing the subtleties of science. \u201cA film like  Grizzly Man  presents a character in the round and presents conflicting ideas,\u201d he says. \u201cFilm is such a good medium for this.\u201d Another director taking advantage of the medium is Randy Olson. His film  Flock of Dodos , about the clashes between evolutionary scientists and advocates of intelligent design, had its first screening in Kansas earlier this month. Olson comes down on the side of evolution, but sends a message that scientists have neglected the communication skills needed to engage with mass audiences, and failed to compete with the public-relations operations of advocates of intelligent design. \u201cScience has backed into this lumbering, conservative corner, with no flexibility to deal with something like intelligent design when it comes up,\u201d says Olson. Chivian says the same of the climate-change debate: \u201cWhat really worries me is that scientists haven't done a great job of communicating these issues. We are trained to talk in technical language to each other.\u201d Many hope that the new wave of science documentaries will help to change that.

Sydney Claims from Australian scientists that they have been gagged in discussions of climate change have revealed a culture of fear at the nation's leading research laboratory. An investigative television programme aired by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation on 13 February claimed that three prominent climate scientists from the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) were censored in discussions of climate change and energy research. Against the backdrop of the Australian government's refusal to back the Kyoto Protocol on climate change, there has been a public outcry over this and other media reports of political interference in the prominent research agency, which publishes high-impact studies on climate change. Political opponents have called for an independent inquiry into the allegations. On 21 February, the CSIRO announced a review of how it provides scientific input into policy development. Graeme Pearman, a CSIRO veteran and former chief of the agency's atmospheric research division, says that in 2004 he was advised to withdraw his name from a report by the independent Australian Climate Group that recommended targets for reducing greenhouse-gas emissions. Steve Morton, chief of CSIRO Sustainable Ecosystems, and Pearman's manager at the time, admits that he asked Pearman not to participate but denies that scientists are censored. \u201cWe encourage our scientific staff to speak about their work. But there are certain areas where we urge them to tread warily and not to beat someone else's political drum.\u201d Like US science agencies (see above), the CSIRO's official policy permits staff to discuss their scientific work, but advises against commenting on government policies. It says they should only express private opinions when it is clear that it is their personal view. But the line between science and policy is blurred, say CSIRO scientists, with the greatest tension being in environmental research into climate, water and energy. \u201cScientists are encouraged to do policy-relevant research and yet not be policy prescriptive \u2014 there is a very fine line,\u201d says climate expert Barrie Pittock, another CSIRO veteran who spoke out in the television programme. Pittock says he was told not to discuss mitigation in a 2003 report commissioned by the government's Australian Greenhouse Office. In particular, he says he was asked to tone down his discussion of how rising sea levels could displace people in southeast Asia, because of potential immigration implications for Australia. Critics say the CSIRO's weakness in public debates on environmental issues in the face of conservative government policies is down to financial insecurity. Government funding has been eroded and there is pressure on the agency to find external funding sources and industry partners. \u201cThere are a lot of fearful science managers second-guessing what they think government wants to hear,\u201d says the third whistleblower, Barney Foran, who retired from the CSIRO last year. When the government appointed a biofuel taskforce in 2005, Foran says, he was warned not to say anything negative about ethanol fuel. Other ex-CSIRO scientists deny being censored, but acknowledge that the mood at the agency has changed in recent years. \u201cThe CSIRO is very mute on key environmental issues at the moment,\u201d says John Williams, who retired from the CSIRO in 2004 after heading the land and water division. And there is concern that younger staff feel constrained. \u201cAnyone who has a baby and a mortgage would be crazy to speak out,\u201d says Foran. But the culture of fear has been created by perception rather than reality, says Michael Borgas, president of the CSIRO's staff association. \u201cThe crux of the problem is job insecurity,\u201d he says, pointing out that annual staff turnover is 21% and that most new positions are short-term or casual appointments. \u201cWith that backdrop, people aren't going to be pushing issues or debates that bring the spotlight on them.\u201d \n                     Diet book attacked for its high-protein advice \n                   \n                     Scientists complain government cash is no rise in real terms \n                   \n                     Climate change in focus \n                   \n                     Earth and Environment news channel \n                   \n                     ABC's \u201cThe Greenhouse Mafia\u201d documentary \n                   \n                     Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) \n                   \n                     Australian Greenhouse Office \n                   \n                     Graeme Pearson at CSIRO \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

St Louis, Missouri The rift between US scientists and the administration of President George W. Bush widened last weekend, as Nobel-prizewinning biologist David Baltimore used the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS)in St Louis to denounce government suppression of scientific findings. Speaking last Saturday to a packed conference room, Baltimore \u2014 the president-elect of the AAAS \u2014 urged scientists to challenge perceived censorship of their research. Tensions between the Bush administration and researchers have been high for years, but Baltimore said he had recently grown convinced that the problem cannot be shrugged off as the usual battles between science and politics. \u201cIt is no accident that we are seeing such extensive suppression of science,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is part of a theory of government, and I believe it is a theory that we must vociferously oppose.\u201d In particular, Baltimore condemned the \u201cunitary executive\u201d theory of government \u2014 the notion that a president can bypass Congressional and judicial oversight and run the country single-handedly (see  page 891 ). Baltimore argued that this approach threatens to undermine the independence of science conducted under the auspices of the federal government. Major US science agencies such as NASA, the National Science Foundation and the National Institutes of Health are all part of the executive branch of government, meaning that their employees answer ultimately to the president. In recent weeks, several researchers have gone public with charges that their government minders censored or otherwise manipulated their findings (see  \u2018Censored Science?\u2019 ). The latest round began last month, when James Hansen, a climate scientist at NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York, charged that NASA was trying to stop him doing media interviews that might cover policies on greenhouse-gas emissions. The 24-year-old NASA press officer who was the source of many of Hansen's complaints eventually resigned (see  Nature   439 , 643; 2006). The accusations have left many government-funded researchers wondering about their role in public debate over science policy. Are they allowed to speak their mind based on the latest science? Or must they hold their tongue and respect their employer's wishes? \u201cThere's no precise line that has been laid down,\u201d says Daniel Greenberg, a guest scholar at the Brookings Institution, a non-partisan think-tank based in Washington DC. Instead, scientists must navigate the grey zone where science meets public policy. Scientists employed by the government have different rights from those at universities or other private institutions, says Louis Clark, president of the Government Accountability Project, a Washington-based non-profit that is advising Hansen. Federal scientists, he says, can present their data publicly but must be clear that they are not representing their agency or government policy. \u201cThe cardinal rule,\u201d Clark says, \u201cis that you can speak for yourself, but you can't speak for the government unless you're authorized to do so.\u201d Australia's largest funding agency, where scientists are also claiming to have been blocked from talking about climate and energy research, makes a similar argument. Still, Hansen and others say that they must speak their minds for science to proceed. Hansen, for instance, is an expert on global temperature records, which are relevant to policies on greenhouse gases. \u201cHow can a democracy function,\u201d he asks, \u201cif the public is not informed, honestly and fully informed?\u201d Such tales are not unique to the Bush administration. In 1993, physicist William Happer resigned unwillingly as head of the Department of Energy's Office of Energy Research after contradicting then-vice-president Al Gore. The vice-president had stated that ozone depletion at the South Pole would lead to dangerous amounts of ultraviolet-B radiation; Happer pointed out that the oblique angle at which the sun hit the pole meant that even a thin ozone layer could absorb the rays. But the current administration's policies on climate change, which most scientists agree are far out of step with the best available data, have exacerbated the situation. Not all government employees have felt pressured. Rita Colwell, who headed the National Science Foundation under presidents Clinton and Bush, told the AAAS meeting that she had \u201cnot at any time come under political pressure from any quarter\u201d. But speaking after Colwell, Susan Wood, a former scientist at the Food and Drug Administration, spoke of her reasons for resigning last August, after her boss repeatedly delayed a decision to make the Plan B contraceptive more widely available (see  Nature   437 , 179; 200510.1038/437179a ). The morale of scientists at her former agency was at its lowest point ever, Wood said. She got a standing ovation. \n                     Science shares the limelight as election battle enters final phase \n                   \n                     US science policy: Mission impossible? \n                   \n                     Science policy: Policy, politics and perspective \n                   \n                     Union of Concerned Scientists \n                   \n                     James Hansen, Columbia University \n                   \n                     NASA \n                   \n                     US Food and Drug Administration \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Tokyo Politicians and legal experts debating whether to allow females to inherit the Japanese imperial line have consulted geneticists for advice. A government advisory committee considered whether the passage of an intact Y chromosome down a male line of descent might be a scientific argument for the male-only descent system. They concluded, however, that assigning rights to the throne on the basis of the Y chromosome would give a claim to many ordinary citizens. The incident shows how desperate Japanese politicians are to resolve the problem of Japan's emperor, the latest in what may be the world's longest unbroken imperial line, having no male heir. When Emperor Akihito dies, the throne will pass to his two sons. But it's unclear what will happen after that. His grandchildren are all female, and at ages 39 and 42, the princes' wives are running out of time to produce a boy. Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi has thrown his weight behind an amendment to allow the oldest child of either sex to inherit the throne. This would allow the four-year-old daughter of the eldest prince to be next in line. Last year, Koizumi vowed to propose the amendment during the parliament's current session, which began on 20 January. Nature  has learned that in a series of cabinet meetings held ahead of Koizumi's pledge, politicians, historians and legal experts called on scientists for advice. Some experts, vigorously opposed to the idea of allowing females to pass on the line, used the Y chromosome to support their argument. Government records show that committee member Hidetsugu Yagi, an expert in constitutional law at Takasaki City University of Economics, referred to the \u201cstamp of the Y chromosome\u201d, and the need to preserve it. Analogous pairs of all the other chromosomes swap genetic elements, which disrupts the integrity of the DNA sequences. But only 5% of the Y chromosome combines with the X chromosome; the rest is conserved. This means the Y chromosome has unmatched genetic integrity and forms an ideal marker for the male line (see  \u2018Tracing a Y chromosome through 100 generations\u2019 ). \u201cIn a male-descent system, even a distant relative will have inherited the same Y chromosome,\u201d said Yagi. \u201cOf course our ancestors didn't have this knowledge of genetics, but they would have known that blood can be inherited.\u201d But the argument backfired, when Akinori Takamori, a historian of ancient Japan at Takushoku University in Tokyo, told the meeting that if the Y chromosome were so well conserved, it would also have been passed down a countless number of splinter lines over the past 1,000 years. \u201cThe distinction between the average citizen and the imperial household would become uncertain,\u201d he says. Isao Tokoro, an expert in Japanese legal history at Kyoto Sangyo University, Kyoto City, agreed: \u201cI don't think the \u2018stamp of the Y chromosome\u2019 is very meaningful here.\u201d So the Y-chromosome argument did not make it into the committee's final report. After receiving the advice in November, Koizumi promised to push for a gender-neutral amendment in this season's parliament \u2014 a measure apparently supported by 80% of the population. The situation was confused earlier this month, however, by the announcement that the second prince's wife was 6-weeks pregnant. With the possibility of a male heir within the imperial line, conservatives are pushing Koizumi to postpone the issue, something he looks set to do. \n                     The male-specific region of the human Y chromosome is a mosaic of discrete sequence classes \n                   \n                     A physical map of the human Y chromosome \n                   \n                     Jefferson fathered slave's last child \n                   \n                     The Y Chromosome Consortium \n                   \n                     Japanese Imperial Household Agency \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Harvard University's president Larry Summers is facing a fresh challenge to his leadership that some say could further undermine his ability to lead the institution. Summers provoked a storm of controversy early last year after suggesting that intrinsic differences in ability between the sexes could explain why so few women have senior positions in science. The angry response mushroomed into a wider attack on what many describe as Summers' overbearing leadership style. It culminated in March in a vote of no confidence by the largest and most powerful of the university's faculties, the Faculty of Arts and Sciences (FAS; see  Nature   434 , 424; 200510.1038/434424b ). Summers weathered that storm, partly by apologizing repeatedly and promising to listen to his colleagues more. But anger among the faculty continued to simmer and has now bubbled over again. The latest uprising was triggered by the resignation in January of William Kirby from his post as dean of the FAS. Kirby disagreed with Summers on some issues. \u201cThe faculty got very upset at the notion that the dean was being forced out,\u201d says Everett Mendelsohn, a Harvard historian of science and critic of Summers. The brouhaha has triggered renewed attacks on Summers and calls for his resignation. The FAS is now set to vote on a second motion of no confidence at a meeting on 28 February. The ability to resolve the conflict may rest with the Harvard Corporation, the executive board that hired Summers and has the power to oust him. Last year, the corporation issued two statements in support of the university president \u2014 his bold style is said to be part of the reason they hired him \u2014 but it has so far remained silent on the current dispute. A further motion scheduled for vote at the 28 February faculty meeting calls on the corporation to intervene. The search for Kirby's replacement may now be frozen until the situation with Summers is settled. The upheaval is also taking its toll on the university's ability to raise funds and is distracting from plans to reform the curriculum. \u201cIt's basically paralysing business above a certain level,\u201d says Richard Thomas, chair of the Classics department and a member of the faculty council. \n                     Harvard University \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Scientific cooperation between India and the United States has been dented ahead of US President George Bush's official visit to New Delhi next month. Bush will find India's scientific community in a bitter mood following the United States' failure to give a visa to a leading Indian organic chemist on the suspicion that his work could be related to chemical warfare. Bush was already preparing to deal with a nuclear establishment unwilling to separate its military and civilian atomic facilities the way Washington wants, a principle at the centre of last July's historic deal for nuclear cooperation between the two countries (see  Nature   436 , 446\u2013447; 2005). But the visa issue is creating a new wave of resentment. Goverdhan Mehta, a former director of the Indian Institute of Science (IISc) in Bangalore, had been invited as a visiting professor to the University of Florida at Gainesville, but says he was asked to prove that he was not working on chemical weapons before a visa was issued. Mehta does not seem to have been singled out \u2014 the US Embassy in New Delhi said in a statement that it is \u201cobliged to obtain sufficient information necessary for evaluating each application\u201d. But Indian scientists attempting to visit the United States on sabbatical or to attend conferences say that the eight-week \u2018enquiry\u2019 period is demeaning. \u201cThis is too much,\u201d says Mehta, who is a member of the Indian prime minister's science advisory panel and president of the Paris-based International Council of Science, which is committed to the free movement of scientists. \u201cIf the United States wants science cooperation with India it cannot humiliate our scientists the way I was treated by its consular officials.\u201d Many Indian researchers have now withdrawn from the process altogether. \u201cAs a matter of principle I have stopped going to the United States,\u201d says biochemist Govindarajan Padmanaban, another former director of the IISc. \u201cI am on the panel of the Indo\u2013US vaccine action programme but have decided only to attend the panel meetings in India.\u201d C. N. R. Rao, science adviser to India's prime minister, says he agrees that visa applications need to be scrutinized, but doesn't see why it can't be done more tactfully. \u201cI have decided never to attend an interview for a visa,\u201d he says. India's science secretary Valangiman Ramamurthi warns that the United States stands to lose out on collaborations. For instance, he claims that India's interest in the International Linear Collider project \u201chas come down tenfold because our team could not attend a workshop in the United States due to visa problems\u201d. Samir Brahmachari, director of the Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology in Delhi, says he was body-searched at an airport in New York last year, despite having a diplomatic passport. \u201cI have suggested that the IISc should cut off all US collaboration,\u201d he says. \u201cAs for myself, I have decided not to go to the United States. My institute is looking to China, Japan and Taiwan for research collaborations.\u201d Officials at the US Embassy in New Delhi say it is not US policy to comment on individual visas. But in a statement released on 18 February, they said: \u201cAt the United States mission in India, certain cases involving high-technology issues require review before consular officers are authorized to issue a visa.

Gerald Schatten was the Western face of Woo Suk Hwang's stem-cell team, which was recently exposed for faking the results of cloning experiments. On 10 February, Schatten was cleared of misconduct by his university, but chided for taking so much credit for research in which he was barely involved. The University of Pittsburgh in Philadelphia decided to investigate Schatten in December after claims in a  Science  paper that he had co-authored with Seoul National University's Hwang turned out to be false (see W. S. Hwang  et al .  Science   308,  1777\u20131783; 2005 and  Nature   438 , 718; 200510.1038/438718b ). Schatten was senior author on the paper, and his gushing praise of Hwang's research was instrumental in raising the South Korean team's profile in the United States and elsewhere. The full report has not been released, but in a public summary, the six anonymous investigators conclude that there is no evidence that Schatten knew about the fraud taking place in Hwang's lab, and they applaud Schatten for taking swift action when he became convinced that Hwang's team had obtained eggs unethically, to create the world's first stem-cell line from a cloned human embryo back in 2004. But they are less pleased with Schatten's decision to name himself senior author on a paper for which his only contribution was editorial. The summary also points out that Schatten signed a cover letter for the 2005  Science  paper claiming that all 25 authors of the paper had read and approved of the manuscript, when very few of them probably had. And it notes that Schatten's co-authorship of a 2005  Nature  paper (see B. C. Lee  et al .  Nature   436 , 641; 2005) reporting the first cloned dog, Snuppy, was based solely on the dubious suggestion \u201cthat a professional photographer be engaged so that Snuppy would appear with greater visual appeal\u201d. Although stopping short of misconduct, the panel describes Schatten's actions as \u201cresearch misbehaviour\u201d. Stem-cell researchers contacted by  Nature  generally approve of the report and its conclusions. \u201cDr Schatten was as much of a victim as the scientific community,\u201d says Evan Snyder, who directs the stem-cell programme at the Burnham Institute in La Jolla, California. \u201cUltimately a collaboration comes down to trust.\u201d Arnold Kriegstein, who directs stem-cell work at the University of California at San Francisco, agrees, but says he is disappointed that Schatten, as \u201cthe first line of defence\u201d against fraud, did not spot problems earlier. \u201cIt's hard not to think of Schatten as partly a victim, but on the other hand we were all let down by the lack of careful scrutiny.\u201d However, George Annas, a bioethics professor at Boston University School of Public Health in Massachusetts, is deeply disappointed by the report, which he calls \u201cpathetic\u201d. Signing off a cover letter claiming all the authors approved of the manuscript was clearly wrong, he says. He feels that the race to clear high-profile research hurdles will always bring the temptation to cut corners, and that the report is too easy on Schatten: \u201cThe university is basically saying, we will treat you pretty good if you get caught.\u201d Donald Kennedy, editor-in-chief of  Science,  is also uneasy. \u201cThe report raises questions,\u201d he says. \u201cNobody I know knows what \u2018research misbehaviour\u2019 is.\u201d He adds that  Science 's own review will look further into the legitimacy of Schatten's senior authorship on the 2005 paper. \u201cI thought that he had been over there [to Hwang's lab], and that he was involved with experimental strategies,\u201d he says. Schatten has kept out of the public eye since his break with Hwang in November last year. Like Schatten, officials at the University of Pittsburgh have declined to be interviewed. The full report has been submitted to the dean of Pittsburgh's medical school, Arthur Levine, who will decide whether Schatten should face disciplinary action. \n                     Timeline of a controversy \n                   \n                     Stem cells in focus \n                   \n                     Woo Suk Hwang special \n                   \n                     University of Pittsburgh Medical Center \n                   \n                     University of Pittsburgh's summary report \n                   \n                     Gerald Schatten \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

The H5NI avian flu virus has spread to Africa and the European Union for the first time. Attention is focused on controlling the outbreaks, especially in Nigeria, where, as  Nature  went to press, four farms in two adjacent provinces were confirmed as being affected, with further spread suspected. But experts are also urgently trying to confirm the cause of the virus's geographical spread. Although migratory birds have been widely blamed, some believe that the risks posed by the poultry trade are being overlooked. Until last summer, the virus was restricted to hotspots in a handful of countries in southeast Asia. But since then it has fanned out across the globe, crossing Eurasia into Europe and Africa. The disease's appearance in Africa marks a huge leap in its range, and opens a new front that could vastly increase the bird reservoir that could spark a human pandemic (see  Nature   437 , 1212\u20131213; 2005). As in southeast Asia, rural communities often depend heavily on poultry farming, and live in close contact with both domestic and migratory birds. The outbreak began in Jaji village, in Kaduna state in northern Nigeria, on 10 January and killed 40,000 battery chickens, although it was reported to the World Organization for Animal Health only on 6 February. Over the weekend, outbreaks in wild swans were reported for the first time in Greece, Italy, Bulgaria and Slovenia. Swans are often sentinels of the presence of wider infections, as their large size means their deaths are the first to be noticed. Most public-health efforts are focused on preventing further spread of the virus in Africa, and urging local populations to avoid butchering and other practices that could lead to human cases. But carrying out an effective assessment of which species pose the highest risk and which areas could be hit next, as well as setting up appropriate monitoring and control measures, depends on knowing how the virus is spreading. And on this issue experts are divided. Many blame migrating birds. The gene sequence of the virus in Nigeria is identical to that found in Turkey last summer, and the country is a major flyway for several migratory birds from Eurasia. One large genetic study published this month also found that H5NI was present in otherwise healthy migratory birds in overwintering sites in southern China just before their migration (H. Chen  et al .  Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA   103,  2845\u20132850; 2006). But it is difficult to be sure whether migratory birds are sparking new outbreaks in poultry, or whether they pick up the virus from poultry infected by other routes. The same study, which analysed more than 13,000 virus samples, also found that trade and poultry movements were by far the biggest factor driving both the repeated spread of the virus outwards from its cradle in southern China and its genetic diversity. \u201cThe link [to migratory birds] seems to remain circumstantial and speculative,\u201d says Nick Davidson, deputy secretary-general of the Swiss-based Ramsar Convention on Wetlands. \u201cNo clear evidence is available,\u201d agrees Salim Javed, an ornithologist at the Environmental Research and Wildlife Development Agency in Abu Dhabi. He adds that if migratory birds had played a major role he would have expected widespread outbreaks across India, the Middle East and Africa during the autumn migration. This did not happen. Outbreaks may have occurred in other African countries but not been reported, says Juan Lubroth, a senior official at the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization. \u201cThere may be points in between that we don't know about, that might connect the dots,\u201d he says. Indeed, international agencies are tracking rumours of outbreaks in several African countries, including Mali, Egypt, Malawi and Libya. But Lubroth agrees that \u201cit is too easy to point at wild birds\u201d. In many African countries there is scant surveillance of travellers carrying eggs and other poultry products, he points out. Richard Thomas, a spokesman for Birdlife International, says he is \u201cincreasingly concerned that the continued focus on wild birds as the principal means of transmission of the virus is both misguided and a dangerous channelling away of valuable resources\u201d. Countries with strict bans on poultry imports from neighbouring infected countries, such as Myanmar, South Korea and Malaysia, are currently free of the disease. There are previous cases of smuggling and the legal poultry trade causing long-distance spread of H5N1, adds Thomas. He says a 2004 poultry outbreak in Lhasa, Tibet, was traced to the transport of birds from Lanzhou in China's Gansu province, 1,500 kilometres away. \u201cThe death of poultry from an identical viral strain in locations many kilometres apart says nothing about how the virus was transferred between the two places.\u201d Major railway lines link southern China to Kazakhstan, Russia and Eastern Europe, and many believe these could be a route for transmission of the virus from Asia to Eurasia. \n                     Thai dogs carry bird-flu virus, but will they spread it? \n                   \n                     Bird flu reaches Africa \n                   \n                     Bird flu's bodily harm revealed \n                   \n                     Migration threatens to send flu south \n                   \n                     Avian flu special \n                   \n                     Avian flu web resources on Connotea \n                   \n                     FAO avian flu site \n                   \n                     WHO avian flu site \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Journal rankings should measure quality, not just quantity, say researchers who are proposing a new way to assess the status of science publications. Whereas the commonly used impact factor simply measures the number of citations per paper, the researchers say their ranking scheme also measures the significance of those citations, giving a truer measure of a journal's standing in the community. Ranking journals and publications is not just an academic exercise. Such schemes are increasingly used by funding agencies to assess the research of individuals and departments. They also serve as a guide for librarians choosing which journals to subscribe to. All this puts pressure both on researchers to publish in journals with high rankings and on journal editors to attract papers that will boost their journal's profile. The most popular index of a journal's status is the ISI Impact Factor (IF), produced by Thomson Scientific. It counts the total number of citations a journal's papers receive, and divides it by the number of papers the journal publishes. But the rise of online journals, coupled with sophisticated search engines that permit rankings of web resources, is triggering a wave of other measures. Last year, for example, physicist Jorge Hirsch of the University of California, San Diego, proposed a metric called the h-index for assessing the quality of researchers' publications (see  Nature   436 , 900; 2005). Now Johan Bollen and his colleagues at the Research Library of Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico are focusing on Google's PageRank (PR) algorithm. The algorithm provides a kind of peer assessment of the value of a web page, by counting not just the number of pages linking to it, but also the number of pages pointing to those links, and so on. So a link from a popular page is given a higher weighting than one from an unpopular page. The algorithm can be applied to research publications by analysing how many times those who cite a paper are themselves cited. Whereas the IF measures crude \u2018popularity\u2019, PR is a measure of prestige, says Bollen. He predicts that metrics such as the PR ranking may come to be more influential in the perception of a journal's status than the traditional IF. \u201cWeb searchers have collectively decided that PageRank helps them separate the wheat from the chaff,\u201d he says. Bollen, however, proposes combining the two metrics. \u201cOne can more completely evaluate the status of a journal by comparing and aggregating the different ways it has acquired that status,\u201d he says. Some journals, he points out, can have high IFs but low PRs (perhaps indicating a popular but less prestigious journal), and vice versa (for a high-quality but niche publication). Using information from different metrics would also make the rankings harder to manipulate, he adds. So Bollen and his colleagues propose ranking journals according to the product of the IF and PR, a measure they call the Y-factor. Whereas the top ten list by IF includes many journals that publish only review articles, or that serve primarily as data resources, the Y-factor ranking pushes up journals widely regarded as publishing prestigious original research (see  table ). For example, among physics journals, the IF places  Reviews of Modern Physics  at the top of the list, but the Y-factor shifts the emphasis to rapid-publication journals.  Physical Review Letters  is the most influential, with a Y-factor of 5.91\u00d710 \u22122 . (Declaration of interest:  Nature  receives a very high Y-factor.) Reinhardt Schuhmann, an editor on  Physical Review Letters , calls the proposal \u201can interesting idea\u201d, but thinks that such metrics aren't really needed to prove status. \u201cWe don't pay much attention to impact factors,\u201d he says. But for Bollen, ranking journals more effectively by combining different ranking systems could help protect the integrity of science. He warns that scientists and funding agencies have used the ranking system well beyond its intended purpose. \u201cWe've heard horror stories from colleagues who have been subjected to evaluation by their departments or national funding agencies which they felt were strongly influenced by their personal IF,\u201d he says. \u201cMany fear this may eventually reduce the healthy diversity of viewpoints and research subjects that we would normally hope to find in the scholarly community.\u201d Jim Pringle, vice-president of development at Thomson Scientific, is also keen on the idea. \u201cWe have always advocated that research evaluation should be derived not only from metrics such as the IF but also from a thorough knowledge of research content,\u201d he says. \u201cJournal status metrics such as this, used in combination with our data, should be encouraged.\u201d \u2192  http://www.arxiv.org/abs/cs.GL/0601030 \n                     Index aims for fair ranking of scientists \n                   \n                     Science searches shift up a gear as Google starts Scholar engine \n                   \n                     The Y-factor preprint \n                   \n                     The ISI impact factor \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Proposed cuts to NASA's science budget have unleashed a storm of anger from US astronomers and planetary researchers, who say the reductions would cause irreparable harm and drive young people from the field. Under a NASA budget unveiled on 6 February (see  Nature   439 , 644; 2006), growth in science spending between 2007 and 2010 would be slashed by 17%. The budget proposed by President George W. Bush has yet to be approved by Congress, but many planned projects \u2014 from planet searches to a Mars sample return, as well as scores of individual research grants \u2014 are likely to be scrapped (see  \u2018Some cuts proposed at NASA\u2019 ). Planetary scientist Alan Boss of the Carnegie Institution of Washington says the cuts would devastate US space science \u2014 just as physics was jolted when the Superconducting Super Collider was cancelled in 1993, after $2 billion had been spent on it. \u201cHigh energy physics never quite recovered from that.\u201d Scientists appreciate that NASA's administrator, Mike Griffin, is struggling to balance his books. Griffin explained during the budget press conference that the science cuts were necessary to pay for shuttle flights required to complete the International Space Station. \u201cIt's what we needed to do,\u201d he said regretfully. But Jonathan Lunine, a planetary scientist at the University of Arizona, Tucson, sums up the view of many when he says he finds it \u201cpuzzling and frustrating\u201d that NASA would divert money from science, widely considered its most productive enterprise, to keep the aged space shuttles flying. \u201cIt seems that NASA is trying to capitalize on its failures rather than its successes,\u201d says Lunine. Particularly hard hit is the search for new planets, a field that appeals to young scientists, says Charles Beichman of the California Institute of Technology, Pasadena. NASA could keep developing technologies for the Terrestrial Planet Finder (TPF) mission given just $10 million next year, he says. Instead, the TPF's budget will be wiped out. NASA claims the mission is \u201cdeferred indefinitely\u201d, says Beichman. \u201cThe fact is, they are cancelling the TPF. They are breaking up the technology team.\u201d There is fury not just at the size of the cuts, but at how they were decided and announced to the science community. Heidi Hammel, a planetary researcher with the Space Science Institute in Boulder, Colorado, says that NASA's advisory council was not operating during much of last year and so \u201cthere was absolutely no way to know how these decisions had been made. It's sort of like a black hole over there.\u201d The lack of communication extended even to projects that were being axed. For example, the California Institute of Technology's Fiona Harrison had an Explorer mission that was about to enter its development phase after two years of work. But in what Beichman calls an \u201cegregious breakdown of the process\u201d, she learned during the press conference that her NuSTAR X-ray astronomy satellite had actually been cancelled. Harrison estimates that about 200 scientists are planning to send petitions or protest letters to NASA. Craig Wheeler, president-elect of the American Astronomical Society, says the society will argue that NASA's science projects should share in the generous increases granted to other research agencies for 2007. But many space scientists are still just trying to figure out what it all means \u2014 and they believe the draconian cuts won't even fix NASA's larger budget problems. Gregory Junemann is president of the International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers, NASA's largest union. \u201cDevouring everything else at the agency, while holding out for some future financial miracle, is irresponsible,\u201d he says \n                     Biomedicine to sell itself as a local hero \n                   \n                     Physics wins the US budget race \n                   \n                     Planet hunters lose out to Hubble rescue \n                   \n                     NASA budget kills Hubble telescope \n                   \n                     Earth science loses autonomy as NASA switches focus to the Moon \n                   \n                     Space shuttle: return to flight special \n                   \n                     Human space flight in focus \n                   \n                     Mars in focus \n                   \n                     Physical sciences news \n                   \n                     The US budget documents \n                   \n                     NASA budget briefing \n                   \n                     Response from The Planetary Society \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

And those who ventured to the top of the mountain in a helicopter found \u201ca bizarre red-faced and wattled honeyeater bird\u201d. The male Berlepsch's six-wired bird of paradise, never before seen by Western scientists, put on a display for a female that convinced the team that it is a separate species, not just a new subspecies as previously thought. Finding so much unknown biodiversity is a rare event, which some conservationists say happens only every few decades. Others compare the find to the discovery of tens of frog species in Sri Lanka in 2002 or the discovery of three new mammals in Vietnam in the 1990s. The main scientific significance is that it may be easier than previously thought for clusters of unique species to arise. The area used to be an arc of islands, pushed up over time into an isolated mountain range, so scientists were optimistic about finding endemic species there. But Foja is much smaller than other areas where this has occurred, such as the highlands of the Bird's Head Peninsula to the west and the Huon Peninsular to the southeast. \u201cOur study has shown that the \u2018little\u2019 Foja mountains are big enough to constitute a significant area of species endemism,\u201d says Bruce Beehler, a Conservation International scientist who led the trip. Beehler and others want similar investigations to be carried out elsewhere in New Guinea, as well as stretches of the Congo and Amazon basins. \u201cIt confirms my view that there is still much to be discovered and conserved,\u201d says Scott Zona, a palm specialist at the Fairchild Tropical Botanic Garden in Coral Gables, Florida. \u201cJust because Google Earth serves up satellite images of the planet, we should not feel that our world is fully explored.\u201d The scientists realize that analysis of the calls, colours, ecology, description and DNA of their specimens will be needed to convince the scientific world of their findings. Beehler says that the birds, butterflies, plants and frogs discovered are for the most part \u201cclear and unambiguous\u201d, but that further work will be needed to clarify the taxonomic status of the mammals. The palms will also require \u201cpainstaking comparisons with known species\u201d, says Zona. But the results will be worth it, especially if, as suspected, one is a new species of a rare genus ( Pholidocarpus ) only known in Thailand, Malaysia and western Indonesia. \u201cI am hungry for more details,\u201d he says. Another expedition scheduled for the dry season later this year should find even more species, says Yance de Fretes, an Indonesian tropical ecologist at Conservation International, as the constant rain in December made it difficult to find mammals and butterflies. \u201cThe frog people were very happy,\u201d he notes. But the headlines could attract not just scientific attention but also poachers. According to Asep Purnama, director of the conservationist group ProFauna Indonesia, the country has a vigorous illegal trade in rare and endangered species \u2014 especially orangutans, leaf monkeys and parrots \u2014 thought to be worth a staggering US$900 million every year. De Fretes admits that tradesmen might be able to rent a helicopter and pay locals to get access. But he says this is all the more reason to report the species to those who could protect them. \u201cIt is important to get the information to the decision-makers,\u201d he says. \u201cWe need to show how important it is to conserve this area.\u201d For Indonesian scientists such as Johanis Mogea, a plant biologist at the Indonesian Institute of Sciences who discovered four new species of palm, the trip was a rare chance to see their own country's bounty. Conservation isn't normally a priority, he says. \u201cUsually Indonesian scientists don't have enough money.\u201d Indonesia does not have a great record of conservation, as massive deforestation has cut into its biodiversity. But this week Indonesia's president Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono asked the team's leaders to present their case, de Fretes says. If the international media frenzy over the \u2018lost world\u2019 doesn't get his attention, the scientists have another card up their sleeves: they have offered to name one of the new species of butterfly after his wife. \n                     Past century sees biodiversity dive \n                   \n                     Nine more crisis areas for biodiversity \n                   \n                     Biodiversity: A tragedy with many players \n                   \n                     Earth and environment news \n                   \n                     Conservation International \n                   \n                     Animal Info: Papua New Guinea \n                   \n                     PapuaWeb \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Large numbers of domestic dogs and cats in Thailand may be infected with the H5N1 strain of avian flu,  Nature  has learned. Experts are struggling to work out whether such carnivores might be spreading the disease. In an unpublished study carried out last year by the National Institute of Animal Health in Bangkok, researchers led by virologist Sudarat Damrongwatanapokin tested 629 village dogs and 111 cats in the Suphan Buri district of central Thailand. Out of these, 160 dogs and 8 cats had antibodies to H5N1, indicating that they were infected with the virus or had been infected in the past. \u201cThat's a lot,\u201d says Albert Osterhaus, a virologist at the Erasmus University in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. \u201cThis is definitely something to look into.\u201d So far, researchers at Bangkok's Chulalongkorn University have isolated the virus from at least one of the dogs. Wild cats, including tigers, are known to be susceptible to the virus, but this is the first scientific study to find it in dogs, suggesting that infection could be widespread. Osterhaus is pressing officials at the UN Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) and the World Organisation for Animal Health to monitor dogs, cats and other carnivores for H5N1. \u201cIt's a gap in our surveillance,\u201d he says. \u201cBasically all carnivores seem susceptible.\u201d This study is the first to look at the prevalence of the virus in dogs or cats in the field \u2014 despite anecdotal reports of cat deaths near poultry outbreaks. But Osterhaus's team has done experiments showing that domestic cats get ill and die from H5N1, and can transmit the disease to other cats (T. Kuiken  et al .  Science   306,  241; 2004). And last month, a team from his lab published experiments showing that infected cats excrete virus in their faeces as well as in coughed-out droplets, suggesting that they could spread the disease (G. F. Rimmelzwaan  et al .  Am. J. Pathol.   168,  176\u2013183; 2006). \u201cIt is still uncertain what role, if any, this might play in transmission,\u201d says Maria Cheng, a spokeswoman for the World Health Organization. \u201cWe do not have a full understanding of the viral load needed for human infection, and whether or not the infection of animals other than poultry might contribute.\u201d Juan Lubroth, a senior FAO animal-health officer, says that poultry \u2014 not cats and dogs \u2014 is the priority for the agency, whose mandate is food security and agricultural livestock issues. The FAO \u201chas only limited resources\u201d, he says. As there is no evidence of dogs becoming ill or spreading H5N1, Lubroth believes the risk they pose is low. \u201cIt may be important, but today I am not able to cover all bases.

Lobbyists for biomedical science are changing tactics in an attempt to reverse what they see as a worrying decline in funding. As well as talking generally about the benefits of biomedical research, they plan to tailor their arguments to local economic issues, close to lawmakers' hearts. In his 6 February budget request, President George W. Bush asked Congress to keep funding flat for the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in 2007. This would mark the fourth consecutive year that NIH funding has not kept pace with inflation, and advocates are worried. \u201cWe're going to have to change the way we've done things in the past,\u201d says Jon Retzlaff, director of legislative relations for the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology (FASEB). Lobbyists say they aim to dispel the notion that the NIH should be satisfied with the fact that its budget was doubled between 1999 and 2003. They claim that, because of inflation, the agency now has 10% less purchasing power than in 2003, and is on track to issue 3,000 fewer grants in 2007 than in 2003. They also argue that the budget doubling spurred many young people to enter biomedical science. The erosion of that money is leaving these new researchers out in the cold. \u201cWe're eating our seed corn,\u201d says FASEB president Bruce Bistrian, a molecular biologist at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, Massachusetts. \u201cWe could lose a generation of researchers, or at least several years' worth.\u201d So advocacy groups are going local, by showing lawmakers how NIH funding has benefited their states and home districts. Retzlaff says that FASEB will start with districts served by members of the powerful House budget committee, chaired by Republican Jim Nussle of Iowa. And the Association of American Medical Colleges will emphasize that the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center is the largest private employer in western Pennsylvania. \u201cThere are a lot of places around the country that would like to emulate Pittsburgh,\u201d says Dave Moore of the association's office of government relations. \u201cIt's important for us to talk about the role the NIH plays as a driver for local economies.\u201d \n                     US space scientists rage over axed projects \n                   \n                     Physics wins the US budget race \n                   \n                     Young biologists rejected as NIH budget squeezes training grants \n                   \n                     Biology hogs the science budget, senator complains \n                   \n                     Medical research news \n                   \n                     The budget documents \n                   \n                     NIH budget information \n                   \n                     Response from FASEB \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Britain's ability to respond to the threats of climate change and pollution will be damaged if plans to downsize a key research institute go ahead, ecologists have warned. The Centre for Ecology and Hydrology (CEH) risks losing a third of its 600 staff and half of its research sites if its main funder, the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC), follows through with reform proposals. The council says the move will leave the centre with a more focused agenda and with critical science projects intact. But many are unconvinced, pointing out that a holistic approach to studying the impacts of climate change is more important than ever. \u201cWe rely on the CEH's papers when making decisions,\u201d says Richard Jefferson, an ecologist at government-funded conservation body English Nature. \u201cIt seems ridiculous to be pruning this work back.\u201d His organization is one of several to have submitted objections to the proposal under a NERC-run consultation exercise that ended on 15 February. Shaky finances have left the CEH with an annual deficit of around \u00a31 million (US$1.7 million) over the past three years. And the government wants the NERC and other research councils to shift resources from dedicated research institutes to competitive grants programmes. To address these issues, the council wants to reduce the centre's core budget, currently around \u00a320 million, to \u00a315 million. After consulting with the CEH, the NERC proposes to close its research sites at Banchory, Dorset, Monks Wood and Oxford, while retaining just four centres at Bangor, Edinburgh, Lancaster and Wallingford. Once the \u00a345-million costs of the closures have been met, the NERC will plough the savings into other programmes. But many researchers feel that the CEH's multidisciplinary work cannot be replicated elsewhere. The centre brings together fields such as chemistry and wildlife management to answer broader environmental questions. Such an approach, many policy experts say, is the best way to generate predictions on issues such as climate-change impacts that can be used by politicians. For example, at the CEH site in Wallingford, west of London, researchers work with climate scientists and ecologists to model how global vegetation will respond to climate change. \u201cThe CEH provides the glue between the climate and vegetation models,\u201d says Ian Woodward, an ecologist at the University of Sheffield who has worked with Wallingford researchers. \u201cIt's absolutely critical.\u201d Although the site in Wallingford is not slated for closure, cuts will also be made at the retained sites. So researchers there are nervous about their future. Pat Nuttall, director of the CEH, says she is currently consulting with programme directors about possible cuts. She stresses that certain crucial projects, such as collecting long-term data sets on biodiversity and water quality, will be retained. Members of the NERC's 18-strong council, which will meet on 8 March to consider the consultation results, add that the reforms need not cause substantial damage. They argue that reducing duplication of research and high infrastructure costs will allow all crucial CEH work to continue. \u201cThis is not a carving back on science\u201d, says council member Sara Parkin, a programme director at Forum for the Future, a sustainable-development charity in London, who backs the reform plan. \u201cI've been an environmental campaigner for 40 years.

Astronomers trying to define a \u2018planet\u2019 won't announce a decision until August at the earliest, and may duck the issue entirely. In the meantime, researchers are left unable to name some newly discovered objects. The issue was raised when astronomers led by the California Institute of Technology's Mike Brown reported finding objects that came close to Pluto in size, including Quaoar in 2002 and Sedna in 2004. It came to a head in July 2005, when the group announced the discovery of an even larger object, temporarily dubbed 2003 UB 313 . Last week, scientists confirmed that this is substantially bigger than Pluto (F. Bertoldi  et al .  Nature   439 , 563\u2013564; 2006). Until astronomers decide what counts as a planet, UB 313  cannot be officially named. The International Astronomical Union (IAU) catalogues such objects, but different committees are responsible for naming major planets, and mere chunks of rock or ice. The indecision \u201creally interferes with our work\u201d, says Brian Marsden, head of the Minor Planets Centre in Cambridge, Massachusetts, which catalogues thousands of objects every year. Brown's discoveries, 2005 FY9 and 2003 EL61, are also waiting to be named. The IAU set up a 19-strong committee in 2004 to resolve the issue, which reported to the executive committee in November. Some experts suggested that anything spherical that orbits the Sun and is more than 2,000 kilometres across should be called a planet. That size limit would include Pluto and UB 313 , and was selected as \u201carbitrary but sensible\u201d, according to Iwan Williams, president of IAU's planetary-systems sciences division. But other suggestions included stripping Pluto of its title, because thousands of objects occupy the same area of space, known as the Kuiper belt. \u201cWe should speak of eight major planets,\u201d says Marsden. \u201cPeople say schoolchildren will be upset, but so what? It's our job to educate them.\u201d Others disagree. \u201cPluto is obviously a planet,\u201d says Alan Stern of the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colorado, who heads the New Horizons mission that has just set off to Pluto. He argues that anything big enough to form a sphere as it orbits a star should be called a planet \u2014 including the asteroid Ceres.

Evolutionists have provided what they hope is a definitive answer to the question of whether \u2018sympatric speciation\u2019 can occur in the natural world. This is where two or more species diverge from a common ancestor despite sharing the same habitat. The process has been taught as part of evolutionary theory for decades, but has been notoriously difficult to prove. There are candidate cases, such as where parasitic species seem to have diverged on the same host. But solid examples are hard to pin down, as they require showing that two or more species descended from a single ancestor, and that the lineages did not spend any time apart during the entire course of their divergence \u2014 often a span of several million years. Two studies in disparate parts of the globe offer what their authors say are the best shots so far at such a proof. On  page 719  of this issue, Axel Meyer and colleagues at the University of Konstanz in Germany describe two fish species that have apparently diverged despite sharing a relatively small lake (5 kilometres across) in Nicaragua. According to Meyer and his team, it's next to impossible that two such closely related species could have ended up in this very young (less than 23,000-year-old), isolated lake through two colonization events. In a second study, Vincent Savolainen of Britain's Royal Botanic Gardens in Kew and his colleagues report that two species of palm tree seem to have diverged on a remote Australian island (V. Savolainen  et al .  Nature  doi:10.1038/nature04566; 2006). In this case, the remoteness of the island and the shared genetic traits of the species make it extremely unlikely that the trees are descendants of two ancestors that arrived at the island on separate occasions. \u201cAlmost no proposed example of sympatric speciation can be considered absolutely beyond doubt,\u201d comments Jerry Coyne, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Chicago, Illinois. But in both of the newly reported cases, he says, sympatric speciation seems the most likely explanation. William Baker, part of the Kew team, agrees: \u201cMy first reaction is that it's hard to imagine a case being neater than ours \u2014 it sounds immodest but it's almost the ideal scenario.\u201d The big question now is whether sympatric speciation is widespread or rare. Although it is relatively easy to make a convincing case for a remote island or small isolated lake, things will be much tougher when biologists turn to more complex ecosystems such as East Africa's great lakes, home to hundreds of related fish species. \u201cWhat would overturn our view of evolution would be to find that a fairly substantial proportion of all speciation events occur in sympatry,\u201d Coyne says. The concept that such speciation is widespread was largely resisted by the great evolutionist Ernst Mayr, who died last year, says Meyer. Such was Mayr's influence among biologists that he engendered a widespread bias against the idea. \u201cBut I think sympatric speciation will turn out to be more common than people thought,\u201d Meyer adds. \n                     Fish fission found \n                   \n                     Species without frontiers \n                   \n                     Earth and environment news \n                   \n                     Ecology and evolution news \n                   \n                     Genetics news \n                   \n                     Meyer lab, University of Konstanz \n                   \n                     Orchid web pages at Royal Botanical Gardens, Kew \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

San Diego Meteorites have become prime targets for high-end curio dealers, reaching as much as US$10,000 a gram at auction. Professional scavengers have reacted with a flood of space rocks, forcing scientists to take radical steps and set up a centre at the University of Arizona that will buy samples on the open market. \u201cWe don't want to shut down the trade in meteorites, because we can't,\u201d says cosmo-chemist Dante Lauretta of the university's Lunar and Planetary Laboratory in Tucson. But the aim is to preserve as many of the finds as possible for scientific analysis, he says. Meteorites made of material ejected from the Moon and Mars command the highest prices. But their popularity is pushing up the cost of all meteorites \u2014 including those known as chondrites, which are highly prized by scientists because they formed early enough to offer insight into the origins of the Solar System. Over the past decade or so, the promise of bounty has spurred meteorite hunters to scour areas such as the Sahara Desert, the Gobi Desert and Patagonia, where arid conditions preserve specimens for millions of years. Historically, scientists at a number of institutions, including the University of Arizona, have analysed material for collectors or dealers \u2014 in return receiving a portion of the meteorite for scientific study. \u201cBut there are so many meteorites coming out of the Sahara now that scientific institutions are overwhelmed,\u201d says Lauretta. \u201cIt would take us two years to analyse everything we have.\u201d So he and his colleagues have set up the Southwest Meteorite Center to buy samples of meteorites before they are divided up and disappear unrecorded into private collections. With an initial fund of about $200,000, the centre will buy meteorites wherever it can, as well as continuing to analyse rocks for dealers in return for samples. The researchers began the search for samples on 4 February at a meteorite auction held ahead of the annual Tucson Gem and Mineral Show, where the world's major players wheel and deal. \u201cIt was quite an adventure,\u201d said Lauretta, after appealing to a packed house of about 250 dealers and well-heeled customers. \u201cWe were very well received.\u201d The top sale of the day was $6,750 for a newly discovered 11-kilogram piece of the Brenham pallasite. This famous meteorite, which consists of olivine crystals in an iron\u2013nickel matrix, struck Kansas in 1882. The centre will also buy collections from private individuals, and is raising funds to create an endowment for future purchases. The samples will be stored in a climate-controlled facility and made available to scientists who want to study them. Long-time meteorite dealer Marvin Killgore of Payson, Arizona, will curate the repository.

A study claiming good news on Africa's fight against AIDS has reignited conflicts over the effectiveness of HIV prevention campaigns, particularly the merits of focusing on abstinence and monogamy. Researchers reported last week that HIV infection rates in Zimbabwe fell between 1998 and 2003 from 23% to 20.5% (S. Gregson  et al .  Science   311,  664\u2013666; 2006). They claimed that the gains came thanks to behavioural changes by Zimbabweans, who were having sex at a later age and with fewer partners. Women also reported more frequent condom use. Some scientists and government officials hailed the finding as showing that campaigns persuading people to change their behaviour can succeed. \u201cThis supports the idea that behavioural change has resulted in a reduction in new infections in this study population,\u201d says Richard Hayes, an epidemiologist at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. More controversially, US officials claim that the study validates their foreign policy. A third of US money spent on AIDS prevention overseas goes on programmes promoting abstinence and being faithful to one partner \u2014 the \u2018A\u2019 and \u2018B\u2019 in the \u2018ABC model\u2019, where \u2018C\u2019 stands for condoms. Critics say that focus is based on morality, not science, and can be unrealistic, especially for women who may have no choice about with whom they or their partners sleep. Deputy US global AIDS coordinator Mark Dybul says the Zimbabwe study and earlier gains in Uganda help to put such criticisms to rest. \u201cThe greatest behaviour change was in abstinence and fidelity,\u201d he points out. But Simon Gregson of Imperial College London, who led the Zimbabwe study, insists that \u201cwe need to be promoting all the different prevention possibilities\u201d. And some warn that other factors have been overlooked. Maria Wawer of Columbia University in New York, co-leader of a long-running study in Uganda, thinks deaths from AIDS play a role. Although prevention programmes deserve some credit, she says, \u201cthere's no reason to believe mortality is not contributing to this\u201d. After a decline in the late 1990s, HIV prevalence in Uganda now seems to be levelling off or even climbing back up. The drop in Zimbabwe could also have been affected by violence and unrest, which have escalated there since 2000. Epidemiologist Christopher Beyrer of Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland, says forced relocations and the departure of millions of young people seeking work may have skewed the study's results. \n                     HIV infection in Zimbabwe falls at last \n                   \n                     Uganda's HIV epidemic wanes \n                   \n                     2004 AIDS Special \n                   \n                     USAID strategy page on AIDS and HIV in Zimbabwe \n                   \n                     UNAIDS page on sub-Saharan Africa \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Editors of a journal launched this week are out to revolutionize peer review. By publishing signed reviews alongside papers, they hope to make the process more transparent and improve the quality of the articles. But although journal editors seem intrigued by the experiment, most say they'll take some persuading to change the traditional, anonymous system. At  Biology Direct , an open-access journal launched by BioMed Central on 6 February, manuscript editors and peer reviewers will, in effect, be merged into one editorial board. Prospective authors will approach board members and if three agree to review a paper, it will be accepted. Reviewers' comments will be signed and published with the final paper, along with responses by the author. An author has the right not to make suggested changes, but the suggestions will be there for anyone to see. An author who disagrees with the comments can retract the paper. Several journals, including the  BMJ  ( British Medical Journal ) and the  Medical Journal of Australia , have experimented with naming peer reviewers, but  Biology Direct  is going further by routinely posting those reviews as part of the paper. \u201cI like the direct relationship the author can have with a reviewer, and the transparency of the end result,\u201d says David Lipman, director of the US National Center for Biotechnology Information and one of the journal's lead editors.

Strife-torn Zimbabwe may have scored a blow against the deadly virus that causes AIDS. Researchers of the disease report that prevention programmes have cut the portion of Zimbabweans infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) by 2.5%. The news has inspired those hoping that education campaigns advising people to change their behaviours could turn back the scourge of AIDS in Africa. \"This is the first time we've had reliable, convincing evidence from southern Africa that HIV prevalence is beginning to fall,\" said Richard Hayes, an epidemiologist at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. \"This is very encouraging news.\"  Good news is sorely needed in the fight against AIDS in Africa where, according to the World Health Organization, about 25 million people are infected with HIV.  \n              Dangerous sex \n            Between 1998 and 2003, the researchers asked thousands of Zimbabweans questions about their sexual behaviours, and tested them for HIV infection.  During the five-year study, the researchers found that infection rates dropped from an average of 23% to 20.5%. The greatest reduction was seen in young people, who were waiting longer to have their first sexual encounter. And adults said they were having sex with fewer partners. Condom use by women during casual sex also went up from 26.2% to 36.5%; male condom use stayed at about 42% over the 5-year period. This combination of behavioural changes most likely led to the decline in infection, says Simon Gregson, a demographer at Imperial College London who conducted the study with colleagues from London, Zimbabwe and South Africa. Many other countries are employing similar strategies to try to change peoples' behaviours. \"Perhaps one of the most interesting things is that the greatest behaviour change was in abstinence and fidelity. The relative change in condom use was not as remarkable,\" says Mark Dybul, the Deputy US Global AIDS Coordinator.  But Gregson says it is important to note that all three types of behaviour change seem important in Zimbabwe. \"We need to be promoting all the different prevention possibilities,\" he says.  \n              Reason to hope \n            During the late 1990s, Uganda reported the continent's first signs of a drop in HIV-infection rates; rates of HIV infection in pregnant women reporting to health clinics later showed a decline (see ' Uganda's HIV epidemic wanes ').  The country's leaders attributed much of this success to their 'ABC' prevention strategy, which stands for abstinence, being faithful, and condom use. But others have worried that Uganda's apparent decline in HIV-infection rates may have been due to the death of infected individuals. There are now signs that the overall portion of Uganda's population infected with the virus is leveling off or even climbing back up. Hayes notes that the Zimbabwe study is based on a wide variety of men and women from different social and economic classes in twelve different towns. This makes it more robust than the previous indications of an HIV-infection decline.  He adds that as drugs to treat AIDS become more prevalent and affordable, health workers must be on their guard to ensure that people do not become complacent and revert to old habits. \"Other countries have seen a resurgence after the fall, so one has to work very rigorously to try and maintain these reductions,\" Hayes says. \"In the era of antiretroviral treatments, it's become more important, not less, to emphasize prevention.\" Post a comment to this story by visiting our  \n                 newsblog \n                . \n                   AIDS special \n                 \n                   WHO/UNAIDS AIDS Epidemic Update 2005 \n                 Reprints and Permissions"},

Munich A power struggle between the European Parliament and member states of the European Union (EU) threatens to delay the start date of the EU's next funding programme for research \u2014 and that of its new flagship funding agency, the European Research Council (ERC). In December, the EU's 25 heads of government agreed a total budget for 2007\u201313, including a 75% increase in research spending by 2013. If the money rises steadily over that period, the budget for the seventh EU Research Framework Programme (FP7) will be roughly \u20ac50 billion (US$60 billion). That's \u20ac20 billion less than originally proposed by the European Commission, which aimed to double research spending by 2013. A research-friendly majority in the European Parliament had also hoped for more. On 18 January, the parliament rejected the proposed EU budget by 541 votes to 56, forcing governments to renegotiate. \u201cWe don't reject the budget lock, stock and barrel,\u201d says Jorgo Chatzimarkakis, a liberal democrat MEP from Germany. \u201cBut we can't accept cuts in research that are disproportionately larger than in agriculture and structural funds.\u201d Although the possibility of an extra few billion euros for research may please Europe's science community, research managers fear continued political wrangling will lead to delays. Governments are unlikely to substantially revise the overall budget, which they agreed, after prolonged negotiations, just before the British EU presidency ended. So it is up to the commission to deliver a revised proposal for FP7. But insiders say departments are fighting over how to cope with the reduced budget. \u201cThe calendar for the adoption of FP7 is now extremely tight,\u201d Janez Poto\u010dnik, the EU's research commissioner, told a parliament committee on 26 January. \u201cIf we are to deliver a Framework programme in time for 2007...we must ensure that there are no delays on either side.\u201d \u201cThe commission had earmarked \u20ac1.5 billion per year for the ERC, which will fund basic research, but that figure is now unlikely. \u201c\u20ac1 billion per year is the absolute minimum required for the ERC to make sense,\u201d says Carl-Henrik Heldin, director of the Ludwig Institute of Cancer Research in Uppsala, Sweden. \u201cWe're anxious to get started in January, and get the first money paid out by the end of 2007.\u201d Peter Dr\u00f6ll, head of Poto\u010dnik's staff, says FP7 could make its schedule, provided the EU budget is approved by April. But that's far from certain. \u201cI reckon we'll need at least until the summer break,\u201d says Angelika Niebler, a Christian democrat MEP who acts as rapporteur for the ERC. \n                     Chairman explains Europe's research council \n                   \n                     Wanted: scientists to shape Europe's future research policy \n                   \n                     European research framework set to expand \n                   \n                     European Commission Research Directorate \n                   \n                     Community Research & Development Information Service (CORDIS) \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

The battered folio of notes looks like many others that have landed on the desk of Felix Pryor, manuscript expert at Bonhams auction house in London. But when he leafed through the pages of intricate seventeenth-century hand-writing, Pryor quickly realized he was looking at the most exciting scientific documents he had ever handled: a set of original minutes and commentary that detail the birth of modern science. \u201cMy jaw hit the floor,\u201d he says. The manuscripts are due to go on sale next month with an estimated value of \u00a31 million (US$1.8 million). They capture the early days of Britain's oldest research institution, the Royal Society, through the eyes of Robert Hooke \u2014 a brilliant physicist, chemist and mechanic who during his career engaged in well-documented rows with contemporaries such as Isaac Newton. Historians who have seen the papers say they settle a major controversy in the development of timekeeping and provide fascinating insights into the fledgling UK research body. Most of the notes date from Hooke's tenure as secretary of the society between 1677 and 1682, a time when Newton was developing his theory of gravity and Gottfried Leibniz was working on calculus. Transcriptions of Hooke's minutes, which record the group's weekly Thursday meetings, were printed at the time and survive to this day. But the discovery of the originals fills in several gaps created when the copies were made. A second section sheds light on a 300-year-old quarrel over the invention of the spring-balance watch, a major advance in timekeeping. The invention is often attributed to the Dutch physicist Christiaan Huygens, but Hooke always claimed that he had demonstrated the device at a Royal Society meeting in June 1670, five years before Huygens patented his. As the society's transcribed minutes make no mention of such a demonstration, many historians have questioned Hooke's claim. The notes may change that thinking. The second section was written by Hooke as he looked through original minutes handwritten by his predecessor as secretary, Henry Oldenburg. Hooke had removed a sheet of Oldenburg's minutes and placed it in his folio. It contains details of the pocket-watch experiment that Oldenburg never transcribed into the official records. \u201cHooke must have been incensed when he found it,\u201d says Lisa Jardine, a historian at Queen Mary, University of London, and a biographer of Hooke. Other parts of the manuscript suggest that Hooke was indeed furious. Oldenburg's printed minutes for 1676 omit another of Hooke's experiments, this time on magnetism. In his commentary, Hooke notes: \u201cThe dog has entred nothing but Left a blank.\u201d The documents were found last September in a cupboard in a house in Hampshire, southern England, during a routine valuation of other items. The owners say they have no idea how they came by the manuscript, and that it had been in the cupboard for as long as they can remember. Jardine and others say it is vital that the manuscript remains accessible after its sale, so that it can be properly studied by science historians. But there is no guarantee that will happen. The Royal Society says it wants to bid for the documents, but lacks the funds. \u201cI believe there is a lot of other serious stuff in there,\u201d says Jardine. \u201cI'm desperate that it goes to an accessible home.\u201d Should a foreign collector triumph in the auction, the UK government is likely to impose a three-month delay on issuing an export licence for the manuscript. Such a move would be designed to enable British museums to raise funds to mount a rival bid; UK law dictates that a museum could take possession if it matched the winning bid. \n                     Newton's religious screeds get online airing \n                   \n                     The Royal Society \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Researchers have found clues to what prion proteins might be doing when they are not triggering brain disease: it seems they help certain stem cells to copy themselves. Prion proteins can take two different forms: normal, and misfolded. When warped into an odd shape, they are thought to cause a family of debilitating brain conditions including bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), also known as mad cow disease, and variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) in humans.  Researchers have puzzled over what prions do in their other, healthy form. The fact that these are found throughout the bodies of mammals suggests that they are important. But bizarrely, mice genetically engineered to lack prion proteins seem to do fine without them. Harvey Lodish at the Whitehead Institute in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and his co-workers stumbled on one answer when studying mouse stem cells that divide to generate new blood cells. They found that many of these stem cells have prion proteins stuck all over their surfaces. The team shows that these prions help stem cells from the bone marrow to manufacture more and more new blood cells.  \n              Over the edge \n            To show this, the group effectively pushed the stem cells to the point of exhaustion, much as they might be in a person with anaemia or who had lost a lot of blood.  They transplanted the bone marrow stem cells into a mouse whose own bone marrow had been wiped out by radiation, so that the transplanted cells had to divide and replace the bone marrow and blood. They then took some of these fresh bone marrow cells, transplanted them into another mouse and continued to repeat the process.  Stem cells that lacked the prion protein wore out, and were unable to manufacture new cells, long before those that carried working prions. \"It's a first clue to what these proteins might do,\" Lodish says, who reports the findings in the  Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 1 .  \n              Helping hands \n            Lodish says he does not know exactly how the prions help stem cells to thrive. They might help them to stick inside the bone marrow, or perhaps help a hormone to tickle the cells into dividing. Prions could be doing a similar thing in brain cells, he suggests. Another idea is that the prions could protect the stem cells from damage, says Heather True-Krob who studies the proteins at Washington University in St Louis. This would back up some previous studies that suggest that prions safeguard nerve cells in the brain from stress and cell death. Mice lacking prion proteins might seem generally healthy because the body has back-up ways to compensate for their function. Only when the cells are under extreme stress, as they were in Lodish's experiments, would problems appear.  \n              Marriage of minds \n            If this idea holds up, then it could help us to understand what happens when prions go awry during vCJD and other diseases. Part of the problem could be because brain cells lose their protection and begin to die. The fact that abnormal prions multiply and accumulate into toxic clumps may also contribute to the disease. By figuring out what prions are normally doing, researchers might ultimately help to tackle the diseases caused when they go wrong, True-Krob says. They might, for example, find other molecules that can protect brain cells when the prions cannot. It is surprising to see prion biology and stem cell biology, two of the hottest areas of research, collide in this way, Lodish says. \"That's why science is wonderful,\" he says, \"you're working in one area and suddenly you find yourself working in another.\" \n             Post a comment to this story by visiting our  \n             \n                 newsblog \n               \n           \n                   Stem cells In Focus \n                 \n                   CDC: BSE \n                 \n                   Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research \n                 Reprints and Permissions"},

But recent scandals mean that journals are looking at other ways to detect fabricated papers. Emma Marris investigates. The scientific community is sunk in one of its periodic bouts of angst over research fraud. After the Korean researcher Woo Suk Hwang's cloning work turned out to be spectacularly false, recent weeks have brought revelations that range from spurious Norwegians in a cancer study to doubts over RNA work in Japan (see  page 514 ). With high-profile cases putting the reputations of journals \u2014 and science as a whole \u2014 on the line, is there more that editors can or should do to prevent such embarrassments? Whenever a published paper is exposed as a fake, editors are wont to repeat that peer review is not capable of catching fraudulent science. After a Norwegian study published in  The Lancet  was found to be based on imaginary patients (see  Nature   439 , 248\u2013249; 200610.1038/439248b ), the journal's editor, Richard Horton, pointed out: \u201cShort of me flying to Oslo and checking out every entry on the computer, there is really no way for me to detect the fraud.\u201d And other groups seem to agree that the primary responsibility for determining whether a paper ought to be shelved in fiction or non-fiction should not rest with journals. This opinion is based partly on the patchy staffing and funding of most journals, which are volunteer-run society publications. \u201cJournals don't have the resources or the expertise,\u201d says Mary Scheetz, director of extramural research at the Maryland-based Office of Research Integrity, which investigates ethical violations in work funded by the US National Institutes of Health. In addition, journals have very little disciplinary power \u2014 the worst they can do is refuse to publish work, or publish a retraction. The responsibility for investigating allegations lies mainly with institutions and funding agencies that pay for the work, points out James Kroll, who examines misconduct at the US National Science Foundation. But in the past few years, journal editors have been taking a more proactive approach to dealing with fraud, and exploring what they can do with the resources they have. Examining every paper submitted for fabrication would be pretty much impossible. \u201cIt would be an astronomically expensive and difficult thing,\u201d says Drummond Rennie, deputy editor of the  Journal of the American Medical Association . \u201cIt would take months; we are talking hundreds of thousands, and sometimes millions of dollars.\u201d Stephen Evans, a statistician at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, occasionally analyses papers in which the raw data are suspect. Tricks include looking for \u2018digit preference\u2019, the tendency of humans to round towards 0s and 5s, or the amount of variance in the data. \u201cIt is very difficult to invent data that has the right variability,\u201d says Evans. But he agrees that the time and expense make checking every study \u201ctotally impractical\u201d. Instead, journals are investigating the potential of automated computer searches on submitted data, which could be incorporated into the review process with minimal time and effort. One idea catching hold is the introduction of screens to catch unacceptable image manipulation (see  \u2018Forensic software traces tweaks to images\u2019 ). Editors are also exploring text-comparison software to help pick up plagiarism (see  Nature   435 , 258\u2013259; 2005). \u201cAs information technology becomes more sophisticated, I think you are going to see more journals adding new tools to their screening processes,\u201d says Scheetz. Another shift is that journal editors are now more likely to challenge papers that they think are suspicious, rather than quietly rejecting them. According to Harvey Marcovitch, head of the London-based Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE), the old way was to \u201cfind some excuse not to publish it\u201d. But the 200 or so journals that have signed up to COPE's code of conduct are now committed to going further. \u201cEven if you wouldn't accept a paper if it was completely clean, you have an absolute duty to inquire,\u201d says Marcovitch. \u201cIf you are not satisfied with the authors' responses, you have an absolute duty to go to the institution and ask them to investigate it.\u201d Most would agree with that sentiment, but there are practical problems. In Britain, for example, editors are particularly loath to accuse anyone of fraud because the country's tough libel laws mean that they risk being taken to court. \u201cOften what you do is ask for more and more clarification in the hope that something will turn up,\u201d says Marcovitch. A common step is to request the raw data, although this can be a headache for journals. \u201cWhat do you do if you are suspicious about a paper, you ask to see the data and you get 25 cardboard boxes, 4 CDs and would have to hire a biostatistician for three months?\u201d asks Marcovitch. One simple step \u2014 which Scheetz says is taken surprisingly seldom \u2014 is to include misconduct policies in a journal's instructions to authors. \u201cIf something is suspicious, it puts the journal in a stronger position. Editors can request the raw data if it says they can in the instructions to authors,\u201d she explains. Journals are also starting to request that researchers carry out their own checks before even submitting a paper.  Nature  now advises authors to include independent verification for certain cloning papers, for example. And the  Journal of the American Medical Association  requires that industry-funded trials go through independent data analysis. Journals are increasingly developing policies together, through programmes such as COPE, or using common policies drafted by groups such as the World Association of Medical Editors, based in Chicago, Illinois. The US Council of Science Editors, in Reston, Virginia, is currently working on a report on publication ethics. And  Nature ,  Science  and  Cell  are thinking about working up policies between them, according to Linda Miller, US executive editor of  Nature . Ultimately, if a journal does uncover evidence of fraud, it has to rely on the researchers' institution or funding agency to investigate fully. But this depends on such bodies having the will and authority to do so. When the  British Medical Journal  tried to get someone to investigate the work of cardiologist Ram Singh of Haldberg Hospital and Research Institute in Moradabad, India, for example, no institution or scientific body could be persuaded to make a judgment on the case. Singh went on to publish similar work in  The Lancet . In the end, both journals published expressions of concern, but did not feel able to retract the papers. And in an ongoing case involving RNA researcher Kazunari Taira, the University of Tokyo seems unlikely to get to the bottom of whether suspicious data were faked, because it does not have the authority to make a full inquiry. \n                     Rise and fall \n                   \n                     Verdict: Hwang's human stem cells were all fakes \n                   \n                     Timeline of a controversy \n                   \n                     Scientists behaving badly \n                   \n                     Special Report: Taking on the cheats \n                   \n                     Image manipulation: CSI: cell biology \n                   \n                     Woo Suk Hwang special \n                   \n                     The Committee on Publication Ethics \u2013 Seminar 2006 \n                   \n                     The Office of Research Integrity \n                   \n                     International Committee of Medical Journal Editors \u2013 Uniform Requirements for Manuscripts Submitted to Biomedical Journals \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Tokyo An experiment published by biochemist Kazunari Taira is not reproducible, a University of Tokyo committee has concluded. The announcement, made on 27 January, vindicated many scientists who have challenged Taira's work. But the ongoing investigation is raising more questions than it answers, as the committee seems unlikely to uncover what lies behind the invalid result, or address many of Taira's other papers, at least 12 of which have been questioned. Many in Japan are now calling for clearer guidelines to cover how universities should respond to cases of suspected fraud. Taira is known for his work on RNA interference, in which small pieces of RNA intercept and regulate the process by which genes are turned into proteins. The molecules block specific genes, and are a powerful tool for studying gene function. Clinical use of the molecules to block the development of certain diseases is also getting under way. Taira's work is not considered central to the promise of the technology. But so many scientists were trying \u2014 and failing \u2014 to repeat his work that the RNA Society of Japan became concerned. In April 2005, after several complaints from members, the society asked the University of Tokyo to examine 12 papers written by Taira and his team, including two  Nature  papers, one of which had already been retracted and the other corrected (H. Kawasaki and K. Taira  Nature   423 , 838\u2013842; 2003 and H. Kawasaki and K. Taira  Nature   431 , 211\u2013217; 2004). The university set up a committee of internal and external experts to investigate. It asked Taira for raw data but he claimed that another author on the papers, Hiroaki Kawasaki, could not locate the proper notebooks. So the committee asked Taira to redo experiments described in four of the twelve papers by the end of December (see  Nature   437 , 461; 200510.1038/437461b ). In a report submitted to the committee on 13 January, Taira said his team had reproduced one of these experiments, from a paper in  Nucleic Acids Research  (H. Kawasaki, E. Suyama, M. Iyo and K. Taira  31,  981\u2013987; 2003). In that study, a human enzyme that can cut long RNA molecules into shorter pieces, useful for RNA interference, is expressed and activated in the bacterium  Escherichia coli . But the committee rejected the replicated result, partly because its own findings suggested that the experiment used different materials from those in the original work. An external company asked by Taira to repeat the test was also unable to activate the enzyme. Taira, who denies any wrongdoing on his part, saying that he is not capable of performing such \u201ctechnical\u201d experiments, blames Kawasaki for the discrepancies. At a press conference on 27 January, a dejected Kawasaki spoke up only to say that the inconsistencies were just a matter of mislabelling. He has denied any wrongdoing. Taira told  Nature  on Friday that he would not retract the paper, but will continue the tests. He is also trying to confirm experiments from a second paper; efforts to reproduce the third and fourth experiments haven't yet started. Yoichiro Matsumoto, head of the investigation committee, says it will produce a final report in March. Another university committee may now meet to discuss possible disciplinary actions. But although Taira's credibility has suffered, a full investigation to determine whether fraud was involved is unlikely, because there is no clear legal authority for the university to carry one out. Without concrete evidence, \u201cwe could get sued,\u201d says Matsumoto. Most countries either have a governmental oversight body to deal with possible fraud, or research institutions have guidelines in place to determine how to proceed. Akira Yoshikawa, director of the science ministry's Science and Technology Policy Bureau, says that it is unlikely that Taira or Kawasaki will be investigated for criminal fraud \u2014 that is, for seeking funds based on research they knew to be fake \u2014 because the results so far have been \u201cgrey\u201d. The situation is in stark contrast to the intense investigation that South Korea's Seoul National University (SNU) recently completed into the work of cloning researcher Woo Suk Hwang (see  Nature   439 , 122\u2013123; 200610.1038/439122a ). There, the SNU conducted independent tests. The investigation team shut down Hwang's lab, examined notebooks and other materials, and conducted in-depth interviews, to reach a firm conclusion within a few weeks. Jung-Hye Roe, head of research at SNU, says that although there was no clear legal framework in South Korea either, the university president gave the committee \u201cfull authority\u201d to investigate \u2014 an unprecedented move motivated by a petition of university scientists. The situation in Japan leaves researchers in the field uncertain about the merits of much of Taira's work. For example, Kunihiro Matsumoto, a biologist at Nagoya University, tried using Taira's technology to block gene activity, but failed to make it work. \u201cI don't know if the problem is the technology or the genes we used,\u201d he says. Many in Japan are now calling for clearer guidelines on dealing with fraud. In response to the Taira case, the government's Council for Science and Technology Policy says it will consider measures, although it's not clear yet what those would be. And the science ministry says a committee will report on the issue by the summer. But neither is considering creating an independent body, such as the US Office of Research Integrity. \u201cIn some countries there is a government office to take care of such things, says Yoshikawa. But in Japan, we are already trying to cut back the number of government officials. The last thing we want to do is open up a new office.\u201d \n                     Induction of DNA methylation and gene silencing by short interfering RNAs in human cells \n                   \n                     Hes1 is a target of microRNA-23 during retinoic-acid-induced neuronal differentiation of NT2 cells \n                   \n                     RNAi in focus \n                   \n                     RNAi Therapy collection \n                   \n                     Woo Suk Hwang special \n                   \n                     RNA Society of Japan \n                   \n                     The Taira Lab, University of Tokyo \n                   \n                     Kazunari Taira, University of Tokyo \n                   \n                     Council for Science and Technology Policy, Japan \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

The driving force behind the project is ManyOne, a company headed by Joseph Firmage, who made a fortune in the 1990s from an Internet consulting company. He resigned in 1999 after the fallout from his book claiming that he had encountered extraterrestrials. Firmage says he vehemently opposes the \u201canyone can edit\u201d vision of Wikipedia. \u201cWikipedia is a very uninviting place for most intellectuals,\u201d he adds. \u201cI myself would not want to be writing articles that could be edited by somebody who does not necessarily have any expertise.\u201d He hopes that peer-reviewed content will raise the standard of content on the web, which he describes as having \u201can intellectual deficiency of serious proportions\u201d. \u201cThe Digital Universe is an attempt to massively mobilize the scientific community,\u201d adds Cutler Cleveland, director of the Center for Energy and Environmental Studies at Boston University and editor of the Digital Universe's Earth Portal and other portals on Earth's environment. \u201cThe information you see here you will know is trustworthy in a fundamental way.\u201d Many are enthusiastic. The US National Council for Science and the Environment, the University of California, Berkeley, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the University of Oxford and the World Resources Institute have all signed up to help. The Digital Universe's Earth Portal, which is to be released next month, has contributors that include Gene Likens, the discoverer of acid rain, Thomas Kunz, a top bat expert, and Robert Costanza, founder of the field of ecological economics. Its international advisory board includes Rita Colwell, former director of the US National Science Foundation. Critics interviewed by  Nature  were unwilling to speak on the record. But some believe that the project is over-complicated, and that much of its underlying technology \u2014 which still requires significant development \u2014 runs against the trend to distribute information in lightweight formats that can be accessed by cell phones or PDAs such as the BlackBerry. \u201cIf you have to rely on a high-bandwidth always-on network environment, on devices with a lot of storage, you are pretty much going in the wrong direction,\u201d says one critic, an expert in Internet information systems. He is also unimpressed by the Digital Universe's concept of peer-reviewing material. \u201cThere's more than enough content on the web, even substantive content,\u201d he says. \u201cI'm not sure that generating new content is really a breakthrough.\u201d There are also questions over the business model, in which revenue would largely come from selling high-speed Internet access, with half the profits fed back into the work. \u201cIt's an odd choice; that's a dying business,\u201d comments one observer familiar with the project, pointing out that in the future consumers will be unlikely to notice where their Internet access comes from. But he says he can't help being inspired by the idea. \u201cThey're trying to package science in a way that has some of the glitz and entertainment appeal of television, but that is also complete and correct,\u201d he says. \u201cThey're not in it for the money; actually, they're trying to save the world.\u201d \n               \n                   http://www.digitaluniverse.net \n                 \n             \n                     Internet encyclopaedias go head to head \n                   \n                     Digital universe \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Biologists have overlooked problems with a decades-old technique for marking cells, warn US researchers. They say their findings call into question some studies of adult stem cells. The dispute is part of an ongoing and heated debate within the stem-cell community about whether adult stem cells extracted from one tissue, such as bone marrow, can spawn the cell types of a different tissue, and so be used to repair damage caused by disease. Cell biologists have long relied on a technique called thymidine labelling, whereby a group of chemicals such as bromodeoxy-uridine (BrdU) are incorporated into the DNA of dividing cells. In some studies, BrdU is used to mark cells splitting at a particular time, allowing researchers to later examine where those cells migrated and what new cell types they generated. Often, stem cells are extracted from one tissue, marked with BrdU and then transplanted into a second tissue, such as the brain. Now a team led by Catherine Verfaillie at the University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, is raising a red flag over the method. The group found evidence suggesting that many thymidine-labelled stem cells die after being transplanted into the brains of mice, and then release the chemical, which is taken up by neighbouring cells that are also dividing. This means that cells normally resident in the tissue could become marked and mistaken for transplanted cells. The results were first published online in December 2005 (T. C. Burns  et al .  Stem Cells  doi:10.1634/stemcells.2005-0463; 2005). \u201cHopefully, this will serve as a long-overdue wake-up call that will illustrate how misleading thymidine labelling can be,\u201d says Verfaillie. Certain investigators who have used the method for many years say they already run rigorous control experiments that should avoid potential problems. One method is to transplant dead cells labelled with BrdU and compare the results to those obtained with live cells. Many researchers also use additional techniques to label their transplanted cells, such as green fluorescent protein (GFP), which is thought to be a reliable cell marker. Even so, some experts say thymidine-labelling is so commonplace that biologists may be blas\u00e9 about potential pitfalls and skimp on the controls. \u201cIt's important to have a caution about these issues,\u201d says neurobiologist Fred Gage at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in San Diego, California. Verfaillie says that the problems with BrdU could potentially affect any type of cell. But her study has focused on adult bone-marrow stem cells. Several researchers have reported that certain stem cells extracted from adult bone marrow and transplanted into the brains of mice can transform into new neurons or their supporting glial cells \u2014 fuelling the idea that these cells could repair brain disease or damage. Verfaillie says some of these results might be experimental artefacts, and that researchers should double-check their results: \u201cIn our hands it's all false positives,\u201d she says. \n               Cause to question \n             A study by Donald Phinney at Tulane University, New Orleans, on the properties of bone-marrow stem cells (G. C. Kopen, D. J. Prockop and D. G. Phinney  Proc. Natl Acad. Sci.   96,  10711\u201310716; 1999), is among those questioned in Verfaillie's paper. Phinney counters that since Verfaillie's study, many groups, using different techniques, have independently reported that transplanted bone-marrow stem cells acquire properties of neurons and glial cells, and questions whether the phenomenon Verfaillie's team saw could be unique to their experiments. \u201cI think it'll be controversial and raise the ire of a lot of people,\u201d he says. There are additional, overlooked hazards of using BrdU, warns neuroscientist Pasko Rakic of Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut. One study from his lab showed that an injury can trigger neurons in the brain to start synthesizing new DNA, and that these cells can also take up the marker even though they are not actually dividing (C.-Y. Kuan  et al .  J. Neurosci.   24,  10763\u201310772; 2004). A second study from another lab also suggested that BrdU could boost the ability of bone-marrow stem cells to generate new cell types. This implies that some of the properties previously attributed to the cells may actually have been triggered by the chemical altering gene activity (T. Y. Qu  et al .  Rest. Neurol. Neurosci.   22,  459\u2013468; 2004). Such findings highlight the need for a broad rethink about how best to label transplanted cells, says Kenneth Chien, who studies heart stem cells at the University of California, San Diego. Biologists need \u201ca more rigorous tool kit\u201d, he says \u2014 a repertoire of cellular markers that can unequivocally distinguish which cells have been transplanted, whether they are alive and precisely what they become. \n                     Stem-cell therapies: The first wave \n                   \n                     Stem-cell research: After the gold rush \n                   \n                     The heart of the matter \n                   \n                     Stem cell hopes double \n                   \n                     Stem-cell powers challenged \n                   \n                     Stem Cells in focus \n                   \n                     Catherine Verfaillie, University of Minnesota \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

The editors of scientific journals could catch fraudulent images by using computer tools similar to those being developed for law enforcement and photojournalism, say computer scientists. Recent fraud at the lab of stem-cell researcher Woo Suk Hwang ( Nature   439 , 122\u2013123; 200610.1038/439122a ) highlights the ease with which scientists can cook up fake images. In the South Korean team's 2005  Science  paper, for example, two photographs in the same figure were found to be partial duplications. The Hwang furore is encouraging journal editors to seek ways of detecting suspicious images before they are ever published. Such screening could identify outright fraud, as well as a far more pervasive practice in which biologists use programs such as Photoshop to tweak and smarten scientific images before publication (see  Nature   434 , 952\u2013953; 2005). At least one group of journals, published by the Rockefeller University Press (RUP), already carries out such image forensics by eye. Mike Rossner, managing editor of the  Journal of Cell Biology  in New York City, has trained a production editor to enlarge and scrutinize images for obvious but illegitimate changes, such as bands erased from a gel or cells slipped into a microscope image. This production editor checks manuscripts accepted for publication at the  Journal of Cell Biology  and two other RUP journals. But this is time consuming, and computer scientists say that computer algorithms could automatically scan digital images and ferret out signs of manipulation. The development of such systems, prompted by the explosive spread of digital cameras and imaging programs, is also of interest to lawyers and police, who want to check for tampered crime-scene images, as well as to news organizations keen to detect faked photos. Partly funded by the FBI, Hany Farid at Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire, and his colleagues have designed a suite of ten mathematical techniques to scan images for the hallmarks of manipulation. For example, one algorithm searches for small clusters of identical pixels in an image, and so might reveal where an area of background has been copied and pasted over a blemish. A second algorithm can identify whether part of an image has been expanded, perhaps to splice two photos seamlessly together. To do this, a program such as Photoshop generates new pixels by averaging the characteristics of the neighbouring ones \u2014 leaving a giveaway signature in the image. Farid is currently converting his algorithms into a user-friendly form that can be attached to ImageJ, a free image-processing program distributed by the US National Institutes of Health. He is also consulting Adobe, the company that makes Photoshop, about whether the algorithms could be packaged together as a plug-in for the program, for use by different industries. This could help journal editors and reviewers, but also lab heads wanting to check the work of their team. Rossner says he plans to trial Farid's system when it is complete. Editors at  Nature  are also consulting researchers about automatic tools for detecting image manipulation. But there are drawbacks. Such a system could act only as a first line of policing to flag up suspicious images. And editors and technophiles alike agree that anyone determined to fabricate or alter images will be able to fool the forensics software \u2014 perhaps by using the very same detection algorithms to learn how.

German space officials were pressing NASA last week to honour US commitment to the SOFIA (Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy) project, following rumours that the agency may pull funding for the airborne observatory before its first flight. SOFIA, which has been in the planning stage for more than two decades, will place a 2.5-metre telescope \u2014 similar in size to the Hubble Space Telescope \u2014 onboard a modified 747 aeroplane. This will fly above most of the water vapour in the atmosphere that blocks incoming infrared radiation. A successor to the Kuiper Airborne Observatory that flew until 1995, SOFIA bridges the gap between ground-based telescopes and infrared satellites such as the Spitzer Space Telescope. NASA will pay 80% of the bill, or about $500 million, as well as most of the operational costs, with Germany supplying the telescope. The first test flight of the long-delayed project was scheduled for this October, with science flights beginning in 2008. But at the American Astronomical Society meeting in Washington DC last month, project scientists heard rumours that NASA planned to eliminate funding for SOFIA in 2006 and 2007, with an eye to killing the project outright. David Black, president of the Universities Space Research Association in Columbia, Maryland, which manages SOFIA for NASA, says the information came from many sources and is credible enough to be taken seriously. NASA spokeswoman Erica Hupp says the agency will not comment on SOFIA's status until the agency's 2007 budget request is unveiled on 6 February. Alarmed by what they heard, German space officials last week complained to their NASA counterparts. Sigmar Wittig, chairman of the board for the German Aerospace Center, DLR, pleaded SOFIA's case with NASA administrator Mike Griffin, as well as with deputy administrator Shana Dale, who was in Germany conferring with science ministers and legislators. \u201cThe German card has been played,\u201d says Reinhard Genzel of the Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics in Garching, a co-investigator for one of SOFIA's planned science instruments. \u201cWe've made very clear how important this is to us.\u201d The German investment of nearly US$100 million in SOFIA makes it the country's largest collaborative space project outside the European Space Agency. The German pressure, along with queries to NASA from members of the US Congress, may already have had an effect. \u201cThey're still working on it within NASA,\u201d says astrophysicist Eric Becklin of the University of California, Los Angeles, the SOFIA chief scientist. Although he was \u201cprepared for the worst\u201d earlier last month, Becklin now says of NASA's budget request: \u201cWe don't really know what's going to come.\u201d Cancelling such a high-profile project so late in its development would be highly unusual. But NASA science managers are desperate to contain costs these days, and SOFIA's 20-year operational budget would make a tempting target. Having added substantially to the project's staff at NASA's Ames Research Center in California \u2014 partly to satisfy government-imposed safety requirements for flying the 747 \u2014 NASA is facing a lifetime operational budget for SOFIA that could top $1 billion. \u201cWe are definitely looking at ways to cut the operations budget,\u201d says Becklin. \n                     Airborne telescope delayed as plane is made ready \n                   \n                     SOFIA project \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Washington DC The United States is losing its scientific edge and needs billions of extra dollars to rekindle innovation, according to a bipartisan group of US senators. After years of growth in areas such as biomedical research, funding at US science agencies is now mostly flat or decreasing, and critics charge that the nation's competitiveness will soon suffer. The senators' solution consists of three new bills that would dramatically increase the number of science teachers nationwide, boost funding for research, and increase tax breaks for industrial research and development. \u201cThis is a basic problem that America faces and that everybody in the US Senate ought to be totally committed to solving,\u201d said Senator Pete Domenici (Republican, New Mexico), unveiling the bills on 25 January. The other sponsors of the legislation are Democrats Jeff Bingaman (New Mexico) and Barbara Mikulski (Maryland), and Republican Lamar Alexander (Tennessee). The legislation, collectively dubbed the Protecting America's Competitive Edge (PACE) Act, recommends spending US$9.5 billion in the first year alone. That money would go towards hiring some 10,000 science and maths teachers, creating a crash programme for advanced energy research, and boosting funding by 10% at agencies such as the National Science Foundation, the Department of Energy and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Over the long term, the PACE Act recommends doubling the budget of these and other research offices, as well as providing research tax credits for industry and incentives for students who take a bachelor's degree in science, maths or engineering. The legislation is an attempt to implement the recommendations made in a report by the National Academies, which was released last October and warned that other countries were threatening US scientific dominance (see  Nature   437 , 1208; 2005). Not surprisingly, science advocates were almost universally enthusiastic about the proposed legislation. \u201cWe're excited about it,\u201d says Gerald Wheeler, executive director of the National Science Teachers Association in Arlington, Virginia. \u201cWe're creating the engine that's going to get us out of this crisis.\u201d But others are more cautious about the bills' prospects. Sam Rankin, president of the Coalition for National Science Funding in Washington DC, notes that the PACE Act would only recommend spending levels.

They will deposit the information in linked databases. Meyer hopes this will give scientists more information than barcoding a single DNA sequence. \u201cBarcoding is great, and a lot of people are excited about it, but it can only answer questions about one narrow space,\u201d Meyer says. \u201cWe intend to fill our data set with additional information so that we can answer a broader set of questions.\u201d The Biocode team will meet next month to begin designing databases. Meanwhile, entomologist Rosie Gillespie \u2014 based, like Davies, at the University of California, Berkeley \u2014 will begin collecting insects on Moorea and sequencing their DNA. Then, in March, French icthyologist Serge Planes of Perpignan University will start sampling fish from Moorea's reefs; he hopes to collect 80% of the 600 fish species in four-and-a-half weeks. Researchers intend to start using these data immediately to look at topics from invasive species to biodiversity. Nancy Knowlton, a coral-reef expert not involved with the Biocode project, says such data could resolve many unanswered questions. For instance, she says, it is often hard to identify tropical reef fishes, many of which have been described only in small journals. Having a DNA code linked to a visual key could help biologists to make quicker, more accurate identifications. And that could help them to understand crucial parts of reef ecosystems, such as how many species live on them and how well they are doing. \u201cOur estimate of the number of species on reefs rests on incredibly shaky ground,\u201d says Knowlton, who directs the Center for Marine Biodiversity and Conservation at Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla, California. \u201cThese molecular tools have the potential to help us fine-tune those estimates to get a total sense of diversity, and what we're losing as the reefs degrade.\u201d The Biocode scientists also want to learn about the general properties of ecosystems. Moorea is less diverse than other islands farther east, so it may serve as a reference site that can be compared with more complex systems in Australia, Papua New Guinea and southeast Asia. \u201cIt's like comparing the processes of  Caenorhabditis elegans  with humans; that's a very powerful approach,\u201d says Davies. Moorea is a logical choice for a model system of ecology, experts say, because it has been well studied by researchers at two field stations there for decades. The project can also tap into other, similar efforts that are already under way, such as the Census of Marine Life, in which Knowlton is involved. Putting a whole island under the microscope won't be easy. But the Biocode scientists say they are building on a tide of change that is revolutionizing taxonomy and ecology. \u201cWe have technological challenges; we have sampling challenges,\u201d Meyer admits. \u201cBut the idea of barcoding has really hit a tipping point. This is the perfect time to try something like this.\u201d \n                     Cowrie study strikes a blow for traditional taxonomy \n                   \n                     DNA barcoding a useful tool for taxonomists \n                   \n                     DNA barcoding does not compete with taxonomy \n                   \n                     DNA barcoding is no substitute for taxonomy \n                   \n                     Marine survey sees net gain in number of fish species \n                   \n                     University of California, Berkeley's Moorea Research Station \n                   \n                     French Research Station, Moorea \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Observatories in Chile and Mexico are vying to host a new kind of astronomical facility, which, if approved, will set the standard for sensitive all-sky surveys in the next decade. The Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) corporation, based in Tucson, Arizona, has asked for proposals from astronomers at three sites chosen for their excellent visibility: Las Campanas and Cerro Pach\u00f3n in Chile, and San Pedro M\u00e1rtir in Mexico. The winning site will be announced in April. The LSST's ambitious goal is a kind of \u201ccelestial cinematograph\u201d, says project director Tony Tyson of the University of California, Davis. A single 8.4-metre telescope will photograph the entire sky every three days, across a range of wavelengths from ultraviolet to near-infrared. The survey will pick up far fainter objects than today's Sloan Digital Sky Survey, and LSST images could be used for a range of astronomical problems, from searching for dark matter to tracking fast-moving asteroids. The volume of data generated will be unprecedented \u2014 20 terabytes of raw image data, more than the entire Sloan Survey's output, every night. Tyson sees the LSST as a \u201ctotally different paradigm\u201d for astronomy, akin to the Human Genome Project. All the data will be shared freely, as will the algorithms for image processing. He says the project is now spending most of its time on software development, and recently used Wayne Rosing, Google's former senior vice-president of engineering, as a consultant. Private funding has allowed work to begin on the mirrors, and the National Science Foundation (NSF) is providing US$14.2 million over four years. Still, that's far from the $270 million needed for construction and a decade of operations. Tyson hopes the US Department of Energy and the NSF will contribute roughly $100 million each, with the rest coming from private sources. The Chilean sites already have several premier telescopes, including the Gemini and SOAR (Southern Astrophysical Research Telescope) on Cerro Pach\u00f3n and the Magellan telescopes on Las Campanas. The San Pedro M\u00e1rtir site in the Mexican state of Baja California is less well known; its largest instrument is a modest 2.1 metres in diameter. But the remoteness of the Mexican site could be a bonus; the Chilean observatories have had to contend with light pollution as the population builds up in nearby communities. The \u2018astro-climate\u2019 for the three sites \u2014 which includes factors from atmospheric transparency and stability to the number of clear nights per year \u2014 is virtually identical, says Tyson.

But there are doubts over the theories being used, as Quirin Schiermeier explains. Discussions of climate change tend to involve uncertainties, and most climate researchers have come to accept the inherent unknowns of their business. After all, the climate models they use to project the course of global warming are generally seen as the best that science can offer. But there is a growing feeling that the economic assumptions on which their work is based are outdated and unreliable. And this could have serious implications for assessments of climate change. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which coordinates efforts to predict the effects of global warming, is currently finalizing its fourth assessment report. It has asked 15 climate groups to run their models using output from a range of different \u2018scenarios\u2019, representing various assumptions about energy use, economic development and population increase up to 2100. For the different models to be compared, all groups will run two of the 40 available scenarios \u2014 A1B, which describes a world with large economic growth and a balance between fossil and renewable energy sources, and B1, which assumes less economic growth and a large shift towards renewable energy. Each group will also run a selection of other scenarios. The results will be fed into the report of the IPCC's Working Group I, which projects how temperatures may rise over the next century. Working Group II will translate this into likely effects on society, income, food security and disease, and Working Group III will assess the options for limiting greenhouse-gas emissions and mitigating climate change. The scenarios were described in the IPCC's \u201cSpecial Report on Emissions Scenarios\u201d (SRES) for the panel's 2001 third assessment report. In June 2003, the IPCC decided that there was no time to develop new scenarios for its fourth assessment report, so the same ones are being used again. But many economists are vehemently questioning the assumptions on which the SRES scenarios are based. They say the scenarios rely on outdated economic theories and fail to reflect how lifestyle and energy demand in both rich and poor countries are likely to change. Climate researchers are familiar with the problem. \u201cSome emissions scenarios are perhaps already demonstrably wrong,\u201d says Erich Roeckner, a climate modeller at the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology in Hamburg, Germany, who has modelled three of them for the IPCC (see  \u201cEarly results\u201d ). \u201cIt is possible that all of them are wrong.\u201d But most feel that economics is a field they are not qualified to assess. \n               Ridiculous assumption? \n             One key criticism is the assumption that the economies of poor countries will quickly catch up with those of rich nations. \u201cIt is ridiculous to assume, as the IPCC does, that rich and poor countries will economically converge as rapidly as the European Union has done over the past 40 years,\u201d says Richard Tol, an economist at Princeton University in New Jersey. A particular worry about convergence was first raised by David Henderson, former head of economics at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, and Ian Castles, former head of Australia's bureau of statistics, after the IPCC's third assessment report. They pointed out that the IPCC used market exchange rates to compare the wealth of different countries, instead of what a certain amount of money will buy in each place. This exaggerates the differences between countries, they argue, and overestimates how much poor countries will develop in coming decades, and how much their carbon emissions will increase. Tol says that even if certain economic assumptions are wrong, the predictions of global warming itself may not be far off. The errors may even cancel each other out: if economic development is slower than thought, countries may also switch to renewable energy more slowly. Susan Solomon, who chairs the IPCC's Working Group I, emphasizes this point. \u201cExisting scenarios cover a very wide range of emissions trajectories,\u201d she says. \u201cThey are perfectly suited to physical tests of how the climate responds to fixed concentrations of greenhouse gas. In the simplified view of science it does not matter how the gas gets into the atmosphere, only how much of it is there.\u201d But Tol argues that when it comes to translating those temperature predictions into impacts on society, how the carbon got there matters very much indeed. Many problems relating to climate change, such as the distribution of malaria and water-borne diseases, are highly sensitive to development and wealth, says Tol. \u201cYou can't use flawed economic scenarios for any meaningful analysis of the impacts of climate change.\u201d In terms of human welfare, some even assert that the difference between the economic effects of the various scenarios is more significant than the predicted effects of climate change. For example, changes in malaria incidence that result from people becoming rich enough to have mosquito nets outweigh any changes in the geographical spread of malaria caused by global warming. Development of the SRES scenarios was overseen by Nebojsa Nakicenovic, an energy economist at Vienna Technical University in Austria. He says he is aware of the criticisms, but argues that the scenarios were designed to cover a range of possibilities, and include one group that assumes little convergence. Martin Parry, co-chair of Working Group II, which met in Merida, Mexico, last week to consider an early draft of the fourth assessment report, adds that he and his colleagues also take other projections into account, for example those from the World Bank or the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment. But which ones are likely to be right isn't for them to judge, says Parry. \u201cThe IPCC summarizes current knowledge \u2014 it does not have a view.\u201d But economists such as Tol say that instead of considering an ever wider range of possibilities, the IPCC needs to rethink its scenarios and come up with a selection of likely options based on more up-to-date economic theory. Tol believes that the composition of the SRES teams was too narrow, and that future efforts should have a wide range of experts. As well as convergence, they will need to consider how future societies will operate, how fast the population will grow, and how technological progress will change things. \u201cAll these questions are at the heart of economics,\u201d agrees Ottmar Edenhofer, an economist at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany. Edenhofer says that economists must also routinely check their ideas against historical data, and test their predictions against those of other teams, as climate scientists do. The way natural scientists compare their models \u201cis a totally new thing in economics\u201d, says Edenhofer. \u201cWe can learn a lot from climate modellers.\u201d The aim is to develop flexible theories, in which variables such as gross domestic product and technical progress influence one another, to test the effects of policy interventions \u2014 emissions caps or trading, for example \u2014 and work out the cost of different policies. A few attempts have already been completed. In 2003, economists Michael Grubb of Imperial College London and Carlo Carraro of the University of Venice, along with John Schellnhuber, research director at the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research in Norwich, UK, launched a project to investigate how technological progress affects emissions strategies and mitigation costs. Their comparison of models incorporating data on the economy, energy use and the environment suggests that climate policies such as the Kyoto Protocol will trigger technological change. They estimate that the cost of stabilizing emissions at 450 parts per million \u2014 a value it is hoped will be sufficient to avoid dangerous climate change \u2014 would be just 0.4% of the world's present gross product (O. Edenhofer  et al .  Energy J. , in the press). And this week, William Nordhaus, an economist at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut, published results from a model that combines data on historical climate, economic activity and country-specific temperature predictions to estimate the economic impact of a temperature rise of 3 \u00b0C. He concludes that such a rise would cause a 1\u20133% decline in global income \u2014 significantly larger than previous estimates (W. D. Nordhaus  Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA  doi:10.1073/pnas.0509842103; 2006). The IPCC is starting to consider economists' concerns. In September 2005 it set up a group to look at scenario development led by Bert Metz, a chemist at the Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency and co-chair of Working Group III. Metz says he will recommend the development of completely new emissions scenarios, including a more sophisticated treatment of convergence and technology. The IPCC will decide on whether to go ahead with Metz's plan at a meeting in April on Mauritius. But even if work starts now, the scenarios won't be ready for use until the IPCC's fifth assessment report, due in 2013 or later. For critics such as Tol and Edenhofer, that's not a moment too soon. \u201cEconomists must learn to bring their knowledge to bear in the discussion, and climate scientists need to realize the significance of economics,\u201d says Edenhofer. Rather than arguing about temperature predictions, \u201cthe future battle will be about cost and damages\u201d.

San Diego As the US Navy plans to expand its testing of sonar in the oceans, the creation of an independent research programme to find out how the noise may affect marine mammals seems doomed. Evidence is also emerging that the Navy may have been pressuring scientists to downplay links between sonar and damage to marine life. After two years of meetings costing nearly $1 million, an advisory committee of scientific, military and industry leaders convened by the US Marine Mammal Commission (MMC) has collapsed. Instead of producing a consensus-based report on how best to study the effects of sonar on marine mammals, the 28 members will, next week, submit individual recommendations. The MMC will then report to US Congress in the next few months, but without agreement, it is unlikely that any research will be funded. At the beginning of the decade, environmental groups took the Navy to court over its use of low-frequency sonar. The Navy lost early court rounds, but after going to Congress, won exemptions from environmental laws. In 2003, Congress created the MMC advisory panel, in which warring parties were brought together to hammer out a plan for future research and management. It was hoped that agreed research questions would be pursued by an independent programme, estimated to cost about $25 million over five years. Such research is badly needed. Little is known about how marine mammals are affected by sonar \u2014 although whales or dolphins have repeatedly been found beached after military sonar tests. The strongest evidence for its destructive effects comes from British researchers, who reported that military sonar off the Canary Islands was linked to decompression deaths of beaked whales (P. D. Jepson  et al .  Nature   425 , 575\u2013576; 2003). A subsequent study found cavities in sperm whale skeletons, supporting the idea that whales suffer from decompression sickness (M. J. Moore and G. A. Early  Science   306,  2215; 2004). MMC executive director David Cottingham says the committee couldn't agree because of \u201cthe high degree of uncertainty over the impact of various noises on marine mammals\u201d. But interviews with observers and panel members suggest that the Navy, as well as other groups that use sonar, including geophysical researchers and the oil and gas industry, blocked a consensus. A Navy spokesman, however, denies this; along with representatives from the other groups, Navy officials insist that they are interested in good science. \n               What lies beneath \n             Mammalogists on the panel disagree. \u201cThis process has been a travesty of fiscal responsibility, scientific integrity, and environmental stewardship,\u201d Lindy Weilgart of Dalhousie University in Nova Scotia, Canada, wrote to the MMC as the committee disintegrated last September. \u201cThe science of ocean sound is highly politicized,\u201d adds Hal Whitehead, a marine mammalogist at Dalhousie and Weilgart's husband. \u201cI see the breakdown of the committee as an indication that the Navy and others didn't want Congress to have a clear picture of what the risks are.\u201d Either way, the promised research is unlikely to happen. And scientists question whether the current US programme, funded mainly by the Navy, will tackle questions fairly and openly. Late last year, a lawsuit forced the release of e-mails in which military officials discussed their attempts to pressurize a researcher funded by the Office of Naval Research (ONR) to withhold comments on the damaging effects of sonar. The 2001 e-mails detail how Robert Gisiner, who manages the ONR's mammal research funding programme, engaged in \u201ca pretty scorching phone call\u201d with Robert Schusterman, a marine biologist at the University of California at Santa Cruz. Schusterman had filed comments for an environmental report saying that a Navy sonar test could be harmful to marine mammals. Gisiner denies any impropriety and says he was simply \u201ctalking to an old friend\u201d. And last week, a report by Teri Rowles, co-ordinator of the National Marine Fisheries Service's (NMFS) stranding programme, was made public in another court case; the National Resources Defense Council is aiming to force the NMFS to release information about the potential impact of a new training range planned off North Carolina. In an initial version of the report, Rowles reported that the death of at least one whale stranded on the North Caro-lina coast last year could have been caused by sonar. But in the final report released by the NMFS, the link to sonar had been removed. Critics see such incidents as evidence of the conflict of interest inherent in the current Navy programme. Whitehead and Weilgart wrote in October that the funding system should be changed, \u201cto safeguard the credibility of the field and protect us all from conflicts of interest\u201d (see  Mar. Mamm. Sci.   21,  779\u2013781; 2005). Meanwhile, the public has until the end of January to comment on the Navy's plans for a new training range. \n                     Court ruling sounds note of caution for sonar system \n                   \n                     Gas-bubble lesions in stranded cetaceans \n                   \n                     Pathology: Whales, sonar and decompression sickness \n                   \n                     Pathology: Whales, sonar and decompression sickness (reply) \n                   \n                     Natural Resources Defense Council statement \n                   \n                     Science  paper \u2013 Seismology: Suit Ties Whale Deaths to Research Cruise \n                   \n                     Science  paper \u2013 Ecology: A Roaring Debate Over Ocean Noise \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

A fresh round of research missions is set to probe the seafloor rupture that triggered the devastating tsunami of 2004. But when researchers arrive in the Indian Ocean, they will find some areas are off-limits. As with previous studies of the region, vessels will not have permission from the Indian government to enter the country's territorial waters. It is a policy that hampers research, say scientists involved, and ultimately sets back attempts to prepare for earthquakes. The first of this year's missions set sail from Bremen in Germany on 20 January. Organized by the Federal Institute for Geosciences and Natural Resources in Hannover, the six-week mission will run studies such as seismic surveys and sediment sampling. The data gathered will boost efforts to model the earthquake and help gauge the likelihood of further major tsunamis in the area. Other nations, including Britain and the United States, also plan to send ships, but none will be able to survey the northernmost 900 km of the 1,300-km rupture zone. This part lies in Indian waters, and researchers say they have not even attempted to ask for permission to enter. Indian science secretary Valangiman Ramamurthi told  Nature  that the ministry of defence does not allow any foreign vessels in its territory for \u201creasons of national security and sovereignty\u201d. That stance is unusual. With other countries scientists say they are almost always able to reach an agreement to send research missions. But after decades of being refused entry to Indian waters, they are resigned to relying on the limited data produced by Indian research vessels and the occasional chance to join those voyages. David Tappin of the British Geological Survey in Nottingham, who is sailing with the German team, says access to the southern part of the 2004 rupture zone is crucial for studying the behaviour of the two plates that caused the earthquake. They interact differently in different places, he explains. In the north, the plates slip horizontally past each other. But in the south, the Indian plate is moving underneath its neighbour. Chris Goldfinger, a marine geologist at Oregon State University in Corvallis who is organizing a trip for later this year, says lack of access is hampering attempts to understand how frequently major earthquakes have occurred in the area. \u201cThis is readily determined by geologic sampling,\u201d says Goldfinger. Such sampling is currently only scheduled for Indonesia, he says, leaving important work to a scattering of good but limited efforts under way in India.

Its highly eccentric, 248-year orbit means that during 1979-99 it was closer to the Sun than Neptune. It will swing back out to its most distant point of 49.5 AU in about 2113. \n               1992 \n             The first evidence that Pluto is just one of a band of numerous Kuiper-bell objects (KBOs) arrives with the discovery of (15760) 1992 QB.

Astronomers say they have found the most Earth-like planet yet outside our Solar System. At just 5.5 times the mass of Earth it is one of the smallest extrasolar planets ever found, and orbits its star at a distance comparable to that of habitable worlds. Similarly sized extrasolar planets have been found before. But the method used to detect them meant we could see smallish planets only when they were very close to their suns, and such bodies are battered by scorching radiation.  Planet OGLE-2005-BLG-390Lb looks much more like home. It lies about 390 million kilometres from its star: if it were inside our Solar System, the planet would sit between Mars and Jupiter. It takes ten years for the planet to orbit its parent star, a common-or-garden red dwarf that lies about 28,000 light years from Earth, close to the centre of our Galaxy.  But sadly this Earth-like body probably isn't crawling with life. Its dwarf star is so dim that the surface temperature of this planet is thought to be about - 220 \u00b0C.  \"The search for a second Earth is the driving force behind our research,\" says Daniel Kubas at the European Southern Observatory in Santiago de Chile, Chile, part of the team that made the discovery. They are optimistic that the clever method they used to spot the planet could soon uncover an alien twin to our own world.  \n              Wobbly stars \n           More than 170 planets have been discovered outside our Solar System. Astronomers usually detect them by watching how they make their parent star wiggle, a technique known as the Doppler method. This is ideal if you are looking for massive planets orbiting very close to their star, which induce a lot of wobble.  But there is no way this can be used to find small, blue-green planets approximately 150 million kilometres from a yellow sun. It is simply not sensitive enough, says Didier Queloz, an astronomer from Geneva Observatory in Switzerland who was part of the team that found the first extrasolar planet, just 11 years ago 1 . The new sighting relies on an effect called gravitational lensing, where a massive object such as a star warps space so that it behaves like a lens. This means that it bends and slightly magnifies light from a more distant star before it reaches our telescopes. Adding a planet to the mix modifies the lensing effect by a tiny amount, just enough to work out its mass and orbit. \"Microlensing is the fastest way to find small, cool planets, down to the mass of the Earth,\" says Keith Horne, one of the planet's discoverers and an astronomer from the University of St Andrews, UK.  \n              Spot the difference \n            The planet was found by a consortium of 73 astronomers from 12 different countries. Its star was first spotted by scientists working on the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE), before the planet itself was noticed by astronomer Pascal Fouqu\u00e9.  OGLE-2005-BLG-390Lb is only the third planet found using the microlensing technique so far, but astronomers expect to spot many more. \"The other two microlensing planets have masses of a few times that of Jupiter, but the discovery of a five-Earth-mass planet is a strong hint that these objects are very common,\" says Jean-Philippe Beaulieu of the Astrophysics Institute of Paris.

Two patent applications filed by the California Institute of Technology will proceed despite concerns over the accuracy of data they contain,  Nature  has learned. The patents were filed on behalf of the institute's president, David Baltimore, and Luk Van Parijs, formerly a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Van Parijs was considered a rising star in the field of immunology, but was sacked last year for fabricating data in at least one published paper. Several of his papers use duplicate images, but none of his co-authors has been implicated in any misconduct. Unlike scientific papers, patent applications do not depend on data but on claims to have conceived a new invention. Inventors often include data, however, to demonstrate the novelty or usefulness of their claims, or to increase the enforceability of the patent once granted. In the United States, in contrast to many other countries, inventors must sign a declaration affirming that everything in their application is true to the best of their knowledge. The inclusion of false data, even by mistake, could be an infringement of the oath, and thus against the law. Or it could form the basis for questioning the patent later, says Alan Grimaldi, co-chair of the intellectual-property group at Howrey law firm in Washington DC. The applications were based on work carried out during Van Parijs's postdoc time in Baltimore's lab; the only other person on them is Lili Yang, a research scientist in the lab. They describe a novel method of gene therapy in which bone-marrow stem cells are infected with a virus to introduce extra genes, then transplanted into a patient where they produce modified immune cells. Depending on the genes inserted, the technique could treat HIV or cancer, the inventors claim. The research upon which this is based has not been questioned. But the patent applications contain at least two instances in which identical images are labelled as coming from different cell populations; three others may also be wrongly identified. When questioned by  Nature , Baltimore admitted one of the errors and said he would correct it; he is considering the others. He insists, however, that Van Parijs is not responsible. \u201cThe patents are fine, and we're proceeding with them,\u201d he says. \u201cSomebody sent in the wrong file. It probably happened in the patent office after we sent them the data.\u201d The status of false data in patents has already come under scrutiny this month. An application on human embryonic stem cells filed by South Korean cloner Woo Suk Hwang of Seoul National University includes data on a cell line discredited by an investigation into his work. His university has said the application will proceed after amendments have been made. If granted, however, some fear it could block patents by other researchers, or that Hwang might profit financially from others' work. The Van Parijs applications may also raise concerns if not corrected. The gene therapy described is a promising area of research, and other work suggests the principle may well be valid. For example, Derek Sant'Angelo at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York has made modified immune cells using a similar approach. In general, the existence of invalid data in patents \u2014 intentional or not \u2014 would be \u201ca concern\u201d to other inventors, says Sant'Angelo. \n                     Ethics and fraud \n                   \n                     Scientific blues \n                   \n                     News In Brief \n                   \n                     Universities scramble to assess scope of falsified results \n                   \n                     Penalties plus high-quality review to fight plagiarism \n                   \n                     Hwang special \n                   \n                     California Institute of Technology \n                   \n                     David Baltimore \n                   \n                     The Baltimore Laboratory \n                   \n                     Massachusetts Institute of Technology \n                   \n                     US Patent and Trademark Office \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Physicists in the United States have discovered a way to make what is essentially laser light, without using a laser. All you need to do, they say, is give a crystal of table salt a sharp knock. It was previously assumed that this would do nothing more than squeeze sparks and ordinary light out of the crystal. But Evan Reed of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California and his co-workers say that the shock will also generate a small amount of 'coherent' light 1 , the stuff that comes from lasers.  This unexpected source of laser-like light is not just an academic oddity. The new work shows that the coherent light coming from shocked salt should be in a fequency band called terahertz radiation, which cannot be generated by ordinary lasers, says Marin Soljacic, one of Reed's collaborators. Terahertz radiation, with wavelengths of about a millimetre to tens of micrometres, is increasingly in demand for biomedical and technological applications. In particular, the radiation can peer through human flesh to image the anatomy beneath, without harming tissues the way X-rays do. You might not get much of this kind of light out of a grain of salt, the team notes. But it could also provide a useful diagnostic tool for studying the effects of shock waves on crystalline materials, says Soljacic, who is based at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).  \n              The light fantastic \n           Light is composed of packets of energy called photons, each of which can be described as a wave with a particular frequency and wavelength. In ordinary (incoherent) light, like that from a light bulb, these waves rise and fall independently of one another. In coherent light, on the other hand, the waves are all synchronized, rather like a group of soldiers marching in step. It is this characteristic that gives laser light its special properties. The beam stays bright and does not spread out, for example, enabling the fine focus necessary in CD and DVD players. Making coherent light in lasers is a feat of coordination: all the photons are released together thanks to a positive feedback process through which one photon stimulates the release of another. This process gives 'laser' its name: it's an acronym of Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation. Reed and colleagues say that the coherence of light emitted from a shocked crystal comes instead from the way that a shock wave passing through the material can induce the regular rows of atoms to move in synchrony. This motion produces an electromagnetic wave - in other words, light.  \n              Look and you shall find \n            Countless experiments have investigated the effects of shock waves on materials; the Lawrence Livermore lab is one of the world leaders in this area. But Reed's team says that coherent light emission has never been seen before, simply because no one thought to look for it.  His team tested their idea in a computer model, which predicted how sodium chloride (common salt) should behave when exposed to the kind of shock wave produced by an explosion or a bright laser pulse. The result was spikes of radiation emitted at extreme-infrared (terahertz) frequencies, corresponding to bands of coherent emission. So much for the theory; will it work in practice? Reed says he is hoping to find out, in an experimental collaboration between the Livermore lab and Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico. \"The big difficulty is detecting the coherent signal.

The first ever sample of a comet parachuted safely down to the Utah desert early on Sunday 15 January. The Stardust mission's capsule left a bright streak of light in the night sky as it tore through the atmosphere at more than 46,000 kilometres per hour, before popping a series of parachutes and driving into the desert sand at 2:10 local time. The milligram or so of dust inside is the first geological sample returned from space since the Apollo flights of the early 1970s, says Phil Bland, a planetary scientist from Imperial College London, UK, who will be one of the first to get his hands on the grains. \"It's so exciting,\" he says. \"I was three years old when the last Apollo samples came back, and there have been no rocks brought back from space since then.\" Stardust's 4.6-billion-kilometre round trip to the comet Wild 2 took a total of seven years. Its close encounter in January 2004 gave us our best picture of a comet yet, with a surface pockmarked by craters and a surprisingly rigid core.  \n              Clean sweep \n            Skimming just 240 kilometres from the comet's surface, the craft detected simple organic molecules in the particles drifting from Wild 2. To get a closer look, it swept a soft, lightweight material called aerogel through the halo of dust and gas surrounding the comet's tail, and bagged a sample. The few thousand specks of dust collected are thought to date back 4.6 billion years, to a time when the Solar System was first forming. Scientists hope that the samples will give them clues about the chemical make-up of the primordial rubble that spawned the planets. Identifying minerals in the grains should reveal which elements were available as building blocks for our Solar System, and what sorts of stars created them. And if researchers find minerals that have been altered by water in the past, it might help to determine whether comets were instrumental in delivering much of the water in Earth's oceans, says Bland.  \n              Dividing the spoils \n            Stardust's racquet-sized collector will be shipped to NASA's Johnson Space Centre in Houston, Texas. There it will be divided into minute crumbs and sent to about 180 researchers around the world for analysis. \"We've never had a comet in the lab before,\" says Bland, adding that the firsts tests should reveal whether rocks that have previously been identified as meteorites could in fact have come from disintegrating comets. \"To see the capsule safely back on its home planet is a thrilling accomplishment,\" says Don Brownlee of the University of Washington, Seattle, who leads the Stardust science team.   The engineers who built Stardust, from aerospace giant Lockheed Martin of Bethesda, Maryland, also heaved a sigh of relief. In September 2004, their Genesis spacecraft smashed into the Utah desert after switches designed to detect its re-entry into the Earth's atmosphere failed to deploy its parachutes. Investigations revealed that the switches had been installed upside down. Having delivered its sample capsule, the Stardust mother ship has been put into orbit around the Sun. Although no extended mission is planned, NASA officials say they are open to any suggestions that could send the craft on another adventure, such as exploring asteroids. \n                   More Physical Science stories \n                 \n                   Stardust Mission \n                 \n                   Comet Wild 2 \n                 Reprints and Permissions"},

Sydney Some of the world's biggest polluters and energy consumers met last week under a scheme trumpeted by organizers as a \u201ccomplement\u201d to the Kyoto Protocol. Members of the Asia\u2013Pacific Partnership (AP6) on Clean Development and Climate promised to provide practical solutions to climate change, by driving industrial partnerships and encouraging new, cleaner technologies. But with voluntary participation, no emissions targets, no deadlines and little new money, environmental groups are somewhat sceptical. Can industry really be counted on to clean up its act? The inaugural meeting of the AP6, held in Sydney on 11 and 12 January, was attended by senior government and business representatives from Australia, China, India, Japan, South Korea and the United States \u2014 countries that together are responsible for around half of the world's greenhouse-gas emissions. But environmental groups are not impressed by AP6's unwillingness to set targets or adopt carbon trading. \u201cIt's incredibly disappointing that AP6 isn't prepared to put in place financial mechanisms to reward those who invest in cleaner energy and penalize those who don't,\u201d says Erwin Jackson of the Australian Conservation Foundation, based in Melbourne. Many industry representatives see it differently. \u201cI don't think the first step should be to create an unequal playing field by putting carbon-trading mechanisms in one place and not in another,\u201d counters Oscar Groeneveld, chief executive of the Rio Tinto Aluminium group. So the meeting focused instead on garnering a range of softer commitments from industry \u2014 to share knowledge, develop technology and improve operating practices. The main achievement was the establishment of eight government\u2013industry task forces to focus on power generation; coal mining; building and appliances; the production of cleaner fossil energy, renewable energy, steel, aluminium and cement. The groups will meet separately to formulate priorities, action plans and progress indicators, before reporting back to the next AP6 gathering, probably in January next year. Supporters insist this will bring significant gains. \u201cThere are some low-hanging fruit,\u201d says Groeneveld. \u201cIf we lift the performance of the \u2018bottom half of class\u2019, we can improve the whole industry and substantially reduce emissions.\u201d Both the Australian and US governments committed new funds: AU$100 million (US$75.5 million) over five years, and a one-off US$52 million respectively. But industry is largely expected to foot the bill. Details of exactly what will change are lacking, however, as industry groups say they will essentially continue their ongoing investment into research and development. Advocates of AP6, including US Secretary of Energy Samuel Bodman, point to the aluminium industry as evidence that the voluntary approach can work. The industry set a series of \u201cvoluntary objectives\u201d in 2003, such as reducing perfluorocarbon (PFC) emissions, which Groeneveld claims have been \u201ccollectively reduced by 75% since 1990\u201d. That doesn't impress the critics. \u201cThere is not much new money on the table and we already have a large number of technology-transfer mechanisms in place,\u201d says Iain McGill, an engineer who is researching energy markets at the University of New South Wales in Sydney. \u201cYou have to question how significant the initiative is,\u201d says McGill.

The fallout from the scandal surrounding Korean stem-cell research has sparked a call for journals to toughen up their financial disclosure policies.  The call follows  Science 's retraction of two papers based on work from the lab of Woo Suk Hwang, of Seoul National University in South Korea.  Science 's formal retraction was issued on 12 January, two days after the university's investigative panel found that both papers were fabricated (see ' Verdict: Hwang's human stem cells were all fakes ').  Before the papers were published, both Hwang and his former colleague, Gerald Schatten of the University of Pittsburgh in Pennsylvania, applied for patents based on their cloning and stem-cell technologies (see ' Schatten in the spotlight ').  Should the patents be granted, the scientists could make a fortune from the techniques. But no disclosure of these potential conflicts of financial interest appeared in either of the  Science  papers 1 , 2 , nor in a 2005  Nature  paper about a cloned dog 3  that also bears both men's names.  \n              Stepping in \n            Editors of the journals say they are investigating whether the authors complied with conflict-of-interest rules. But an independent critic says both publications should revise their policies and give them more clout, to prevent such omissions in future.  On 12 January, Merrill Goozner of the Washington-based Center for Science in the Public Interest sent letters to  Science  and  Nature  asking them to \"tighten\" their policies. He called  Science 's policy \"weak and ineffectual\" and said the journal should publish all conflicts of interest \"that might bear a relationship to the subject matter of the contribution\".  Goozner also advised  Science  and  Nature  to impose a three-year ban on authors who violate their policies, as the US journal Environmental Health Perspectives does.  \n              The rules \n             Science  requires authors submitting papers to the journal to check a box if they have \"a planned, pending, or awarded patent on this work by you or your institution\". There is then a space for authors to provide details. Natasha Pinol, a spokeswoman for  Science 's publisher, the American Association for the Advancement of Science, says this box was not checked for Hwang's 2004 paper. But Hwang or someone on his team did check it for their 2005 paper. No details were provided about the potential conflict of interest, however, and no disclosure appeared in the published paper. When asked why  Science  decided not to print any disclosure information, editor Donald Kennedy replied: \"Normally we check the relationship between the topic of the patent and the substance of the paper. In this case the box was checked, but no description was given.\" The journal would not clarify whether it pressed the authors for further details or not.  Nature  has a very similar policy, asking authors to declare whether they have \"patents or patent applications whose value may be affected by publication\"; disclosures are published with the paper. For the 2005 paper about a cloned dog, Hwang ticked a box for \"no competing interests\" on behalf of all the authors.  Philip Campbell,  Nature 's editor-in-chief, says that the apparent breach of the journal's policy is being taken up with authors. If it is confirmed, the journal will publish a correction.  \n              Missing disclosures \n            Critics say the Hwang debacle has exposed general shortcomings in the journals' conflict-of-interest policies. In July 2004, the Center for Science in the Public Interest released a report on papers in four journals over three months. The report found that authors had failed to disclose conflicts of interest in 8% of the articles; a finding that spurred several journals, including  Environmental Health Perspectives , to alter their policies.  \"It occurs disturbingly often,\" Goozner says. \"Now you are seeing people not disclosing in some very high-profile cases, and this is possible because the policies of  Science  and  Nature  do not have teeth.\"  Pinol says that Science is looking at its financial conflict-of-interest policy as part of an overall review after the retractions. In an e-mail, Kennedy says, \"We are certainly looking at the problem, with an expectation that we can institute some changes.\"  The Hwang affair has led Nature to revisit its policies on the data needed to support cloning papers (see ' Standards for papers on cloning '), and it is also reviewing procedures that concern image manipulation. Campbell adds that the journal is considering Goozner's points about conflicts of interest. \n                   Woo Suk Hwang Special \n                 \n                   Stem Cells in Focus \n                 \n                   Science COI policy \n                 \n                   Nature COI Policy \n                 \n                   Environmental Health Perspectives COI policy \n                 \n                   Center for Science in the Public Interest \n                 Reprints and Permissions"},

Some of the 'friendly bacteria' found in yoghurt have been genetically modified to release a drug that blocks HIV infection. Although the bacteria have only been tested in a lab dish, scientists are optimistic that the technique could provide a cheaper and more effective way of delivering drugs to fight the spread of AIDS, by getting the bugs to live right where the drugs are needed most.  The bacterium ( Lactococcus lactis ) the researchers have modified naturally produces lactic acid, and so is used to produce cheese and yoghurt. It is also found in some parts of the human anatomy, including the gut and the vagina, where the acid it produces damps down the growth of other, harmful bacteria. Some 'probiotic' yoghurts are loaded with such beasties with the aim of keeping consumers' guts healthy (see ' Gut Reaction '). Bharat Ramratnam, an HIV specialist at Brown Medical School, Providence, Rhode Island, and his colleagues have now altered the genetic make-up of  L. lactis  so that it generates cyanovirin, a drug that has prevented HIV infection in monkeys and human cells, and is on track for human trials in 2007.  Cyanovirin binds to sugar molecules attached to the HIV virus, blocking a receptor that HIV uses to infect cells. \"It's basically passive immunization,\" says Sean Hanniffy, a molecular biologist at the Institute of Food Research, Norwich, UK, and part of the team. Gels containing cyanovirin could afford some protection for women against the transmission of HIV, but since the drug breaks down quickly these would have to be smeared in the vagina immediately before sex. \"In some countries there's a reluctance to use these gels frequently,\" explains Hanniffy.  Because lactic-acid bacteria live naturally in the vagina, one application of a bacterial goop should see the modified bugs thrive there for at least a week, says Hanniffy. \"The next step might be to use other bacteria that can survive for even longer,\" he adds.  \n              Cheap and easy \n            Hanniffy says that the bugs may offer advantages over injected vaccines, which often have trouble reaching peripheral areas of the body, such as mucosal surfaces in the vagina. \"You need less of the therapeutic chemical if you deliver it locally,\" adds Lothar Steidler, a molecular biologist at Cork University in Ireland who has also worked on modifying bacteria to deliver drugs. \"There's also an economic issue,\" says Hanniffy. Simply brewing a vat of the bacteria should be much simpler and cheaper than producing a drug gel, he says. And if the bugs could be taken orally, as in probiotic yoghurts, production should be even easier. \"You could produce the drug wherever you have the facilities to make a dairy product,\" says Steidler. \"It makes lifelong treatment more feasible from an economic point of view.\" \"The biggest problem at the moment is treating people in developing countries,\" says Steidler. \"This new therapeutic approach could be a profound answer to those needs.\"  \n              Fear of bugs \n            Public fear of genetic modification may stop this research going forward, warns Hanniffy. \"It's definitely a barrier right now,\" he says. \"But if there was a success story I think we'd see a rise in acceptance.\" One such success might come from the first clinical trial of a transgenic bacteria, which was completed last year in the Netherlands and used altered  L. lactis  to deliver a drug to 10 patients with Crohn's disease, a chronic bowel disorder (see ' Better living through microbes ').  This was the first time permission was given to use live genetically modified bacteria in a clinical situation, Hanniffy says. \"It's a small trial, but a big step.\"  The bugs were carefully engineered to ensure that they could not survive outside the body, and that there was no gene transfer to their host 1 , 2 . The same technique could also be used to deliver a wide variety of drugs, says Steidler. \"This technique could be a completely new kind of pharmacology,\" he says.

Scientists studying virus samples from the human outbreak of avian flu in Turkey have identified three mutations in the virus's sequence. They say that at least two of these look likely to make the virus better adapted to humans. The Turkey outbreak is unusual, because of the large family clusters of cases; the fact that many of those infected have only mild symptoms; and the speed with which infections have arisen \u2014 twenty cases, including four deaths, in less than two weeks. So scientists are urgently trying to establish whether the virus is behaving differently in this outbreak from previous ones in Asia. In particular, international teams are investigating the possibility that the virus is moving between people. \u201cWith such a large number of cases within such a short period of time, human-to-human transmission is something that we've had to consider,\u201d says Maria Cheng, a spokeswoman at World Health Organization (WHO) headquarters in Geneva. As  Nature  went to press, samples from the first two teenagers in the country to die had been sequenced by a WHO collaborating centre at the National Institute of Medical Research (NIMR) in London. The results so far are not comforting. The first mutation found, announced last week, involves a substitution in one sample of an amino acid at position 223 of the haemoagglutinin receptor protein. This protein allows the flu virus to bind to the receptors on the surface of its host's cells. This mutation has been observed twice before \u2014 in a father and son in Hong Kong in 2003, and in one fatal case in Vietnam last year. It increases the virus's ability to bind to human receptors, and decreases its affinity for poultry receptors, making strains with this mutation better adapted to infecting humans. The same sample also contained a mutation at position 153 of the haemoagglutinin protein,  Nature  has learned. Cheng says this information was not included in WHO statements, because \u201cit is not clear what role this particular change plays\u201d. Finally, both samples from the Turkish teenagers show a substitution of glutamic acid with lycine, at position 627 of the polymerase protein, which the virus uses to replicate its genetic material. This mutation has been seen in other flu sequences from Eurasian poultry over the past year. It was also present in the one person who died during an outbreak of H7N7 in the Netherlands in 2003, and in a few people in Vietnam and Thailand. The polymerase mutation is one of the ten genetic changes that gave rise to the 1918 pandemic flu virus. Like the 223-haemoagglutinin mutation, it signals adaptation to humans, says Alan Hay, director of a WHO influenza laboratory at the NIMR. \u201cThere is this glutamic acid\u2013lysine flip,\u201d he explains. \u201cGlutamic acid is associated with flu-virus replication in birds, and lycine is in primates.\u201d The Turkey strains are the first in which the polymerase and receptor-binding mutations have been found together. They could make it easier for humans to catch the virus from poultry. But they might also favour human-to-human transmission. This is because the polymerase change helps the virus to survive in the cooler nasal regions of the respiratory tract, and the haemoagglutinin mutation encourages the virus to target receptors in the nose and throat, rather than lower down in the lungs. The virus is thought to be more likely to spread through droplets coughed from the nose and throat than from infections lower down. Hay points out, however, that it is difficult to predict how the mutations will actually influence the virus's behaviour. He adds that just two changes are unlikely to create efficient human-to-human transmission on their own. Establishing what effects these changes are having on the epidemiology of the current outbreak is a top priority for research teams working in Turkey. \u201cWe must learn more about the mild cases and be absolutely sure of whether these viruses are behaving differently from those we have seen elsewhere,\u201d says Hay. \u201cIt is early days in terms of what we know about the viruses causing these infections.\u201d Researchers are sequencing more strains from the Turkey cases, to see whether they share the mutations and to check for further changes. Samples were expected to arrive in London on 18 January, after being held up for more than a week in Turkey because of the Eid ul-Adha holiday period. \n                     Bird flu mutation sparks concern \n                   \n                     Yes, but will it jump? \n                   \n                     Nature gets mashed up \n                   \n                     Bird flu takes lives in Turkey \n                   \n                     The 1918 flu virus is resurrected \n                   \n                     Avian flu special: Avian flu: Are we ready? \n                   \n                     Nature's Avian Flu mashup (requires Google Earth) \n                   \n                     Avian Flu web focus \n                   \n                     Bird Flu in focus \n                   \n                     Google Earth (required for mashup) \n                   \n                     World Health Organization: Avian Influenza \n                   \n                     Connotea web resources \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Results are starting to come in from what may be the largest-ever study of the practice of peer review. Three prestigious medical journals \u2014  The Lancet, Annals of Internal Medicine  and the  BMJ  \u2014 threw open their doors and allowed the study team unprecedented access. Researchers were able to see all relevant paperwork, including confidential referee reports, and were permitted to video editorial meetings. The result is a data set that documents the passage of more than 1,000 papers through the peer-review process, from submission to publication or, far more often, rejection (see  \u2018The data set\u2019 ). Having cameras in meetings was a bizarre experience, says Richard Horton, editor of  The Lancet  \u2014 he says it felt like the researchers were making a reality television show about medical journals. But Horton adds the process was well worth it, as \u201cthis is a huge study, which makes the results very reliable\u201d. Those results, the first of which were submitted for publication earlier this month, give a qualified thumbs up to current editorial practices. They may also go some way to dispelling widely held doubts about peer review. One question investigated by the study authors, who are based at the University of California, San Francisco, is whether editors favour positive results over null findings. Many researchers do not attempt to publish negative results, assuming that editors are not interested. This is a particular problem in medicine, because the efficacy of a drug will be exaggerated if trials reporting negative results are not published. But when the California researchers compared the 68 manuscripts that were published with those rejected, they found no evidence of bias towards statistically significant results. \u201cHopefully, this will encourage authors to submit,\u201d says Kirby Lee, an expert in evidence-based health care and an author on the study. \u201cPublication bias is a serious problem; it can really skew results in meta-analyses.\u201d Other findings also tend towards the quantitative (see  \u2018Dissecting peer review\u2019 ). But peer-review experts say the qualitative parts of the study, which had to wait for transcripts of the videos, are likely to prove more interesting. \u201cPeer review can be a complex decision-making process involving lots of people,\u201d notes Sara Schroter, who studies journal practice at the BMJ Publishing Group in London. \u201cIf you want to understand why something happens it is best to conduct qualitative research.\u201d Lee says that the qualitative study should shed light on issues such as the criteria that editors use when deciding to review or reject articles, as well as how interactions at editorial meetings help shape decisions about publication. \u201cWe want to identify sources of systematic bias in the editorial review process that may result in a publication record that is not representative of the true distribution of study findings submitted to each journal,\u201d he says. Horton adds that the study could also help improve public understanding of peer review. The timing is good, he says, because questions about editorial standards are being asked in the wake of the scandal surrounding the South Korean stem-cell scientist Woo Suk Hwang, who published two widely acclaimed papers later found to have been faked. Horton says that some criticisms, such as failure to spot fabricated data, stem from a lack of understanding about what peer review can and cannot do. \u201cPeer review is a black box to the public and politicians,\u201d he says. \u201cUnless we open up that box we are going to get misperceptions.\u201d \n                     Verdict: Hwang's human stem cells were all fakes \n                   \n                     Industry money skews drug overviews \n                   \n                     Scientific publishing: Peer review, unmasked \n                   \n                     BMJ \n                   \n                     The Lancet \n                   \n                     Annals of Internal Medicine \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

A Norwegian researcher dreamed up the lives and lifestyles of some 900 people \u2014 and used them in a study on cancer. Then, last October, Jon Sudb\u00f8 had his results published in  The Lancet . The revelation comes hard on the heels of the Woo Suk Hwang scandal, in which several important advances in human cloning reported by the South Korean researcher turned out to be faked. The blatant nature of Sudb\u00f8's fiction emphasizes questions already being asked about the effectiveness of peer review, even in top journals, and about who should be responsible for catching fraud (see  page 243 ). The latest deception was discovered by Camilla Stoltenberg, a director of epidemiology at the Norwegian Institute of Public Health in Oslo, who was catching up on her literature reading over Christmas. Sudb\u00f8's paper claims to analyse a public-health database and show that taking anti-inflammatory drugs can reduce the incidence of mouth cancer (J. Sudb\u00f8  et al .  Lancet   366,  1359\u20131366; 2005). \u201cI was surprised because it refers to the Cohort of Norway, for which I am responsible,\u201d Stoltenberg says. She knew that this could not have been the source of the lifestyle data as the paper claimed. Last week, Sudb\u00f8, who is based at the Norwegian Radium Hospital in Oslo, admitted that the data had not come from that database or any other, but from thin air. Many details of this case still need to be worked out. There is some indication that Sudb\u00f8 may have mental health problems. It is also not clear what his 13 co-authors knew about the fraud \u2014 the paper identifies three others as contributing equally to the research, and among the other co-authors are Sudb\u00f8's wife and his identical twin. None of the authors could be reached for comment. The hospital has asked that Sudb\u00f8's other work be examined in an independent investigation, to be set up this week by Anders Ekbom, an epidemiologist at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, Sweden. But the case is already set to change research policy in Norway. The country's health minister, Sylvia Brustad, announced on 16 January that previously stalled reforms on medical research will probably be law by the autumn. The new rules would put more responsibility for catching fraud on the shoulders of the institutions where the research was done.

Washington DC There's no point in complaining: some US ground-based telescopes almost certainly must close if the country's astronomy spending is to be brought under control. That was the bleak message delivered to a room of anxious astronomers on 10 January by officials of the National Science Foundation (NSF) during the American Astronomical Society's annual meeting in Washington DC. Faced with flat budgets and growing expenditures, the foundation has asked a panel of 13 senior scientists to find $30 million in savings out of the astronomy division's $195-million annual budget \u2014 by any means necessary. \u201cThe problem is huge,\u201d Wayne Van Citters, director of the foundation's astronomy division, told the assembled scientists. \u201cWe're rapidly outstripping our ability to operate the things that we are building.\u201d The agency is the main government supporter of ground-based astronomy in the United States. It operates several major facilities, including the Gemini, Kitt Peak, Arecibo and National Solar observatories, and the National Astronomy and Ionosphere Center. In addition to these telescopes, the NSF is planning several costly, next-generation projects. It is putting nearly $50 million a year towards constructing the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA), an international radio telescope set to be completed in 2012. And it recently committed $14 million to developing the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope, a project to digitally record much of the night sky. Money is allocated separately for the construction of these and other facilities, but Van Citters says it is unclear how the agency will operate them once they are built. In the fiscal year 2006, the foundation's entire maths and physical sciences budget grew by only $16 million, about half of the amount it will need annually just to operate ALMA. By slicing $30 million from existing facilities, the NSF hopes to make up for some of the expected shortfalls. Roger Blandford, director of the Kavli Institute for Particle Astrophysics and Cosmology in Stanford, California, chairs the panel that will recommend where the cuts should fall. The Washingon meeting was the last of seven held in an attempt to placate astronomers around the country since the panel was announced in August (see  Nature   436 , 616; 2005). Blandford says the panel will consider the scientific value of the various facilities, as well as their training capabilities, decommissioning costs and overlap with other observatories. Scientific value, in particular, is notoriously difficult to measure quantitatively \u2014 an attempt by one astronomer at the conference demonstrates as much (see  \u2018Which sites get cited?\u2019 ). \u201cThere are no easy targets,\u201d says Blandford. \u201cWe are trying very hard to make this a responsible process.\u201d It was clear that many of the 200 or so astronomers in the room were not convinced. \u201cIf we go through with the cuts then major facilities will disappear,\u201d warns Jeffrey Linsky, an astronomer at the Joint Institute for Laboratory Astrophysics in Boulder, Colorado. \u201cI say we complain, and complain bitterly.\u201d Van Citters told the crowd that this is not an option. \u201cWe have to go through this,\u201d he said. Blandford agrees: \u201cIt is economically necessary, but it is also politically necessary.\u201d Without proving that astronomers are serious about reining in spending, they are unlikely to win fresh funding from the White House. Blandford says the committee has received many letters and e-mails since the review was announced, most defending the merit of individual facilities. He and his panel members will now deliberate, aiming to produce recommendations by the end of March. At least astronomers have no cause to take the measures personally. In an era of flat budgets, such panels are likely to become commonplace, predicts Van Citters. \u201cI suspect within a year or two we're going to see more of this throughout the foundation.\u201d \n                     News in brief \n                   \n                     Funding battle heats up over large array \n                   \n                     Division of Astronomical Sciences Senior Review homepage \n                   \n                     American Astronomical Society meeting \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

New York Did you wake up this morning feeling blue? If you're a medical researcher, the answer may well be yes. A survey of faculty members in US medical schools has revealed that as many as one in five report signs of depression. Grumbles about spiralling stress are rife among researchers, but there have been few studies to gauge its effects in any field. So psychiatrist Barbara Schindler at Drexel University College of Medicine in Philadelphia and her team sent questionnaires to more than 3,500 faculty members in four US medical schools. The questions were part of established scales for measuring mental and physical health, as well as life and job satisfaction. The team received responses from more than half of the academics, and published its results this month (B. A. Schindler  et al .  Acad. Med.   81,  27\u201334; 2006). The most striking finding is that some 20% of researchers, both male and female, show symptoms consistent with clinical depression. This is roughly double the rate of such symptoms seen in the general population, and is a jump from the 14% found in a similar study in 1984. Younger researchers show more depressive symptoms than older ones, and basic researchers feel less strain than those who also see patients. Although the survey is small, the authors say it exposes the toll that work is taking on academics' mental health. \u201cWhen 20% of doctors are depressed you know something is wrong,\u201d Schindler says. Researchers report various reasons for growing strain at work. Faculty members at US medical schools say they are under increasing pressure to see fee-paying patients. This leaves them less time to pursue the research and publications that win promotion. \u201cI think these things mean there is less happiness and relaxation in medical schools,\u201d says George Mandel of George Washington University Medical Center in Washington DC. The repercussions are harder to predict. The Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) in Washington DC reports no fall in the number of faculty members it can recruit, or in the numbers dropping out. But increasing stress could be dissuading faculty members from carrying out research, says Kenneth Getz, whose work at the Tufts Center for the Study of Drug Development in Boston suggests that the number of principal investigators leading clinical trials has declined in the past few years. Diane Magrane, who is responsible for faculty development at the AAMC, says that many medical schools are already aware of poor staff morale and are introducing mentoring and support programmes to combat it. \u201cWhen you measure it, it allows you to do something,\u201d she says. \n                     Antidepressant fears highlight need for greater knowledge of depression and suicide \n                   \n                     Study to probe genetics of depression \n                   \n                     Association of American Medical Colleges \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

The rate of global sea-level rise has sped up during the twentieth century, Australian researchers have confirmed. This disturbing acceleration is predicted by climate models, but has been difficult to spot in real data; natural variations in sea level have masked long-term trends.  Now researchers have managed to tease out the acceleration from tide-gauge data, by cleaning up the information using satellite measurements.  Both these databases come with their own problems for spotting such trends: the first is too noisy; the second doesn't go far enough back in time. But by melding them together, John Church and Neil White of the Australian governmental science organization CSIRO's Marine and Atmospheric Research centre in Hobart, Tasmania, have managed to chart the sea's rise. They say the acceleration they have detected since 1870 matches up nicely with model predictions: if the acceleration continues as expected, by 2100 the seas will lap the shore about 31 centimetres higher, on average, than they did in 1990. That matches what has been forecast by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).  This will push back typical beach shorelines by around 300 metres. \"That's a real concern,\" says marine geologist Kenneth Miller of Rutgers University in New Jersey.  \n              Data clean-up \n            Sea levels are closely monitored by tide gauges all around the world. But pinning down average sea-level change is hard, because there are natural fluctuations in sea level that vary from place to place.  The issue is also complicated by subsidence or elevation of land masses. \"Teasing out sea level at any scale is a daunting challenge,\" says Miller. Most studies using tide-gauge data have failed to spot any acceleration, leading to suggestions that the models needed to be re-evaluated. Recent satellite measurements of sea level, which are more accurate and less variable than tide gauges, have suggested a relatively high rate of rise over the past decade 1 . But comparing this rate of sea-level rise to rates determined by tide gauges in the earlier part of the century is problematic: researchers weren't sure that the difference in rates wasn't down to the difference in measurement methods. Church and White decided to use both datasets to get the best result. They used satellite measurements to distinguish random 'noise' in recent tidal data from more systematic site-to-site variations. They could then use these results to clean up older tidal data.  \n              Rising tide \n            This gave them a smoother and more reliable record of sea-level change stretching back to 1870. They find that since then, not only has the sea level risen by an average of 1.7 millimetres each year, but the rate of rise has increased by an average of 0.01 millimetres per year. They report their results in  Geophysical Research Letters  this month 2 . The acceleration has not been steady, however. Sea-level rise was relatively high from 1930 to 1960, they say, and rates have wobbled up and down since then. The highest rate has been since the early 1990s, with sea levels shooting up by about 3 millimetres per year. Having a complete year-by-year record of the rates of rise will allow detailed comparison with climate models, Miller says. It will also enable researchers to study the effects of specific climate perturbations, such as volcanic eruptions.

Bacteria that live in soil have been found to harbour an astonishing armoury of natural weapons to fight off antibiotics. The discovery could help researchers anticipate the next wave of drug-resistant 'superbugs'. Researchers have long known that soil-dwelling bacteria make natural antibiotics, and that they have inbuilt ways to survive their own and other bugs' toxins; in some cases, the genes that help them dodge antibiotics have transferred into infectious bugs that plague humans.  Microbiologists have identified a few of the ways that soil microbes neutralize antibiotics. But Gerard Wright and his team at McMaster University in Ontario, Canada, have shown that soil microbes carry a hidden trove of such arms.  The team collected handfuls of dirt from towns and forests across Canada, and grew the bacteria contained within them. They isolated 480 different strains of the common soil bacteria  Streptomyces , which are known to synthesize a large number of antibiotics, and so are expected to have natural defenses against them. They then threw 21 different antibiotics (some natural, some synthetic), at the bugs to see if they could survive.  \n              Hard to beat \n            The strains were impervious to seven or eight antibiotics on average, the researchers report in  Science 1 , and two hardy ones were resistant to 15 drugs.  Many of the bacterial strains were immune to antibiotics that they have probably never been exposed to before. And the crafty creatures used some previously unknown ways to detoxify some drugs, such as adding a sugar molecule on to the drug telithromycin, which prevents it from crippling a cell.  Being able to disable so many antibiotics so easily may help the underground bacteria survive the cocktail of chemicals released by other microbes, fungi and plants in the underground, Wright suggests.  \n              Out of the dirt \n            The discovery raises fears that the genes underlying this glut of drug-resistance could jump into bacteria such as  Staphylococcus aureus , which causes hospital infections and is already resistant to almost everything on the pharmacy shelf.  \"The chances that these genes will end up in a disease-causing organism at some future point is high,\" says microbiologist Abigail Salyers, who studies microbe gene transfer at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Antibiotic resistance genes have escaped from the dirt before. Researchers think that the genes that allowed superbugs to resist vancomycin, one of the last lines of antibiotic defence prescribed by doctors, originally came from soil-dwelling bugs.  \n              Forewarned is forearmed \n            On the flip side, the findings could help doctors arm themselves against future superbugs. Drug companies seeking new antibiotics, for example, could test a prototype product on an array of soil bacteria to find organisms that are naturally resistant, and figure out how they manage to disable the drug.  Armed with this knowledge, scientists could tweak the drug to avoid resistance before it even occurs: they might sculpt the antibiotic's chemical shape, for example, or design a second medication that would stop the bacteria from degrading the antibiotic or pumping it out of the cell. But because the team looked at only a tiny fraction of the soil bacteria, there are probably many more ways of fighting antibiotics that have yet to be discovered, says Jo Handelsman who studies soil microbes at the University of Wisconsin, Madison. \"We have an enormous task ahead of us,\" she says. \n                   Antibiotics In Focus \n                 \n                   CDC Antibiotic resistance \n                 Reprints and Permissions"},

Munich Germany's universities are taking part in a contest that is intended to boost their global standing.

Despite being one of the world's largest economies, Germany's research universities punch below their weight in world rankings.

Daniel Guhr, founder of the Illuminate Consulting Group, based in San Diego, California, had been helping Berlin's Humboldt University to pep up its application.

And that institutes such as the Free University of Berlin and the University of W\u00fcrzburg in Bavaria \u2014 both with strong research programmes \u2014 do not have a fair chance because they are geographically close to the favourites, including Humboldt and the Technical University of Munich. \u201cIf the decision were solely about scientific excellence, a disproportionate share of the winners would be in southern Germany,\u201d he told  Nature . \u201cClearly, this would be hard to accept in Germany's federal system.\u201d Guhr adds that he sees such factors as \u201clegitimate and reasonable\u201d \u2014 without a political component to the decision, even the strongest universities in the east, for example, the University of Dresden, would have little chance.

Our ears could have started evolutionary life as a tube for breathing, say scientists, after examining the ancestral structure in a 370-million-year-old fossil fish. Evolutionary biologists are intrigued by how complicated sensory organs evolved from structures that may have had completely different uses in ancestral creatures. The bony structures in ancient fish, which at some point turned into ears, for example, appear to have had mainly a structural function, bracing the cheek and holding up the jaw. How exactly they made the transition to their role in hearing has proved a bit of a mystery. The ear is a relatively easy organ to study. Its evolving bones have been preserved as fossils, whereas the soft tissues of other specialized features, such as eyes and noses, have long decayed. So Martin Brazeau and Per Ahlberg of Uppsala University in Sweden decided to take a close look at the ear-like features of an ancient, metre-long monster from the Latvian Natural History Museum in Riga.  Panderichthys  was a fish, but is thought to be closely related to the earliest four-limbed tetrapods that eventually climbed on to land and gave rise to modern vertebrates. The researchers examined  Panderichthys  and found that the bony structures in its head combine features of fish and tetrapods, capturing a snapshot of evolution in action. \"It's neat to see that transition,\" says Hans Thewissen who studies the evolution of the ear and other organs at Northeastern Ohio Universities College of Medicine, Rootstown.  \n              Half-way house \n            Ancient fish have a narrow channel from the roof of the skull into the mouth, known as a spiracle, which is bounded by a long bone known as the hyomandibula that braces the cheek. In tetrapods, the equivalent bone is stubbier, a step towards the stirrup-like stapes bone that helps to transmit sound waves into our skulls.  The team found that  Panderichthys  has a wide, straight spiracle rather than a narrow one, and a shortened hyomandibula. They report their findings in  Nature 1 . Some have previously speculated that our ancient ears may have had a role in breathing.   On the basis of this new fossil evidence, the team speculates that the widened spiracle may have served  Panderichthys  much like the breathing holes used by modern-day sharks and rays. These allow the fish to inhale water over their gills while lying on the seabed, and avoid gulping in grit through the mouth. The demonstration of an organ evolving provides tangible evidence against the idea, put forward by some proponents of creationism, that sensory organs are so intricate that they must have been designed by a higher being. Brazeau says: \"It's a slap in the face to that kind of thinking.\" Reprints and Permissions"},

Can the popping of tiny bubbles trigger nuclear fusion, a potential source of almost unlimited energy? This controversial idea is back on the table, because its main proponent has new results that, he claims, will silence critics. But others say that the latest experiment simply comes with its own set of problems. The idea is simple enough. Blast a liquid with waves of ultrasound and tiny bubbles of gas are created, which release a burst of heat and light when they implode. The core of the bubble reaches 15,000 \u00b0C, hot enough to wrench molecules apart. Physicists have even suggested that the intense conditions of this sonoluminescence could fuse atomic nuclei together, in the same process that keeps our Sun running. Physicist Rusi Taleyarkhan of Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana, published the first evidence 1  of this 'sonofusion' in 2002; he has been dogged by sceptics ever since.  The underlying physics behind the idea is valid, says Ken Suslick. An expert in sonoluminescence at the University of Illinois in Urbana-Champaign, Suslick tried and failed to replicate Taleyarkhan's first results. If the bubbles' collapse is sufficiently intense, it should indeed be able to crush atoms together. Taleyarkhan just hasn't done enough to prove it, says Suslick.  \n              Needle in a haystack \n            Taleyarkhan's first experiments were conducted while he was based at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee. His idea was to use liquid acetone in which hydrogen atoms had been replaced by their heavier brethren, deuterium. When deuterium nuclei fuse together, they emit a characteristic burst of neutrons. But critics pointed out that Taleyarkhan was using an external source of neutrons to 'seed' the bubbles, and that these were swamping his measurements of neutrons produced by the fusion reaction itself. \"This time round there are no external neutrons,\" he explains. Instead, his team loaded a mixture of deuterated acetone and benzene with a uranium salt. As the uranium undergoes radioactive decay it releases alpha particles, which can also seed bubble formation, says Taleyarkhan. \"In this experiment we use three independent neutron detectors and a gamma-ray detector,\" he adds. The results from the four instruments prove that fusion is happening inside his experiment, asserts Taleyarkhan. Although uranium can release neutrons during fission reactions, Taleyarkhan rules them out because the neutrons he finds bear the energetic hallmark of having come from the fusion of two deuterium nuclei 2 . Taleyarkhan's test reactor still puts out a lot less energy than it takes in, making it impractical for generating power. \"We have a way to go before we break even,\" he admits. But in the meantime, he adds, it could be a cheap source of neutrons for analysing the structure of materials. The results are to be published in  Physical Review Letters  in a few weeks' time.  \n              Unreliable sources \n            There is one big problem, however: the experiment doesn't always work, and the group is not sure why. Seth Putterman, a physicist at the University of California, Los Angeles, who has also tried to verify some of Taleyarkhan's experiments, notes that the paper does not reveal how many failed runs were required before the team saw a trace of fusion neutrons. \"As a paper it doesn't convince me,\" says Putterman. Putterman notes that the team did not continuously monitor background neutron levels. Although the neutron count doubles at some points in the experiments, Putterman says that neutrons produced in random showers of cosmic rays, rather than fusion events, could be responsible. But Taleyarkhan points out that the neutron count was smaller in detectors further from the reaction chamber. To prove that the neutrons are coming from fusion as bubbles burst, Putterman and Suslick suggest that the team closely monitor exactly when the neutrons appear. The current experiment simply counts up the number of neutrons detected over minutes, so correlations with bubble bursts cannot be seen. \"The key to improving the signal is timing,\" says Putterman.  \n              Finding proof \n            Another obvious way to confirm that fusion is happening would be to look for tritium, a heavier isotope of hydrogen produced by fusion reactions. Tritium leaves a telltale signature of high-energy electrons when it decays and Taleyarkhan claimed to see this in similar previous experiments 1 , 3 . But in the current tests, tritium's signature is overwhelmed by ?-decay from the uranium, making it impossible to spot.  Given that Suslick and Putterman have both investigated Taleyarkhan's past claims, they think it odd that they were not consulted by the editors of  Physical Review Letters  about the paper. \"There are other people who are very knowledgeable about this,\" comments Martin Blume, editor-in-chief of the American Physical Society. Taleyarkhan says that Suslick and Putterman are welcome to visit his lab to see the results for themselves. Both are eager to go as soon as possible. \"We look forward to seeing the experiment run,\" says Putterman. \n                   Warm fusion \n                 \n                   Physical Review Letters \n                 \n                   ntroduction to Sonoluminescence \n                 Reprints and Permissions"},

Liou of the orbital debris programme at NASA's Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas. More than 9,000 man-made objects currently orbit the Earth, and about two-thirds of those are debris. This includes derelict satellites, spent rockets and fragments of metal from explosions. With an estimated 5,000 tonnes of stuff flying around up there, its not surprising that US Space Command tries to track everything bigger than 10 centimetres, the size thought to present a fatal risk to spacecraft. Liou and his colleague Nicholas Johnson used a computer model called LEGEND to predict what would happen to that space junk in the next 200 years, assuming that all space launches were halted in December 2004.

But after that, the number of dangerous objects begins to rise again, as pieces of junk collide with each other and break up into smaller, yet still potentially fatal fragments. Three such debris collisions are known to have happened since 1991 alone. The most recent, in January 2005, was between parts of a 31-year-old US rocket and a Chinese CZ-4 launch vehicle that exploded in March 2000. \"We only have one space,\" says Liou. \"If we don't protect the space environment we might get to a stage where we can't launch satellites.\" The results are reported in this week's  Science 1 .  \n              Homeward bound \n            For the past ten years, major space agencies have ensured than anything launched into space will come back down to Earth within 25 years of its mission end date. They do this either by adjusting the object's original orbit so that it will inevitably fall back down, or by using the last remnants of fuel to guide an object home. The pieces then burn up as they hurtle through the atmosphere. But that leaves many older satellites and pieces of junk still whizzing around. If we were to rely solely on gravity to bring these back to Earth, it would be thousands of years before space was clean again, says Liou. The area between 900 and 1,000 kilometres altitude sees the densest concentration of debris. LEGEND calculates that about 60% of all catastrophic collisions, between junk and craft travelling through the mess, will occur in that range. The number of objects in this region is projected to triple by 2200.   \n              Out of reach \n            None of the manned spacecraft currently in operation can reach beyond about 600 kilometres altitude, and the International Space Station orbits at just 350 kilometres. Although this means that they stay clear of the most dangerous zone, it also means that retrieving junk from further away will be extremely challenging. \"We don't have a simple and cheap way to do it,\" says Liou.  Robotic retrieval would be prohibitively expensive, and even the most powerful ground-based lasers don't have enough energy to nudge the junk into an orbit that will eventually bring it back to Earth. Before a solution can be found, researchers first need international officials to agree that something needs to be done, says Liou. Johnson will put the scientists' case to members of the United Nations Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space on 27 February in Vienna, Austria. \n                   Human Space Flight in focus \n                 \n                   More Physical Science stories \n                 \n                   Science \n                 \n                   NASA Orbital Debris Program Office \n                 Reprints and Permissions"},

If you're the type to stumble about as though drunk on first getting out of bed, scientists can now back up your behaviour as reasonable. A team has shown that people are as woozy when they wake as they are after drinking several beers. Sleep researchers have long been interested in the symptoms of sluggishness and disorientation that people experience after awakening, which they call sleep inertia. Now they have measured exactly how hopeless our early-morning brains are at carrying out everyday tasks. To do this, Kenneth Wright at the University of Colorado, Boulder, and his co-workers looked at the mental handicap caused by sleep inertia, and compared it with the detriment of having stayed up all night.  They allowed nine volunteers to enjoy roughly eight hours' nightly slumber for four weeks, the final week taking place in the lab. After a final pleasant night's sleep, they woke each person and immediately, without even a cup of coffee, asked them to calculate a string of sums. A minute after waking, they scored how many problems each one totted up correctly over two minutes. The test was then repeated after 20 minutes and again at regular intervals until the subjects had gone a full 26 hours without sleep.  \n              I'll be awake in a minute \n            Brain power was worse in the first few minutes after awakening than it was after a whole night's sleep deprivation, they report in the  Journal of the American Medical Association 1 . The individuals scored around 65% of their best ever performance when they first awoke, and 83% or better throughout the rest of the test period.  Wright says that the loss of brain power at daybreak is equivalent to that caused by a 0.08% blood alcohol level, which is typically reached after quaffing four bottles of beer. \"We haven't recognized in the past how bad it could be,\" Wright says. \"It is a little surprising.\" The study has implications for people who have to wake up and react immediately, such as doctors on call or resting aeroplane pilots roused in an emergency. These people should be made aware that they are operating severely below par, Wright says, so that they can wait a few minutes before making life-or-death decisions. Because the team studied people who were otherwise well-rested, the result also suggests that others, who are already sleep-deprived, might experience an even more precipitous drop in mental functions when they stir. So too might those waking from the deeper doze of a short nap.  \n              Just a few minutes more \n            Even for the average person, waiting for those first few minutes to pass, by lying in bed and avoiding any taxing tasks, might help avoid mishaps. It could also alleviate people's need for a morning cup of coffee, Wright suggests.  Sleep researchers are just beginning to explore what underlies and explains morning grogginess. A brain imaging study from 2002 showed that areas of the brain involved in problem solving and complex behaviours are particularly slow to rev up on awakening 2 . One idea is that sleep inertia may result from processes in the brain that normally work to keep us asleep and ensure that we have a good night's kip. Scientists now know it takes somewhere between one and twenty minutes to recover from the effects of sleep inertia. Next they need to figure out exactly how long this period is, and hence how long we need to fully wake up, says Derk-Jan Dijk, director of the Surrey Sleep Research Centre, UK. \"That's the crucial point,\" he says. \n                   JAMA \n                 Reprints and Permissions"},

During the height of his friendship with Woo Suk Hwang, Gerald Schatten took to calling the South Korean scientist his brother. Now, with Hwang's international disgrace sealed and that friendship dissolved, the scientific community has questions for the US researcher. Schatten is arguably one of the top achievers in cloning work with primates, thanks to research he collaborated on with Hwang and others.  He may also benefit from patent applications on cloning techniques behind the work; both Schatten and Hwang have filed patent applications, although Hwang's claims may be rejected given that the data supporting them are fraudulent.  \n              Monkey business \n            Schatten, a 56-year-old developmental biologist, directs a research institute affiliated with the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine in Pennsylvania. He has spent much of his scientific career trying to clone monkeys, to improve animal models of disease and inform studies of human stem-cell research.  But Schatten and others have had an extremely difficult time making such cloning work. In a 2003 study published in  Science 1 , the normally ebullient Schatten was so discouraged that he even speculated that reproductive cloning of monkeys would be impossible.  Less than a year later, however, good news from South Korea gave Schatten fresh hope. In a now infamous Science paper from February 2004, Hwang reported that he had cloned a human embryo and derived stem cells from it 2 . If it was possible in people, perhaps it was possible in their primate cousins. Schatten and Hwang started working together, and Hwang began sending researchers and technicians to Schatten's lab.  \n              A step forwards \n            The collaboration paid off for Schatten in December 2004, when he and Hwang reported that they had cloned a handful of monkey embryos from adult monkey skin cells (see ' Biologists come close to cloning primates ') . No live monkey clones were born, but the work was a huge step nonetheless 3 .   No one has raised explicit questions about the work yet, but given that Hwang is listed as a co-author some say it should be scrutinized. Schatten \"has to explain his role in this paper\", says developmental biologist Rudolf Jaenisch at the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research in Cambridge, Massachusetts. It is unclear, for example, whether the work was done entirely in the United States or in part in South Korea. \"It would be the only successful cloning of primates, if it's true,\" he adds. \"It needs to be investigated.\" Two co-authors of the paper, Duane Compton and Tanja Dominko, told Nature they had received no indication from Schatten that anything in the piece was questionable. Schatten declined an interview request from  Nature .  \n              Proof of method? \n            Schatten has said the monkey paper was partly a validation of Hwang's method of transferring cell nuclei. He crowed about the Korean team's contribution to his methodology in public: \"We could have been struggling for decades. Now our work is taking off fabulously. I think the whole world owes the Republic of Korea a debt of gratitude,\" Schatten told a reporter from the Associated Press last April. Now, scientists are keen to check if Hwang's methods work at all; in part by taking a hard look at the monkey studies. \"It seems like a logical place to go to see whether there's any validity to the technique itself,\" says Kevin Eggan, a developmental biologist at Harvard University.  In the meantime an investigation continues at Schatten's university. \"We are in the process of reviewing everything involving the Koreans' work and the University of Pittsburgh's investigatory panel is still deliberating. I don't anticipate an official statement coming from the university before the investigatory panel makes its report,\" wrote Jane Duffield, director of the medical school's press office, in an email to Nature on 6 January.   \n              Show me the money \n            The results of these investigations may also have some bearing on patent applications. Both Hwang and Schatten have patents pending on cloning techniques, neither of which name the other as a co-inventor.  Hwang filed an application in Korea in 2003, describing the innovations that he says allowed him to produce a stem-cell line from a cloned human embryo. It follows the structure of his discredited 2004 paper in  Science .  Schatten's application, filed in the United States in April 2004, is based on his monkey work, and identifies a method of overcoming a problem he says is encountered with transfer of cell nuclei in primates. It also covers a range of possible uses, including therapies developed from stem cells produced using particular techniques.   It is not clear how these claims will pan out. Both are based at least in part on previously established methods, says Margaret Sampson, a patent attorney at Vinson & Elkins in Austin, Texas. And other groups have applied for patents on cloning technologies. \"Neither Schatten nor Hwang will probably be the undisputed holders of all rights to the technology. It's more likely that different groups will hold patents on different methods of making and using stem cells,\" she says.  Whoever does end up with the patents might stand with a lot to gain. \n                   Hwang special \n                 Reprints and Permissions"},

As the world braces itself for a potential flu pandemic, experts are wrestling with the key question: whether the H5N1 virus is likely to evolve the ability to spread between people. Several researchers are arguing that the risk has been overplayed. But others are now attacking this view, stating that there is no evidence to support such a claim. H5N1 has led to the death or slaughter of hundreds of millions of poultry in Asia, and is spreading relentlessly among birds worldwide. It has killed about half of the 156 people so far identified as having been infected, and last week it claimed its first human victims outside Asia \u2014 at least two youngsters in a family in eastern Turkey (see  \u2018Bird flu takes its toll on Turkey\u2019 ). Despite the apparent threat, some virologists, including Peter Palese of the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York and Paul Offit of the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, believe that much of the attention focused on H5N1 is unwarranted. They argue that H5 viruses may be inherently incapable of transmitting efficiently from human to human. The viruses have had ample opportunity to mutate into a pandemic strain, they argue, and if they haven't already done so they probably never will. Of the 16 H subtypes of flu, only H1, H2 and H3 are known to have caused human pandemics, including the most recent ones in 1918, 1957 and 1968. \u201cThere is a possibility that another subtype may jump among people,\u201d Palese says. \u201cHowever, that has never been observed.\u201d But other experts have told  Nature  that this cannot be used to predict the chance of H5N1 or any future H5 strain triggering a pandemic, and that to state otherwise sows unnecessary confusion. So who is right? Much of Palese and Offit's argument stems from the idea that many asymptomatic cases of H5N1 have gone undetected. The reported death rate of about 50% is \u201ca complete exaggeration, and not scientifically justified\u201d, says Palese. \u201cIf there were indeed many other people infected without showing symptoms then Peter might have a point,\u201d says Albert Osterhaus, a virologist at the Erasmus Medical Center in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. But he says that is far from proved. Studies to find out how many people in the general population of affected countries have antibodies to H5N1 have only just started. Osterhaus says that the first, so far unpublished, results suggest that large numbers of poultry workers do not seem to have been infected. \u201cThe data we have suggest that the clinical cases are not the tip of the iceberg, but rather the only people who have been infected,\u201d he says. Palese argues that other evidence suggests H5 strains have been infecting humans from birds for decades. In particular, he cites a paper from 1992, which found H5 antibodies in 2\u20137% of the population in rural China (K. F. Shortridge  Semin. Respir. Infect.   7,  11\u201325; 1992). There is no reason then to believe that an H5 virus should suddenly trigger a pandemic now, he says. Edward Holmes, who studies virus evolution at Pennsylvania State University, is unconvinced by Palese's argument. \u201cI don't think you can say that it should have happened already,\u201d he says. \u201cThe history of evolution is that rare things can happen.\u201d And in unpublished work, Yi Guan of the University of Hong Kong, who worked on the 1992 study, says that his group has since tested 4,000 blood samples collected in southern China in 2001 and found no antibodies against H5 viruses. Experimental evidence about whether H5N1 could spread between people is also lacking. Although scientists are beginning to understand what genes make flu viruses pathogenic, they know little about what determines their transmissibility. Where a virus is excreted from seems to be one factor. Viruses infecting the upper respiratory tract, for example, are thought to jump more easily than those lower down. But scientists aren't sure about this with H5N1, as only a handful of autopsies have been done on human victims, largely because of religious concerns in the relevant countries. Another way to study the question would be to study viruses such as the 1918 flu strain in mammals, replacing the genes one at a time to investigate their roles in transmissibility. This work hasn't been done either, because such dangerous viruses are strictly regulated. More data are desperately needed, says Holmes, and in the meantime we should not assume that H5N1 won't cause a pandemic. \u201cTrying to put numbers on how long it is going to take or how many people are going to die is a pointless exercise. We scientists should just hold up our hands and say we don't know what is going to happen.\u201d Palese himself accepts this view as reasonable. \u201cOK; that I can agree with,\u201d he says. Palese also strongly supports the need for better surveillance and research. Whatever he thinks about H5N1, he emphasizes that further flu pandemics are inevitable. His views have been picked up by the media as evidence that the pandemic threat is being hyped, but Palese argues that the need to prepare has not been driven home strongly enough: \u201cPeople are just not willing to accept that we are not doing enough across the board \u2014 in research, surveillance or in developing vaccines.\u201d \n                     Mashups mix data into global service \n                   \n                     Bird flu takes lives in Turkey \n                   \n                     Deadly flu virus can be sent through the mail \n                   \n                     The 1918 flu virus is resurrected \n                   \n                     Influenza: lessons from past pandemics, warnings from current incidents \n                   \n                     Avian flu special: Avian flu: Are we ready? \n                   \n                     Google Earth map of avian flu outbreaks (download Google Earth first) \n                   \n                     Avian Flu web focus \n                   \n                     Bird Flu in focus \n                   \n                     Google Earth \n                   \n                     World Health Organization Avian Influenza page \n                   \n                     Connotea web resources \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Munich The startling discovery that terrestrial plants produce the greenhouse gas methane is sending scientists in two disciplines, not to mention a few politicians, back to the drawing board. The newly revealed methane emissions have taken plant physiologists by surprise, because far more energy is required to create methane than, say, carbon dioxide in an oxygenated environment. Climate researchers are also amazed that they could have missed what is potentially a huge methane source \u2014 up to a third of all methane produced worldwide (see  \u2018How could we have missed this?\u2019 ). Until now, it was thought that plant matter produces methane only through microbial activity in oxygen-free environments such as swamps, flooded rice fields and ruminants' guts. But on  page 187  of this issue, Frank Keppler, a geochemist at the Max Planck Institute for Nuclear Physics in Heidelberg, Germany, and his colleagues report that grasses and leaves from various species release the gas under normal aerobic conditions. The source of the methane \u2014 and why plants make it \u2014 is unknown. Some species make other volatile hydrocarbons such as isoprene, but that reaction involves a specific enzyme, and only seems to kick in when the plants need to dissipate excess energy. The methane emissions that Keppler found rise smoothly with temperature up to 70 \u00b0C, suggesting that no enzyme is involved. \u201cThis seems to be a secondary chemical reaction with no specific function for plant metabolism,\u201d says Elmar Weiler, a plant physiologist at Ruhr University in Bochum, Germany. \u201cIt's a truly surprising finding.\u201d But beyond its implications for botany, the discovery could prove important for understanding and predicting climate change \u2014 and for our attempts to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions. Methane is the second most important greenhouse gas in the atmosphere after carbon dioxide, and levels have doubled over the past 200 years, mainly as a result of increased agricultural activity. The finding doesn't change ideas about the total amount of methane being released into the atmosphere. But scientists had thought they knew about all the significant methane sources and how much each contributed (see  Global change: A green source of surprise ). Now it seems that their figures were very wrong. As a rough estimate, Keppler reckons that global vegetation may be releasing between 60 million and 240 million tonnes of methane each year \u2014 up to a third of the total amount that enters the atmosphere. \u201cThe surprising thing to me is the amount of methane they found,\u201d says Martin Heimann, director of the Max Planck Institute for Biogeochemistry in Jena, Germany. \u201cIt means we neglected a big driving force for the climate.\u201d It is too early to say exactly how the revelation might influence predictions for future climate change, but it's unlikely to be good news. The fact that plant methane emissions rise with temperature, and that plants are likely to grow faster in a warmer climate anyway, could lead to a big rise in methane emissions from natural sources, says Johannes Lelieveld, an atmospheric researcher at the Max Planck Institute for Chemistry in Mainz, Germany. The finding also restricts our options for reducing methane emissions, he points out, because measures such as growing rice in drier fields are likely to prove less effective than had been thought. \u201cIf natural greenhouse-gas sources are greater than we thought, the scope for climate politics becomes narrower,\u201d he says. \u201cYou wouldn't cut down forests just because trees release methane.\u201d \n                 Additional reporting by Mark Peplow. \n               \n                     Greenhouse gases level off \n                   \n                     Rapid climate change: Gas leak! \n                   \n                     Climate change: That sinking feeling \n                   \n                     In focus climate change \n                   \n                     Goddard Institute for Space Studies \n                   \n                     US Environmental Protection Agency on methane \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Seoul The results are in. The university committee looking into scientific misconduct in the laboratory of South Korean cloner Woo Suk Hwang announced on 10 January that his 2004 claim to have cloned a human embryo was fake. But his Afghan hound Snuppy is a real clone. The announcement finally confirms the gravest suspicions of Hwang's work with humans. There are two papers in which Hwang's group claimed to clone human cells \u2014 a 2004 article that describes the first cloned embryo and derivation of a stem-cell line from it (W. S. Hwang  et al .  Science   303,  1669\u20131674; 2004), and a 2005 article that claims the establishment of eleven \u2018patient-specific\u2019 stem-cell lines (W. S. Hwang  et al .  Science   308,  1777\u20131783; 2005). Both have turned out to be complete and deliberate fakes. \u201cSuch an act is nothing other than deception of the scientific community and the public at large,\u201d concludes Myung Hee Chung of Seoul National University (SNU), who headed the committee. With the 2005 paper already discredited in the panel's interim report (see  Nature ,  439 , 8; 2005 ), Chung's statement focused on the 2004 paper. DNA fingerprinting tests carried out by three laboratories found that the genetic material of the supposedly cloned human cell line, NT-1, did not match that of the donor. Nor did it match any of the stem-cell lines from the  in vitro  fertilization (IVF) embryos of MizMedi Hospital, which were the source for the faked data in the 2005 paper. Further investigation revealed that mitochondrial DNA from the cell line matched one of the egg donors, but the DNA inside the cells' nuclei varied at several locations. The committee concluded that the line was derived by parthenogenesis \u2014 where the single set of chromosomes in an egg develop as if it were fertilized. The images and data in the paper that showed perfect matches were fabricated. The committee also found that Hwang worked with a staggering number of eggs \u2014 2,061 from 129 women \u2014 despite claiming to have used only 242 eggs for the 2004 study and 185 for the 2005 study. The findings are a huge setback for therapeutic cloning \u2014 the idea that cloned embryos could be used as a source of patient-matched stem cells to replace damaged tissues in a range of diseases. Even using numbers of human eggs of which other researchers can only dream, Hwang's team was unable to derive such stem cells, and the field is now left with no evidence that it is possible in humans at all (see  Nature ,  438 , 1056\u20131059; 2005). The committee did find that Hwang succeeded in cloning human embryos to the blastocyst stage, from which stem cells can be derived. But the success rate was just 10%, and they were \u201cin poor condition\u201d. The only other group to have some success, Alison Murdoch's team at the University of Newcastle upon Tyne, UK, has cloned just a single blastocyst (M. Stojkovic  et al .  Reprod. BioMed. Online   11,  226\u2013231; 2005). It is possible to create embryonic stem-cell lines, insists Kevin Eggan, a researcher in the field at Harvard University, Massachusetts. But no one will venture a guess as to when it might be accomplished. \u201cThere are many unknowns,\u201d says Eggan. \u201cWe don't know how many eggs will be needed and we don't know how many women will step forward to contribute.\u201d Ethical transgressions in the way Hwang got his eggs \u2014 he seems to have coerced junior researchers into donating \u2014 have stimulated an international debate over how eggs should be obtained. Eggan expects to gain approval this spring to begin human stem-cell cloning research, and he says his group will follow the US National Academies' guidelines. These stipulate that egg donors should receive no payment. Even when admitting faked data, Hwang has maintained that his human cloning techniques are valid. But most experts say they merely involve tweaks to previously known methods, such as squeezing the nucleus out of cells rather than sucking them out with a needle. \u201cBesides some slight adjustments, there was really nothing new,\u201d says Teruhiko Wakayama of the Center for Developmental Biology in Kobe, Japan, who created the first mouse clones in 1998. Many experts conclude that Hwang's greatest achievement was Snuppy, the first cloned dog (B. C. Lee  et al .  Nature   436 , 641; 2005). The SNU investigators verified Snuppy's identity as a clone by proving that he had the same nuclear DNA as the skin-cell donor and the same mitochondrial DNA as the egg donor \u2014 a conclusion that was confirmed on 10 January by  Nature 's own investigation. Dog ovulation produces very immature eggs, so culturing them is difficult, even for basic IVF, says Wakayama. \u201cIf it's real, this is their greatest accomplishment,\u201d he says. The SNU committee also noted that Hwang \u2014 originally trained as a veterinarian \u2014 showed greatest skill when it came to cloning animals, notably pigs and cows. As  Nature  went to press, however, the Munhwa Broadcasting Corporation, which originally accused Hwang of faking his data, was about to air a television programme questioning Hwang's claim to have cloned a cow \u2014 the work that first shot him to fame in South Korea. The SNU committee said it was unable to confirm whether the cow was a clone because Hwang did not cooperate with them. The committee, which issued a 50-page report covering the investigation, stopped short of accusing Hwang or other individuals on the team of deliberate fabrication. It deferred to national prosecutors who will now look into legal aspects of the case and the possibility of fraud. Hwang received huge funding from the Korean government for his work, including an annual stipend of US$3 million, which he started receiving this year as the country's \u201csupreme scientist\u201d. The Chung committee did report, however, that Hwang was lying when he said in November that he did not know about egg donations by his lab members. \u201cHwang accompanied the student to the hospital himself,\u201d the report says. Hwang later circulated a form asking for voluntary egg donation and collected signatures from female technicians. While the committee delivered its report, a small group of supporters at the university entrance held up signs demanding that Hwang be given a chance to prove himself. \u201cWe'll put the smile back on your face,\u201d read the slogan on a familiar billboard calling Hwang the \u201cPride of Korea\u201d. Chung does not agree. Hwang's team, he says, \u201ccannot represent science in Korea\u201d.

In February 2004, an obscure laboratory in South Korea dropped a bomb on the scientific community: it had cloned a human embryo and extracted stem cells from it. What followed over the next two years makes for an extraordinary tale of delusion and deception. Even now, as the press gathers in South Korea to hear the final conclusions of the investigating board that has picked apart the case, the extent of the fakery is unknown. More importantly, the motivation behind this startling fraud is still clouded in mystery. But back in early 2004, the technical feat announced by Woo Suk Hwang meant nothing less than a huge leap towards the clinical application of therapeutic cloning, a technology that many hope will one day bring a cure for diseases such as Parkinson's. The achievement was quickly embraced by scientists and journalists alike.  The success was in itself unsurprising. Most people assumed that humans would be clonable in a similar way to sheep, mice, cows and other mammals before them. And the paper used slight variations on very conventional methods, making the familiar ideas easy to digest.  \"It was not so amazing to imagine that somatic cell nuclear transfer might well work in the human, if investigators were diligent enough and had access to the appropriate clinical material,\" says Martin Pera of Monash University in Australia. And Hwang's laboratory had resources that no one else had. The 2004 achievement was done with 242 eggs from voluntary donors, a number that others had found impossible to collect. When people visited the previously low-key lab, they realized that this was no garage operation. Hwang's shiny new facilities and army of capable technicians made it seem a natural leader in the field. Researchers said that other countries would have to redouble their efforts, and their funding, to stay competitive.  \n              Nagging doubts \n            At first, the main questions raised about Hwang's work were how he got his eggs. A  Nature  news article in May 2005 provided evidence that researchers had been egg donors; allowing junior members of a team to undergo a painful and potentially risky procedure is considered ethically dubious by some.  Any doubts about the science itself were muted. A short phrase in Hwang's 2004 paper raised the possibility that the cell line may have been created by parthenogenesis, the stimulation of an egg to develop into an embryo, rather than cloning. But Hwang presented DNA fingerprints as evidence, which experts said lessened this possibility. It was easy to believe that the finding was real. However, that DNA-fingerprint data, and other evidence supporting the existence of a clone, turned out to be fake. The cell line was derived from a parthenogenetic embryo, a Seoul National University committee reported on 10 January 2006.   \n              But why? \n           Why would Hwang have faked data? Hak Soo Han, a producer at PD Notebook, a well-known Munhwa Broadcasting Corporation (MBC) news programme that produced crucial evidence against Hwang, says Hwang was under severe pressure. The achievements that had given him stardom in Korea, such as the cloning of a cow in 1999, did not have peer-reviewed publication as support. To have results on human cloning published in a top journal would \"shatter all doubts for good,\" says Han.  Some have speculated that other aspects of Korean culture may have driven that pressure home. \"People say Koreans are expected to do everything fast,\" says Han, but he thinks this case is more specific. \"This was Hwang's personal desire.\"  \"It is possible to point to the pressures to deliver results in a high-profile field such as this, but many others operate honestly under those pressures all the time,\" notes Pera.  Perhaps Hwang assumed that someone, perhaps himself, would reproduce the results more convincingly later. But this confirmation did not come.  \n              Try, try again \n            As others did not replicate Hwang's work, it was thought that this was because other labs were missing the access to eggs, or the dexterity of Hwang's technicians. But as time passed, pressure grew for Hwang to reproduce it themselves and move forwards.  \"He was expected to get a patent and to make this medically applicable,\" says Han. \"And they knew they would have difficulty getting that with the possibility of parthenogenesis still lingering.\"  When the next publication came, it surprised even those convinced of Hwang's ability. He announced the creation of 11 stem-cell lines tailored to patients, male and female, young and old. The paper ruled out the possibility of parthenogenesis and showed a startling increase in efficiency of stem-cell production. \"The 2005 paper was a shock because of the success rate reported, but again the quality of the journal and additional authors gave it further credibility,\" says Alan Trounson, a a reproductive biologist at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia.  \n              Fall of a giant \n            But slowly the threads started to unravel. In June 2005, MBC producers received a tip-off by e-mail from someone formerly in Hwang's laboratory calling into question the 2005 results on the basis of his experience with the 2004 paper. PD Notebook quickly started investigating.  Han says the learning curve for him and his team was startling. They had never heard of words such as 'teratoma' and 'pluripotency', which would soon be scattered throughout the world's press, in good part thanks to their own investigations. Through the help of whistle-blowers and journalist investigations, more and more came to light. Shows aired by PD Notebook in October and November made damning allegations. On 24 November Hwang made his first confession, admitting that paid donors' and lab members' eggs were used, though he denied prior knowledge of it.  \n              Standing by \n            Koreans, including those close to President Moo Hyun Roh, supported Hwang and attacked MBC. The show cancelled the programme that would give evidence that Hwang's 2005 data didn't match up. But the word was out. Young scientists had already begun to dissect data (including massive supplementary data sets of DNA fingerprints and stained cell images) and to post speculation about it anonymously on websites. 'Errors' cropped up one after another. A Seoul National University investigative committee stepped in and, on 10 January, announced that all of Hwang's human data had been fabricated.  Hwang has not made a formal public statement since 16 December, when he recognized flaws in the data but insisted that he had true patient-matched stem cells and the technology to create more. At his once-bustling laboratory, the doors are locked. Camera crews wait outside in the cold for something to happen, but Hwang is now staying away from the public eye. At the gate of Seoul National University, supporters still hold signs demanding that Hwang be given six months to prove that his techniques work, even if the data supporting his published work were fake. But as federal prosecutors today begin an investigation into Hwang for fraud, it seems a remote possibility that he will be back in the lab soon. Reprints and Permissions"},

Washington DC US campaigners against capital punishment are hoping that modern DNA tests in old cases will undermine public confidence in the death penalty. In the next few weeks, genetic testing of an old sample could show that Roger Keith Coleman \u2014 executed in 1992 for rape and murder \u2014 was not guilty. The tests are being conducted at Canada's Centre of Forensic Sciences in Toronto, and were requested by the state of Virginia's governor, Mark Warner. If Coleman is exonerated, it will be the first time that genetic evidence is used to prove that the US death penalty has killed an innocent person. Coleman was convicted in Virginia for the 1981 murder of his sister-in-law. The sample being tested was gathered in 1990 as part of an unsuccessful attempt to clear his name. In ordering the recent tests, Warner \u2014 a Democrat widely expected to run for president in 2008 \u2014 called Coleman's case \u201can extraordinarily unique circumstance, where technology has advanced significantly and can be applied in the case of someone who consistently maintained his innocence until execution\u201d. Only once before in the United States has DNA been tested in a case where the prisoner had already been executed. The tests, performed in 2000, were inconclusive about the guilt of the Georgia man, Ellis Felker, who had been executed four years earlier. But modern DNA tests have successfully exonerated some Virginia prisoners. Between 2002 and 2004, three people were cleared after tests were done on old biological samples, saved by a methodical employee in the era before such techniques were available. As a result, Warner asked for tests on a random 10% of all the samples that had been saved. Out of thousands of cases, there were 29 in which current DNA tests could have shown guilt or innocence. Two of the 29 were shown to be innocent and their convictions overturned. Warner has now announced that the rest of the samples will also be tested, calling this \u201cthe only morally acceptable course\u201d. Ellen Qualls, the governor's communications director, says that a rough extrapolation from the test results suggests there may be 20 or 30 exonerations from around 300 pertinent cases \u2014 an error rate that some would argue is unacceptable for a state that allows capital punishment. The US public has long been divided over the death penalty. Each state decides whether to administer it or not: 38 states allow people to be sentenced to death, and Illinois has suspended executions while it examines the issue. Proof that innocents have died would certainly strengthen arguments against the penalty. The issue of wrongful convictions does not apply just to cases that pre-date DNA testing. A growing scandal in Texas serves as a reminder that genetic tests are only as reliable as those carrying them out. On 4 January, a damning report was published on the Houston Police Department's crime laboratory. The DNA unit of the Texas lab was closed in 2002, after a series of expos\u00e9s by local television news station KHOU. Now, an independent investigation, which has looked at 1,100 cases so far, charges the lab with problems including contamination of samples, misrepresentation of statistics in court and failure to use controls. In two cases, one of which put a man on death row, a clear absence of the suspect's genetic markers in a sample was called \u201cinconclusive\u201d and not reported. Investigators blamed lack of funding and inept management, among other factors. \u201cThe complete lack of outside scrutiny of the crime lab's operations, procedures, and reporting of results allowed serious deficiencies...to become so egregious that analysts in the lab simply had no perspective on how bad their practices were,\u201d the report reads. DNA analysed at the lab is being retested, and at least one person has been freed. Nearly 95% of US police crime laboratories are accredited by a board that maintains national standards. Ralph Keaton, head of the accreditation project, says that Houston's experience is the exception rather than the rule. \u201cFrom the beginning,\u201d he says, \u201cDNA evidence has been carefully scrutinized because it is so powerful.\u201d \n                     World Trade Centre forensics break new ground \n                   \n                     Forensic science \n                   \n                     The many dangers of relying on a DNA database \n                   \n                     DNA, not d.o.a. \n                   \n                     \n                         Governor Warner release on Coleman case \n                       \n                   \n                     Time Magazine cover of Coleman \n                   \n                     Houston Independent Investigator's report \n                   \n                     Houston Independent Investigator's main site \n                   \n                     National Institute of Justice  Recommendations for post-conviction DNA testing \n                   \n                     Koshland Science Museum: putting DNA to work \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Here,  news@nature   compiles a guide to the main characters in a major stem-cell scandal, at the centre of which stands South Korean scientist Woo Suk Hwang. After Hwang published work claiming his team had extracted patient-matched stem cells from cloned embryos, it was shown to be a complete fake. For all our news stories and a timeline of events see our  special on Hwang .  \n              Woo Suk Hwang  \n           Hwang grew up in a poor village in Korea (see ' Profile: Woo-Suk Hwang '). He became a veterinarian who later turned to medical science, hoping, he has told  Nature , to improve the lot of his countrymen. He created the country's first cow born from in vitro fertilization in 1993, then became something of a national hero after cloning one in 1999. Hwang went on to try to clone an endangered tiger, tried his hand at pigs, and even claimed to have developed a cow resistant to mad cow disease in 2003. Critics point out that many of Hwang's early cloning achievements, including his cow, were not supported by journal publications. Then, in 2004,  Science   published a paper by Hwang reporting the first stem-cell line derived from a cloned human embryo, and in 2005 a paper claiming that he had created patient-specific stem cells. The work shot him to international fame, and then infamy.  \n              Korean scientists \n           Korea's young scientist community came alive in late 2005, albeit anonymously. Websites such as those of the Biological Research Information Center and Scieng are clearing houses for science-related news, often of the mundane variety. But in early December 2005, the 'netizens' started posting doubts about DNA fingerprints and images in Hwang's papers. In a situation where it was difficult to criticize a top scientist, especially one who had ties stretching up to the president of the country, these anonymous portals offered freedom of speech and provided vital information for investigators of the case.  \n              Journalists \n           As early as May 2004,  Nature   presented doubts about Hwang's research, in an article that questioned the ethical integrity of his source of eggs. The article was roundly condemned by Hwang and the South Korean press.  Nature   expected an official investigation, but none came. Then, in 2005, an investigative programme from the Munhwa Broadcasting Company (MBC), played a vital role exposing Hwang.  PD Notebook  's previous targets included such giants as the national intelligence agency. But Hwang was the hardest fish to fry, says 36-year-old producer and reporter Hak Soo Han.  PD Notebook  's programme about Hwang's egg procurement on 22 November led to a confession from Hwang two days later. Further evidence gathered by the programme concerning his scientific papers was crucial in sparking official investigations.  \n              The egg donors \n           Hwang told  Nature   he had not used eggs from paid donors or laboratory members. But it turns out that of 129 known donors (only 34 of which were noted in his papers), many were paid and at least two, Ja Min Koo and Eul Soon, were workers in his own laboratory. A investigative committee from Seoul National University reported that not only did Hwang know of one woman's donation, he accompanied her to the hospital.   Ja Min Koo   is a 35-year-old mother of two who had been working as a PhD student with Hwang since the late 1990s. She had previously worked culturing egg cells from pigs, which prepared her for working on human cells for Hwang's 2004  Science   paper, on which she is a co-author. She told  Nature   that she was a donor in spring 2004, saying she was happy to contribute to the drive for cures for spinal-cord injuries.    Eul Soon Park   was a research fellow in Hwang's laboratory and co-author on Hwang's 2004  Science   paper. She helped to develop the method that Hwang's lab uses to remove an intact nucleus from an egg, by squeezing it out rather than sucking it with a needle. The method was also used in monkey cloning research at Gerald Schatten's laboratory in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, to which Park moved in 2004. It has been questioned whether her egg donation was voluntary, or if she was pressured after hundreds of eggs were ruined in early experiments.  \n              The whistle-blowers \n            In June 2005, a former member of Hwang's laboratory tipped off MBC producers to the possibility that the 2005  Science   paper was a fake. Another one gave  PD Notebook   stem-cell line number 2, one of 11 cells supposedly tailored to a patient, and told them to test it. A third informer backed up some of MBC's information. \"These informers were worried about the future of Korean science,\" says producer Han. Friction between members of the lab, he adds, did not seem to be an issue.    Sung Il Roh   is a senior fertility expert at MizMedi Hospital. Roh secured at least 1,200 eggs for Hwang's experiments. He told  Nature   he comes from a long line of fertility specialists and did not need the kudos of being associated with the 2004  Science   paper: he says he turned down co-authorship. He was, however, second author on the 2005  Science   paper. In November, he publicly admitted that egg donors were paid, later adding a claim that Hwang knew about it. On 16 December he broke down in tears at a press conference in which he accused Hwang of fabricating data.    Sun Jong Kim   is a researcher in his mid-30s, and co-author on both  Science   papers. He has said that he doctored photos for the papers at Hwang's behest, telling MBC that he had produced images for eleven lines from two that he was give from Hwang. Hwang later accused Kim or others of switching lines.  Nature   awaits the outcome of further investigation. Hwang, Roh, Kim and others remain in South Korea under a travel ban while prosecutors investigate.  \n              Curie Ahn  \n            A xenotransplant expert at Seoul National University, Ahn has told  Nature   she one day hopes to make pig organs that could solve the organ donor crisis. She was one of Hwang's most ardent supporters throughout 2004 and 2005, and became an unofficial spokeswoman when he was not in contact with the media. She later distanced herself, telling  Nature   that her role was limited to developing the cell lines produced by Hwang for clinical applications.  \n              Gerald Schatten \n            This energetic, 56-year-old developmental biologist has long sought to unravel the secrets of cloning in primates. In 2001, he led the creation of the world's first genetically modified monkey, while at the Oregon Health and Science University in Portland. Later that year, he was recruited to lead a research institute at the University of Pittsburgh Medical School, where he still works today. His investigations into monkey cloning led him to seek advice from Hwang; their collaboration resulted in co-authorship, with others, of the 2005  Science   paper. Schatten was also involved with the 2004  Science   paper. The effusive Schatten often served as Hwang's ambassador in the West. Later, he publicly distanced himself from Hwang, and his comments helped to spur investigations into the research.  \n              Ky Young Park \n            A former plant biologist turned consumer-advocate in areas related to genetically modified organisms, Park is co-author on the 2004  Science   paper. But her professional role as a bioethicist, she has told  Nature , is limited to surveying people's attitudes on cloning and other biomolecular techniques, not including issues such as egg donation. Some suspect she was added to the paper for political reasons: Park later became science and technology adviser to South Korea's president, and a great supporter of Hwang's research. On 9 January, following the release of Seoul National University's investigation, which found that the 2004 paper was a fabrication, Park announced that she would resign as adviser. The Science Minister is also being replaced following the scandal.  \n              Investigative panel \n           Seoul National University set up a nine-member committee, led by pharmacologist Myung Hee Chung from the College of Medicine, to investigate Hwang's lab. The panel was established after problems were highlighted in December 2005; it quickly filed both preliminary and final reports. After its first discovery of fraud in Hwang's papers, Hwang and his supporters accused the committee of bias and lack of expertise.  Nature   has no reason to think this is the case. \n             Additional reporting by Erika Check  \n           \n                   Hwang special \n                 \n                   Biological Research Information Center \n                 \n                   Scieng (in Korean) \n                 Reprints and Permissions"},

Paris Bernard Meunier, president of France's basic-research agency, the CNRS, resigned on 5 January. The move brings to a head simmering internal tensions over the future of the 26,000-member body. The CNRS has declined to comment on the resignation, apart from issuing a short statement by Meunier. In it, he makes public his disagreement over the reform plans of the agency's director-general, mathematician Bernard Larrouturou. In principle, the president defines the general goals of CNRS policy and the director-general carries them through, but in practice the latter holds the reins of power. The reforms came into force on 1 January. They are meant to encourage multidisciplinarity, wealth creation, the development of labs outside Paris, and tighter links with French universities. The structural reforms are due to be completed later this year by a \u2018strategic plan\u2019 that will lay out future policies in more detail. As a result of the reform, the CNRS's eight existing departments have been regrouped into four broad departments \u2014 life sciences, chemistry, humanities, and maths and physics \u2014 and two \u2018cross-cutting\u2019 departments \u2014 engineering and the environment, and sustainable development. Meunier, a chemist, regards Larrouturou's reforms as unnecessary management interference that he believes will weaken science at the agency. He thinks that the new configuration of departments would complicate rather than simplify matters, with laboratories often belonging to several different departments at once, and he questions how the cross-cutting departments would work. The reforms also create five regional CNRS boards, and Meunier argues that this would add an unnecessary layer of bureaucracy, and hand excessive power to the regions, weakening scientific imperatives from central management. \u201cHe feels that it risks creating five little CNRSs,\u201d says Jacques Fossey, a chemist who is head of the research union SNCS and a member of the CNRS board of directors. In his resignation statement, Meunier slams the reforms as \u201can excessively administrative network\u201d and not the \u201csimple and dynamic mode of functioning\u201d that the agency needs. He adds that he hopes his resignation will lead to a new team that is \u201cmore adapted to the actions the CNRS needs to take to assure its place in French and European research\u201d. Fossey believes Meunier intended to provoke a crisis, gambling that this would force the government to remove Larrouturou and appoint a new management team. The upset comes just as the research agency's dominant role in French science is in question. The CNRS funds its own labs, but research will increasingly be driven by competitive grant proposals administered by the National Research Agency, a body set up last year with an initial budget of \u20ac350 million (US$423 million), which will rise to \u20ac1.5 billion by 2010. The CNRS's power would be further reduced by a long-awaited research and innovation reform bill, due to be voted on by the National Assembly next month. This would create a national Agency for Research Evaluation, responsible for looking at all research agencies, labs and scientists, a job currently done by the CNRS national committee. As  Nature  went to press, the French government was tipped to appoint as Meunier's successor Catherine Br\u00e9chignac, a physicist and president-elect of the Paris-based International Council for Science. Br\u00e9chignac was director-general of the CNRS from 1997 to 2000, and earned a reputation as a staunch defender of the agency's autonomy. \n                     French government concedes defeat to researchers \n                   \n                     Rebelling scientists welcome left's landslide in France \n                   \n                     Time for a French revolution \n                   \n                     CNRS gets first woman director general \n                   \n                     CNRS \n                   \n                     L'Agence nationale de la recherch\u00e9 \n                   \n                     French science ministry \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Should wild animals be reintroduced into areas where they have become extinct? In recent years, the issue has split European conservationists and farmers, who disagree over the future of species such as wolves. Now the unexpected arrival of a tiny population of owls in Britain has divided even advocates of conservation. The breeding pair of eagle owls ( Bubo bubo ) first attracted attention last autumn, when they featured in a television documentary. Many ornithologists believe that the birds, which have a wingspan of two metres, haven't lived in Britain since the last ice age, 10,000 years ago. The owls are fearsome hunters, happy to dine on mammals \u2014 sometimes as large as small deer \u2014 or on other birds of prey. The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds is calling on the British government to monitor the new arrivals, resident in Yorkshire in northern England, in case the population grows. The society is worried that the owls might start to kill significant numbers of endangered species, such as black grouse and hen harriers. But some researchers argue that eagle owls should be protected as native birds. John Stewart, a palaeontologist at University College London, says fossil evidence suggests that the owls survived previous ice ages. He argues that remains from the past 10,000 years should be taken as evidence that the owls existed in the wild \u2014 ornithologists had previously assumed that the remains came from tame eagle owls that had been imported for hunting. \u201cIf you look at the owls' distribution around Europe, it is like that of other animals such as wolves and beavers that have been pushed out of northwest Europe,\u201d adds Stewart. \u201cIt's churlish to suggest that they don't belong here.\u201d If he is right, eagle owls could be added to the British List, the register of birds recorded in recent times in Britain and Ireland. This would give them the right to be protected, and perhaps even actively reintroduced. But Tim Melling, secretary of the records committee at the British Ornithologists' Union, which compiles the list, says he is not convinced by Stewart's points. Melling says he and colleagues have reviewed every published British bird book and found no evidence for an established population of eagle owls. He points out that the birds have been popular pets for hundreds of years and that reports of wild eagle owls often note that the animals are unusually tame. A similar debate over belonging was ignited last year by carbon dating of bones of the Eurasian lynx ( Lynx lynx ) from caves in Yorkshire. The lynx was thought to have died out in Britain several thousand years ago, when climate change turned much of its forest habitat into boggy peatlands. But the bones were just 1,500 years old, suggesting that recent human activity was responsible for the animals' demise. The result was a boost for conservationists wanting to bring the lynx back to Britain, including David Hetherington, who led the carbon-dating study at the University of Aberdeen. He suggests that forestry projects and deer in the Scottish Highlands would provide suitable habitat and prey. But whatever the fossil evidence, any reintroduction needs local backing, cautions Toby Aykroyd, vice-chairman of the Wilderness Foundation, a charity based in Chelmsford, Essex. Farmers in France have protested against the return of wolves, which prey on livestock. And beavers, which have been successfully reintroduced in many European countries, have proved controversial in Britain: farmers fear they will be not be allowed to remove the animals from their land. \n                     Will big cats bounce back? \n                   \n                     Wolf attack map predicts danger areas \n                   \n                     British Ornithologists' Union \n                   \n                     The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Washington DC Los Alamos National Laboratory will be under fresh management from June. But staff wonder whether their new bosses will help the lab move on from the scandals that have dogged it in the past decade. On 21 December, the US Department of Energy announced that the University of California would continue to run the New Mexico institution as part of a consortium that also includes three private companies. In a competition for the lab, it beat a partnership between the University of Texas and defence contractor Lockheed Martin. Los Alamos has been run by the University of California since it was set up to develop the atomic bomb during the Second World War. The competition was the first in the lab's history, and was triggered by a series of security scandals, including charges of espionage, an industrial accident and reportedly missing computer disks that caused a three-month shutdown in 2004 (see  Nature   433 , 437; 2005). In announcing the management change, energy department officials were quick to reassure employees who are tired of the recurrent problems. \u201cI cannot stress enough that this is a new contract, with a new team, marking a new approach at Los Alamos,\u201d said Samuel Bodman, the US energy secretary. Along with the University of California, the consortium \u2014 called Los Alamos National Security LLC \u2014 consists of Bechtel, BWX Technologies and Washington Group International, which are all nuclear-facilities contractors. Some employees think that it will therefore concentrate on nuclear weapons at the expense of basic science. \u201cThere is a lot of concern that Los Alamos would become nothing more than a plutonium factory,\u201d says Doug Roberts, who recently retired from Los Alamos and runs a widely read blog about the lab. Michael Anastasio, the lab's new director, has tried to allay such concerns. \u201cThis is not a de-emphasis on science,\u201d says Anastasio, currently director of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California.

Will 2006 be the year of the mashup? Originally used to describe the mixing together of musical tracks, the term now refers to websites that weave data from different sources into a new service. They are becoming increasingly popular, especially for plotting data on maps, covering anything from caf\u00e9s offering wireless Internet access to traffic conditions. And advocates say they could fundamentally change many areas of science \u2014 if researchers can be persuaded to share their data. Some disciplines already have software that allows data from different sources to be combined seamlessly. For example, a bioinformatician can get a gene sequence from the GenBank database, its homologues using the BLAST alignment service, and the resulting protein structures from the Swiss-Model site in one step. And an astronomer can automatically collate all available data for an object, taken by different telescopes at various wavelengths, into one place, rather than having to check each source individually. So far, only researchers with advanced programming skills, working in fields organized enough to have data online and tagged appropriately, have been able to do this. But simpler computer languages and tools are helping. Google's maps database, for example, allows users to integrate data into it using just ten lines of code ( http://www.google.com/apis/maps ). UniProt, the world's largest protein database, is developing its existing public interfaces to protein sequence data to encourage outside users to access and reuse its data.  The biodiversity community is one group working to develop such services. To demonstrate the principle, Roderic Page of the University of Glasgow, UK, built what he describes as a \u201ctoy\u201d \u2014 a mashup called Ispecies.org ( http://darwin.zoology.gla.ac.uk/~rpage/ispecies ). If you type in a species name it builds a web page for it showing sequence data from GenBank, literature from Google Scholar and photos from a Yahoo image search. If you could pool data from every museum or lab in the world, \u201cyou could do amazing things\u201d, says Page. Donat Agosti of the Natural History Museum in Bern, Switzerland, is working on this. He is one of the driving forces behind AntBase and AntWeb, which bring together data on some 12,000 ant species. He hopes that, as well as searching, people will reuse the data to create phylogenetic trees or models of geographic distribution. This would provide the means for a real-time, worldwide collaboration of systematicists, says Norman Johnson, an entomologist at Ohio State University in Columbus. \u201cIt has the potential to fundamentally change and improve the way that basic systematic research is conducted.\u201d A major limiting factor is the availability of data in formats that computers can manipulate. To develop AntWeb further, Agosti aims to convert 4,000 papers into machine-readable online descriptions. Another problem is the reluctance of many labs and agencies to share data. But this is changing. A spokesman for the Global Health Atlas from the World Health Organization (WHO), for example, a huge infectious-disease database, says there are plans to make access easier. The Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) has linked up more than 80 million records in nearly 600 databases in 31 countries. And last month saw the launch of the International Neuroinformatics Coordinating Facility. But such initiatives are hampered by restrictive data-access agreements. The museums and labs that provide the GBIF with data, for example, often require outside researchers to sign online agreements to download individual data sets, making real-time computing of data from multiple sources almost impossible. Nature  has created its own mashup, which integrates data on avian-flu outbreaks from the WHO and the UN Food and Agriculture Organization into Google Earth ( http://earth.google.com/ ) (you will need to download  Google Earth  before opening the  mashup  file). The result is a useful snapshot, but illustrates the problem. As the data are not in public databases that can be directly accessed by software, we had to request them from the relevant agencies, construct a database and compute them into Google Earth. If the data were available in a machine-readable format, the mashup could search the databases automatically and update the maps as outbreaks occur. Other researchers could also mix the data with their own data sets. Page and Agosti hope that researchers will soon become more enthusiastic about sharing. \u201cOnce scientists see the value of freeing-up data, mashups will explode,\u201d says Page.\u00a0 \n               UPDATE: \n             Nature  mashup: mapping  avian flu  around the globe To demonstrate the potential of \"mashups\", which weave together data from different sources,  Nature  has created this simple example \u2013 a global visualization of avian flu cases and outbreaks. To our knowledge, this is the only source where all of this information has been brought together. We used  Google Earth  to map over time each of the 1800 or so outbreaks of avian flu in birds that have been reported over the past two years. The service also shows all confirmed human cases of infection with the H5N1 influenza virus in the same period. The animal data was compiled from information held by the FAO, the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) and various government sources, and was generously provided to Nature by the UN Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) Emergency Prevention System (EMPRES) for Transboundary Animal and Plant Pests and Diseases.  Nature  compiled the data on human cases from World Health Organization bulletins.  Mapping the FAO data posed several challenges. The biggest was that the original datasets contained no latitude and longitude data for the outbreaks, so it was impossible to map them directly. FAO uses a UN system for defining geographical units such as place names, provinces and districts that can only shared internally within UN agencies, and so it was not available. Latitude and longitude data therefore had to be calculated for every outbreak location. The data was structured into two databases, one for animal data and one for health data, and then converted to 'kml', an XML-based computer language that Google Earth uses as a standard for data exchange.  The Google Earth programme is then able to plot the cases and outbreaks by location and time, with links to relevant Web resources from FAO, WHO, and other organizations. The map is a 'beta', and although the data has been manually checked, errors in the positions of some locations cannot be excluded. The underlying animal data itself also suffers from underreporting of outbreaks, and omissions or inaccuracies in reporting. The FAO also notes with respect to its own data, \"facts and figures are to the best of our knowledge accurate and up to date\" and that \"FAO assumes no responsibility for any error or omission in the datasets\".

The disastrous state of China's drinking water has fallen under the spotlight after recent chemical spills and a government assessment of its cleanliness. According to a 30 December report from Xinhua, China's state news source, 300 million rural residents are drinking water polluted with high levels of fluorine, arsenic, snail fever (a parasitic liver disease), or other toxins 1 . That's one-third of China's total rural population. The news, which was posted on the Ministry of Water Resources website, follows hot on the heels of two disasters late last year. In those events, huge amounts of contaminants were poured into two rivers, cutting off millions of people from safe drinking water. On 13 November, 100 tonnes of benzene, which can cause cancer, poured into the Songhua River following a blast at a chemical plant in the northeastern city of Jilin (see ' Chinese cities face toxic spills '). A month later, a state-owned smelting plant in Shaoguan City dumped a huge quantity of cadmium into a river that provides drinking water for residents of southern Guangdong province.  \n              Safety restored \n            Officials say in both cases that the disasters are under control and access to drinking water has been restored. Reports say a combination of dams and carbon filtering have ensured that future supplies of drinking water in northern China are within safety standards. In Guangdong, provincial officials poured hundreds of tonnes of aluminium polymers into upstream waters, hoping make the cadmium settle out of the water. But foreign experts have not been able to sample the water, making them sceptical of safety claims. Concerning the benzene, which has now flowed past Harbin and the Russian city of Khabarovsk, one China-based foreign official close to the situation told  news@nature.com : \"We don't know what chemicals are there, whether they're seeping into the soil, or how much is left behind.\" The official asked not to be identified.  With the Songhua River freezing, there is concern that benzene will be trapped in ice and released again in the spring, he says. \"The problem won't go away.\" And the water was not clean to begin with, points out  news@nature.com 's source. The statement on China's water ministry website adds that the groundwater in half of China's cities is polluted. According to the vice-minister of water resources, E Jingping, China plans to increase its annual water supply capacity by 40 billion cubic metres by 2010, although he does not go into details about how this will be done.

By re-enacting an evolutionary event that happened to wheat thousands of years ago, researchers are producing new plant varieties that could save lives in regions where drought causes food shortages. Bread wheat ( Triticum aestivum ), a staple food for millions of people around the world, is the product of two rare genetic events that happened during the Stone Age in a region of the Middle East known as the 'fertile crescent'. Two different species can't usually breed to produce hybrid offspring, because their chromosomes don't match and can't pair properly during the process that produces sex cells such as eggs and sperm. But sometimes a genetic blip can produce sex cells with double the normal number of chromosomes, side-stepping the problem. If two sex cells of this type combine, a whole new fertile species with double the number of chromosomes is produced.  \n              Doubling up \n           This rare 'duplication followed by fertilization' event has happened twice in the history of modern, common wheat. Around 30,000 years ago, a wild wheat ( Triticum monococcum ) hybridized with a species of goat grass ( Aegilops speltoides ) to generate primitive wheat called emmer, which had four sets of chromosomes. Then about 9,000 years ago, emmer wheat grown south of the Caspian Sea crossed with another wild goat grass ( Aegilops tauschii ) to produce a plant with six sets of chromosomes. This hybrid had larger seeds than its ancestors, thanks to the bonus chromosomes, and so became a popular breed for early farmers. The descendents of these plants now cover more farmland globally than any other crop, filling more than 500 million acres worldwide. But this genetic triumph came with a downside: the wheat was so popular that no one farmed anything else, leading to a very low genetic diversity and limiting the options for plant breeders hoping to develop varieties resistant to drought or pests. To counter this, researchers at the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT) in Mexico have developed a way to top up bread wheat's shallow gene pool.  \n              Something old, something new \n            \"We've been re-enacting in the lab what took place in nature nine thousand years ago,\" says Richard Trethowan, a specialist in wheat breeding at CIMMYT. Researchers collected wild goat grass from the Middle East and crossed it with modern versions of emmer wheat to create bread wheat all over again. They used chemicals in the lab to induce the rare chromosome doubling that makes hybrids fertile. The technique helps to introduce new genes in the same way as genetic engineering, but without requiring the researchers to know which genes they are on the lookout for beforehand. The new bread wheats are not themselves suitable for farming, since most of the new hybrids have qualities that are more advantageous to grasses than to wheat. \"They?re ugly things,\" says Trethowan. But he adds that it is easy to use traditional breeding methods to get the few useful genes into common bread wheat strains.  \n              Food for thought \n            The genetic input has allowed improvements to wheat's drought resistance, for example. One wheat strain developed by the team produces between 20 and 40% more grain under dry conditions than traditional bread wheat, the researchers told an international symposium of plant breeders in December. CIMMYT has sent seeds produced by the research out to centres worldwide for local testing and development, and initial results have been promising. Farmers in Ecuador are racing to switch to one test strain that significantly outperforms the established local wheat, Trethowan says. He predicts that in five or six years time the new genes found by reinventing wheat will be dramatically improving yields everywhere. \"We're on the brink of quite a big genetic revolution for wheat breeding,\" says Trethowan. John Snape, a cereal geneticist at the John Innes Centre, Norwich, UK, adds that rich countries will probably benefit from this revolution too. \"It is likely that climates in Europe will get hotter and drier thanks to climate change, and this will put new stresses on crops,\" he says. One fungal wheat disease, Fusarium head blight, has already started to plague European fields thanks to warmer, more humid summers, he points out. \"Being able to reach out into wild species for new genes to tackle these problems is very valuable,\" he says.

Major League baseball has the next greatest number of unexpected results, the researchers say. American football is the most predictable of the sports they studied.

They find that, since records began - before 1890, in the case of English football - the chances of an upset have been consistently greater in English soccer than any of the American sports. The underdog wins 45% of the time in soccer, but just 36% of the time in American football. Distressingly for soccer fans, however, league games in England have become steadily more predictable since the 1940s.

The circulation of the deep oceans reversed abruptly some 55 million years ago, according to a study of fossilized sea creatures. This rings alarm bells about today's climate change, because the reversal coincided with a period of global warming driven by greenhouse gases. Deep ocean currents are intimately linked to our climate, and are driven by colder, saltier water at the poles plummeting to the bottom of the ocean. Recent studies have suggested that the circulation of the North Atlantic could be weakened by the influx of fresh water from melting polar ice. As this watery conveyor belt also brings warm water northwards from the tropics, some scientists fear that a major shift in the circulation could plunge western Europe into a deep freeze. Although computer models can predict how ocean circulation reacts to global warming, many researchers prefer to look for similar situations in the past to see how Earth responded. One useful period to look at is the Palaeocene/Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM) about 55 million years ago, when the average temperature of the oceans shot up by 7 or 8 \u00b0C. Flavia Nunes and Richard Norris, oceanographers at the University of California, San Diego, have now worked out how ocean currents changed during the PETM, they report in  Nature 1 . They have read the chemical records held in the shells of tiny fossilized deep-sea creatures called foraminifera.  \n              Carbon capture \n           Using samples from the Integrated Ocean Drilling Program, Norris and Nunes studied the relative amounts of two isotopes of carbon in the shells. This acts as a snapshot of the carbon isotope ratios in the deep water that surrounded the creatures. Scientists already knew that as a water mass travels along the deep section of the ocean's conveyor belt, it becomes enriched in carbon-12 compared with carbon-13. This is because it has more time to accumulate organic matter falling from dead creatures in surface waters, and these creatures tend to use more carbon-12 than carbon-13 in building their tissue. Comparing the composition of foraminifera shells at different locations throughout the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, the scientists found that a gradient in the ratio of carbon isotopes revealed which way the oceans' conveyor belts were turning during the PETM. They found that although the Atlantic's deep-water flow normally travels from south to north, it ran in the opposite direction during the period of global warming. Similar flips were seen in other oceans around the world. Perhaps most remarkable is how abrupt the changes were. \"The switch in circulation took just a few thousand years,\" says Norris. \"But then it took 100,000 years to revert.\" \"So if the ocean flips on us we may be living with that change for a long, long time,\" he adds. \"It's sort of frightening.\" Measurements have recently shown that the Atlantic current is lessening (see ' Atlantic currents show signs of weakening '), but researchers are divided about whether modern climate change will be enough to force the current to stop or flip.  \n              Old waters run deep \n            The research confirms computer models of 55-million-year-old ocean currents made by Karen Bice, an oceanographer at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, Massachusetts and her colleagues 2 .  Although scientists have found evidence of similar links between ocean current and climate in the last 200,000 years, Bice says that the PETM is a much better analogue for the climate change we see today, because it occurred in a world that was warming gradually in response to rising greenhouse gas levels. Norris says that they do not know the specific trigger for the circulation flip. But it seems likely that a warming world saw more evaporation from tropical seas, leading to greater rainfall at higher latitudes, explains Bice. This in turn pours fresh water into the northern oceans, weakening their currents. \"It's a good indicator of what could happen in our own future,\" warns Bice.

Washington DC A high-profile trial centred on the teaching of evolution is over. High-school students in Dover, Pennsylvania, will not now hear an announcement promoting intelligent design \u2014 the idea that an intelligent creator shaped today's organisms \u2014 before taking lessons on evolution. On 20 December, federal judge John Jones struck down a local school-board decision in a scathing 139-page rebuke to the intelligent-design movement. But other challenges to evolution are simmering across the country \u2014 and the Dover decision could influence their outcome, some say. Such fights usually originate at the state level \u2014 in the form of legislation or the setting of state-wide education standards \u2014 or at the school-district level, where local standards and curricula are generally set. A recent study from the Washington-based Thomas B. Fordham Institute into science curriculum standards gave failing grades to 15 states (see map). Alabama students, for instance, learn from biology textbooks adorned with a sticker describing evolution as \u201ccontroversial\u201d. But in Ohio, which passed, some students are taught from a state-approved lesson plan called \u201ccritical analysis of evolution\u201d, in which they research and present pro- and anti-evolution viewpoints. Robin Hovis, a member of the Ohio state board of education, says the Dover case may affect the future of the lesson plan. \u201cIt certainly gave those of us on the board who objected renewed hope,\u201d he adds. In Cobb County, Georgia, an appeals court is set to rule on a lower-court judgement deeming similar stickers unconstitutional. And in Kansas, a school-board primary election next August could reshape the state's educational landscape. Board members who edited the education standards to include \u201cscientific criticisms\u201d of evolution face challenges by moderate Republicans who want such language weeded out (see  Nature   438 , 267; 2005). In another twist, a group of Christian schools is suing the University of California for refusing to recognize certain high-school courses, including biology classes that use textbooks taking an anti-evolution view. The university has filed for dismissal, and expects to hear from the judge in a few months. \u201cThe Dover verdict says schools can't teach these non-scientific ideas as science, so that supports us,\u201d says Christopher Patti, a lawyer with the university. Legislation promoting intelligent design or similar anti-evolution ideas was introduced in more than a dozen states in 2005. Most died a hasty death, according to Nick Matzke, spokesman for the National Center for Science Education, a California-based non-profit organization that fights for evolution education. He and others hope that the Dover decision will help quash the promotion of intelligent design, which they say is a legal strategy for introducing religion into the classroom. \u201cCourt decisions never resolve social issues, and it won't here,\u201d says Matzke. \u201cBut it will give us a little breathing space. Intelligent design as a strategy is probably toast.\u201d Naturally, proponents of the theory disagree. Casey Luskin, a lawyer at the Discovery Institute, an intelligent-design think-tank in Seattle, Washington, says the Dover decision will have a \u201cnegligible effect\u201d. \u201cYou cannot change the facts of biology through a judicial ruling,\u201d he argues. \n                     School board in court over bid to teach intelligent design \n                   \n                     Intelligent design: Who has designs on your students' minds? \n                   \n                     Religion and Science in focus \n                   \n                     The Discovery Institute \n                   \n                     National Center for Science Education \n                   \n                     Judge Jones' opinion (pdf) \n                   \n                     Ohio-approved lesson plan on \u201cCritical Analysis of Evolution\u201d \n                   \n                     Kansas science education standards (grades 8\u201312; see p 75\u201378) \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

In an attempt to save the endangered sturgeon, international restrictions have been slapped on the export of caviar from key Eurasian fisheries thought not to be keeping a tight enough rein on illegal activities. The move has been cautiously welcomed by environmentalists, who say that even stronger steps are needed to prevent the extinction of sturgeon, many of which are harvested illegally to secure the high-priced fish eggs. \"This is a good move. It is an indication of how grim the situation is for these fish,\" says Rick Smith, a mammalogist who is executive director of Environmental Defence Canada in Toronto. He adds that he is surprised by the move. \"Frankly, CITES in the past has not characteristically taken such strong action.\"  \n              Fishy trading \n            Trade in caviar from wild sturgeon was effectively blocked on 3 January when a decision on export quotas was shelved by the secretariat of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). The Geneva-based organization seeks to limit trade in threatened species among its 169 member nations. CITES says there are continued reports of widespread illegal sturgeon fishing and caviar exports in the areas concerned. Not knowing how many fish are really being caught makes it impossible to come up with sensible, sustainable quotas, they say. Quotas were put on hold for fisheries in the Caspian Sea, the Black Sea where it meets the lower Danube River, and the Amur River on the Sino-Russian border. These produce most of the desired caviar, such as the eggs from beluga sturgeon ( Huso huso ). Nations bordering these waterways are required under the CITES convention to base export quotas on scientific studies. They are also meant to enforce regional conservation strategies to ensure export quotas are not exceeded. \"Governments need to fully implement the measures they have agreed to, to ensure that the exploitation of sturgeon stocks is commercially sustainable over the long term,\" says CITES secretary general Willem Wijnstekers in a statement. CITES has said it will reconsider quotas if and when this is done.  \n              Farmed eggs \n            The halt on quotas won't mean a complete lack of caviar on store shelves however, because much of previous years' crops are still unsold, and a small amount of caviar produced from farmed sturgeon can still be traded. But the wild quotas are much larger than the farmed amounts. In 2002, annual export quotas ranged from nearly 76,000 kilograms from Iran to 23,500 kg from Kazakhstan.  Last month, WWF and TRAFFIC, a Cambridge-based network that monitors wildlife trade, jointly issued a report showing that European authorities had seized 12,000 kg of illegal caviar between 2000 and 2005. CITES officials noted that key European countries have failed to implement policies to ensure imports only of legal caviar. Officials at Caviar Emptor, a Washington-based consortium of environmental groups fighting to halt wild caviar trade, say CITES' stance is encouraging. \"We want this to be long term,\" says Shannon Crownover, spokeswoman for the consortium. In past years, CITES has instituted a number of temporary measures to better control the caviar trade. But this is the first time that such a firm move has been made before the spring harvest, says Crownover, which is the biggest harvest of the year. \n                   CITES \n                 \n                   Caviar Emptor \n                 \n                   Endangered fish alliance \n                 Reprints and Permissions"},

There is no evidence that cloning researcher Woo Suk Hwang created any lines of patient-specific stem cells. The verdict, reached by investigators at Seoul National University (SNU) after claims that Hwang faked his work, confirms stem-cell researchers' worst fears. In a celebrated paper published last May, the South Korean researcher reported cloning cell lines from 11 different patients, which could in principle have been used for therapy (W. S. Hwang  et al .  Science   308,  1777\u20131783; 2005). But after several allegations of fraud, a university committee asked three different laboratories to compare the DNA of Hwang's purportedly cloned cell lines with that of the patients who had provided the cells. On 23 December, the committee reported that the data from the  Science  paper came from just two cell lines, not eleven as claimed. And on 29 December, it demolished hopes that those two lines would be patient-specific: they turned out to match stem-cell lines from embryos produced by  in vitro  fertilization at MizMedi Hospital in Seoul. MizMedi provided egg cells for Hwang's research. \u201cThe committee concludes that there are neither patient-specific stem-cell lines in Hwang's laboratory nor any scientific evidences to support the claim that such cell lines ever existed,\u201d said Jung Hye Roe, director of research at the SNU. According to the Korean press, Hwang has accused a co-author at MizMedi of switching the cell lines. But he submitted his resignation to the SNU on 23 December, and he and several co-authors have asked for the  Science  paper to be retracted. On 10 January, the SNU plans to report on two other papers by Hwang's team \u2014 a  Science  paper in which the team claimed to be the first to produce stem cells from a cloned human embryo (W. S. Hwang  et al .  Science   303,  1669\u20131674; 2004), and a  Nature  paper that reported the first cloned dog (B. C. Lee  et al .  Nature   436 , 641; 2005). Both journals are running investigations. And a South Korean bioethics committee will meet on 15 January to look into the charges and other issues concerning egg donation in Hwang's lab. For example, Hwang claimed that he used only 242 eggs for the 2004 paper and 185 for the paper on patient-specific cells. But reports have emerged that say Hwang used more than 1,600 eggs in the experiments. Sung Il Roh, a MizMedi fertility expert and second author on the 2005  Science  paper, told  Nature  that he alone provided 313 mature eggs, from 21 donors, for the 2004 paper and 900 eggs, from 62 donors, for the 2005 paper. As  Nature  went to press,  PD Notebook , a Korean investigative news programme, was about to air a piece that levels further charges against Hwang. According to one of its producers, the programme will claim that Hwang coerced a junior team member into donating eggs for research. Nature previously reported that this researcher felt obliged to donate eggs after accidentally destroying some early in the experiment. Hwang has not so far responded to  Nature 's requests for an interview. Hwang might even find himself facing legal action. According to  The Korea Times , government prosecutors could decide to pursue fraud charges after the SNU investigation is complete. Hwang's group received more than 3 billion won (US$3 million) for research from the ministry of science and technology last year, and 24 billion won for new facilities. \n                     Korean sleuths bring bad news for Hwang \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

After some 30 years of research, scientists have finally shown in clinical trials that vaccines can safely combat rotavirus, the leading cause of death from severe diarrhoea and dehydration in children.  One of the vaccines to pass muster in these trials has already been licensed for use in a few countries on the back of other, smaller tests. But experts say the unqualified success of two drugs in these larger trials, without negative side effects, is a major step towards getting them put into wider use.  This could have a huge impact on children's health. In developing countries, where dehydration can be tough to treat, it kills some half a million children each year. In the United States, rotavirus causes about 55,000 hospital admissions annually, and a few dozen deaths.  The two different vaccines in the trials were shown to drastically reduce the occurence of severe symptoms, by between 85 and 100%. The results are reported in the  New England Journal of Medicine 1 , 2 . Researchers hope that the vaccines, which are swallowed rather than injected, will become a routine part of the immunization repertoire given to babies alongside diphtheria and tetanus. \"These results are really promising and very exciting,\" says Umesh Parashar, an infectious-disease specialist at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, Georgia. But the researchers caution that several obstacles remain before the therapies can start saving large numbers of lives in the developing world.  \n              Trial and error \n            Scientists have been seeking a vaccine against rotavirus since the discovery of the pathogen in 1973. The virus, which has many different strains, infects almost every child in the world before they reach five years of age, although often with only mild effects. There is no drug treatment yet.  Investigators had some success with a vaccine called RotaShield in the late 1990s, but it was withdrawn after only nine months because it was found to trigger a rare but potentially fatal intestinal blockage in a handful of children. Though the vaccine would have undoubtedly saved many lives in the developing world, it proved untenable to offer a vaccine overseas that had been deemed too risky for the United States. Researchers could not work out why the monkey rotavirus in the vaccine caused this problem, and feared that all rotavirus vaccines might be similarly scuttled. To prove that the new vaccines are safe, the teams enrolled more than 60,000 infants for each trial, in order to detect complications that might develop in only a few tens or hundreds. Both vaccines appeared to avoid side effects and protected children against multiple strains of rotavirus. One, called Rotarix and manufactured by drug giant GlaxoSmithKline, contains a crippled strain of live human rotavirus 1 . The other, a Merck vaccine dubbed RotaTeq, is made up of five different disabled rotaviruses, each a combination of strains from humans and cows 2 .  Merck's RotaTeq could be available in US paediatric clinics later this year. An expert committee last month advised the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to approve the vaccine for use, thanks in part to the trial data.  \n              Roadblocks \n            But experts in the field say they face several challenges before the rotavirus vaccine can be widely used. In the United States and other developed countries, Parashar suggests that a reputation for side effects may prevent doctors and parents from adopting the vaccines. \"The concerns about safety will remain for a while,\" he says. Researchers add that they must perform additional clinical trials to test whether the immunizations are as effective on children that are malnourished and harbour other infections, as is often the case in developing countries. The vaccine may also prove too expensive for widespread use in such places.  Non-profit groups including the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunizations are pushing to make the vaccines available in the developing world, and are supporting local trials of these vaccines along with the pharmaceutical companies. Paediatrician David Matson of Eastern Virginia Medical School in Norfolk, Virginia, lead researcher in the RotaTeq trial, adds that there is concern that the vaccine could become less effective over time. Like the influenza virus, rotavirus can swap genes to produce strains that might evade the immune response provoked by the vaccine. This means that the vaccine might have to be regularly tweaked to target the most common circulating strains. \n                   The Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization \n                 \n                   Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation \n                 \n                   CDC Rotavirus \n                 \n                   WHO Rotavirus \n                 Reprints and Permissions"},

A no-fishing zone in the Caribbean appears to be helping both the big fish it was designed to save and, surprisingly, the coral that underlies the ecosystem. That's despite the fact that the large fish chow down on smaller fish that help out the coral. The study highlights how difficult it can be to predict how an ecosystem responds to changes, the researchers say. But it also reconfirms that protecting biodiversity is a good defense against destructive changes, they add. The Caribbean coral reefs in question were dealt a blow in the mid 1980s when a mysterious disease almost completely wiped out the spiny urchin ( Diadema antillarum ). One way these urchins influenced the ecosystem was by grazing down the large alage that grows in the area, making a clear area where juvenile coral could gain an easy foothold. With the urchins gone, it was up to another grazer, the colourful parrotfish, to keep the algae under control.  Parrotfish are hunted and eaten by the predatory Nassau grouper ( Epinephelus striatus ), another fish in the region. Groupers are often kept in check by fishermen. But some regions in the Caribbean, such as the Exuma Cays Land and Sea Park, are protected from fishing. So Peter Mumby of the University of Exeter worried about how the corals would fare with a mass of groupers around to gobble up all the parrotfish. Perhaps, they feared, the corals would simply be smothered under a blanket of algae.  \n              Fish eat fish world \n            After five years of diving trips, wherebye Mumby and his international team scuba-dived transect after transect of Caribbean ocean, the group is pleased to report in this week's Science that the corals are faring well 1 .  Although some small species of parrotfish do get nibbled on a bit more, they found, the large species-just too big to comfortably fit into the mouths of the grouper-have also benefited from the absence of fishermen. These larger parrotfish are fantastic grazers, making the algae cover fourfold less inside the park than outside the reserve.   \"It is good to know that the use of reserves to manage fish and corals is compatible,\" says Mumby. But he adds that there could be more complicated interactions elsewhere, and that the corals may need additional help. \"I don't feel that marine reserves are the only tool necessary to manage reefs,\" he says. Robert Carpenter, a marine biologist at California State University, Northridge, California, says the result is good news. In his own work, he has documented the gradual re-emergence of the urchin and its positive benefit for corals. Carpenter says he looks forward to the day when both urchins and parrotfish share the task of clearing way for baby coral. \"The benefit of biodiversity is that it gives us redundant players in the system, which can then provide resilience in the face of disturbance,\" he says.

To demonstrate the potential of 'mashups', which weave together data from different sources (see ' Mashups mix data into global service ' ),  Nature  has created a simple example - a global visualization of avian flu cases and outbreaks. To our knowledge, this is the only source where all of this information has been brought together. The mashup was first built in December 2005, and will be updated periodically (Download the mashup by  clicking here  . You will need Google Earth, which you can  download here ) We used  Google Earth  to map over time each of the 1,800 or so outbreaks of avian flu in birds that have been reported over the past two years. The service also shows all confirmed human cases of infection with the H5N1 influenza virus in the same period. The animal data was compiled from information held by the FAO, the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) and various government sources, and was generously provided to  Nature  by the UN Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) Emergency Prevention System (EMPRES) for Transboundary Animal and Plant Pests and Diseases.  Nature  compiled the data on human cases from World Health Organization bulletins.  Mapping the FAO data posed several challenges. The biggest was that the original datasets contained no latitude and longitude data for the outbreaks, so it was impossible to map them directly. FAO uses a UN system for defining geographical units such as place names, provinces and districts that can only shared internally within UN agencies, and so it was not available. Latitude and longitude data therefore had to be calculated for every outbreak location.  The data was structured into two databases, one for animal data and one for health data, and then converted to 'kml', an XML-based computer language that Google Earth uses as a standard for data exchange.  The Google Earth programme is then able to plot the cases and outbreaks by location and time, with links to relevant Web resources from FAO, WHO, and other organizations.   The map is a 'beta', and although the data has been manually checked, errors in the positions of some locations cannot be excluded. The underlying animal data itself also suffers from underreporting of outbreaks, and omissions or inaccuracies in reporting. The FAO also notes with respect to its own data, \"facts and figures are to the best of our knowledge accurate and up to date\" and that \"FAO assumes no responsibility for any error or omission in the datasets\".

Common assumptions about the ecological benefits of 'salvage' logging following forest fires are wrong, according to a study of the aftermath of a 2002 fire in Oregon. Culling any remaining timber after a forest fire is sometimes thought to be good for forests, because it removes dead trees that might spark future fires, and because it clears the ground for more seedlings to grow. But these ideas aren't backed up by the facts, says Dan Donato, a forest ecologist from Oregon State University, Corvallis. Donato and his colleagues studied the largest forest fire in Oregon's history: the Biscuit Fire (named after a mountain close to where the fire started). This fire raged for 120 days through the Siskiyou National Forest, which is largely composed of Douglas fir ( Pseudotsuga menziesii ), and destroyed roughly 200,000 hectares. After the fire, the US Forest Service proposed a programme of salvage logging. This conservation effort boosted the local economy, providing jobs in both forest and timber mills. Some of the money was then fed back into forest management. The scientists followed the progress of the logging both before and after it began in October 2004.  \n              Dead wood best left \n            The team found that when tree trunks were removed, this tended to scatter smaller chunks of debris around the forest. \"Basically, all the branches get left behind and actually increase the fire risk,\" says Donato. They also found that the unlogged sites saw excellent regeneration, with an average of 767 seedlings per hectare, greater than the regional standard for what is considered a 'fully stocked' forest. In contrast, logged areas saw a mere 224 seedlings per hectare. The researchers suggest that this is because dragging logs through the forest tends to disturb the soil and hinder regrowth. They conclude that the best way to reduce the fire risk of burnt-out forests is actually to leave dead trees standing for as long as possible, they report in  Science 1 . \"That's how forests have been recovering from fire for a very long time,\" says Donato. \"Natural recovery is possible,\" agrees Jim Goldin, a US Forest Service forester based in the Pacific Northwest. But he adds that a lot of forests are no longer in a 'natural state' in the first place, and so may not have the same ability to recover after a fire.  Many forests are managed to avoid small fires, for example, so they never thin out in the way they would do in the absence of mankind. When a fire does take hold it tends to be bigger and more destructive. \"The consequences are more severe, and recovery is more uncertain,\" says Goldin. He adds that it is important not to generalize these findings, because different tree species will have different forest ecologies.  \n              Salvaging profits \n            Although the scientists' conclusions may seem straightforward, salvage logging has become enormously controversial. Environmental campaigners have argued that the Biscuit Fire logging was simply an opportunity for logging companies to cultivate their profit margin. \"The trouble is that the debate's been going on based on assumptions, with no real data,\" says Donato.  Some of that debate has surrounded a piece of legislation currently working its way through Congress, which aims to clear red tape so that logging companies can gain access to burnt forest land as soon as possible. This would help them get to the wood before it rots. Donato says his study indicates it makes little difference to the ecology of a forest whether loggers go in months or years after a fire. He adds that economic and environmental factors should be balanced when dealing with the aftermath of a forest fire. \"I just hope that no matter which way the policy decisions go, this study will inform the debate,\" he says. \n                   Fire Science for Rainforests \n                 \n                   USDA Forest Service \n                 \n                   Biscuit Fire Pictures \n                 \n                   US General Accounting Office report on Biscuit Fire \n                 Reprints and Permissions"},

Two deaths from avian flu have been reported in Turkey. If confirmed, the cases would be the first outside Asia, where the H5N1 virus has already infected more than 140 people, killing 74 of them.  Confusion has reigned since the death of the first patient in Turkey, a 14-year old boy from Do\u01e7ubeyazit, a town in the east of the country on the border with Iran. On 2 January, the Turkish health ministry stated that the boy and his 15-year old sister, who died today, did not have avian flu. But on 4 January it reversed its position, stating that tests had identified the virus as H5N1 in both children, and in another sick member of the family. Samples have been sent to the World Health Organization for confirmatory testing. As many as a dozen other suspect cases are under surveillance. Albert Osterhaus, a virologist at the Erasmus Medical Centre in Rotterdam in the Netherlands, says that the occurrence of human cases on the frontiers of Europe highlights the need for rapid action to detect and eliminate outbreaks in animals. It also confirms the \"worrisome\" expectation that human cases of avian flu may occur wherever there are poultry outbreaks, he adds. Avian flu first arrived in Europe's birds last July, when avian outbreaks occurred in Russia. It has since appeared in Kazakhstan, Croatia, Romania and Turkey.  \n              In your own backyard \n            Farming conditions in Turkey, where backyard farms are common, are more similar to Asian countries than many European countries. Europe mostly has industrial poultry operations that can be cut off from everyday contact with people. But that doesn't mean countries should be complacent, Osterhaus says. Osterhaus was involved in controlling an outbreak of the H7N7 avian flu in the Netherlands in 2003, where 30 million chickens in industrial operations were culled. The outbreak affected relatively large numbers of people, he points out: 88 farm workers and family members were infected, and one veterinarian died. Although industrial farming involves less contact between people and poultry, outbreaks in high-density farms can create ideal conditions for amplification of the virus, notes Osterhaus.  The lesson learned in the Netherlands, he says, was that immediate control measures, with tough enforcement, are needed as soon as an outbreak is detected. But Turkey, Russia, and Croatia, have yet to stop the spread of poultry outbreaks, so the risk of more human infections is very real, says Osterhaus. However, he adds that the new cases in Europe \"do not fundamentally increase the pandemic potential of the virus\", compared with the situation in Asia. \"With 142 cases in Asia, a couple of new ones on the doorstep of Europe doesn't change much,\" he says. \n                   Bird flu in focus \n                 \n                   Avian influenza web focus \n                 \n                   WHO \n                 Reprints and Permissions"},

A murderer could leave a telltale genetic fingerprint in their victim's genes, say researchers in Japan, helping forensic sleuths to identify how they were killed.  Experts often struggle to diagnose whether someone died by strangulation or suffocation, rather than by some other means. In some cases, the crime scene or marks on the body make the case clear cut; in others there are no such clues. Now a team at Nagasaki University has shown that a person's own genes might help to reveal how they met their end. Kazuya Ikematsu and his colleagues anaesthetized and then killed two small groups of mice, by either strangulation with a string, or by decapitation. They dissected skin samples from the animals' necks and compared the activity of a broad spectrum of genes inside the skin cells, by looking at the amount of RNA pumped out by those genes. The researchers found four genes that were more active in the strangled animals than those that had died suddenly. Their findings are accepted for publication in the journal  Legal Medicine 1 . The study adds to emerging evidence that gene activity could be a useful clue in pinpointing the time or cause of death. It's a direction that could prove very useful in forensics, says pathologist and molecular biologist Edward Gabrielson of Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland. \"The concept of using molecular markers in forensic pathology is interesting and potentially very powerful,\" he says.  \n              Under pressure \n            Future studies could identify a battery of genes or proteins whose levels of activity are consistently boosted or cut when the skin is under pressure or deprived of oxygen, Gabrielson suggests. In human cases, pathologists could screen tissue for this molecular signature and use it, alongside more traditional techniques, to help pin down the cause of death. Such a technique would be particularly valuable in cases of sudden infant death syndrome, says Greg G. Davis, a medical examiner and forensic pathologist at the University of Alabama, Birmingham. It could help to reveal whether a child suffocated on their bedding or died for other reasons. \"That alone would be extraordinarily useful,\" he says.  Presently, forensic pathologists rely largely on case histories, including the situation in which a body is found, plus gross examinations and scrutiny of the tissues. In the case of suffocation, examiners look for bruises, damage to delicate neck cartilage and tiny burst blood vessels in the eyes.  But because these signs can be subtle or missing entirely, some cases of suffocation and strangulation \"can be an extremely difficult or subtle diagnosis,\" Davis says. \"People have been searching for a magic test for asphyxiation for decades.\"  \n              Body of evidence \n            Davis and Gabrielson caution that far more extensive studies must be done before molecular methods can be routinely used on human bodies.  One obstacle is that they must deal with the natural variations in gene activity between each person and those caused by genetic or protein material decaying since the time of death. \"I don't see anyone being put in jail based just on this,\" Davis says. And medical examiners may be reluctant to adopt new techniques if they think old ones will suffice. \"It takes effort to start moving a field in new directions,\" Gabrielson adds. \n                   Legal medicine \n                 Reprints and Permissions"},

Thanks to political tensions easing in Lebanon, archaeologists have finally managed to locate the sites of ancient Phoenician harbours in the seaports that dominated Mediterranean trade thousands of years ago.  By drilling out cores of sediment from the modern urban centres of these cities, geologists have mapped out the former coastlines that the sediments have long since buried. From this they have pinpointed the likely sites of the old harbours, and have marked out locations that, they say, are in dire need of exploration and conservation. The modern cities of Tyre and Sidon on the Lebanese coast were once the major launching points of the seafaring Phoenicians. They were to the ancient world what Venice, Shanghai, Liverpool and New York have been in later times: some of the greatest of the world's ports, and crucial conduits for trade and cultural exchange. From the harbours of the Phoenician cities, ships carried precious dyes and textiles, soda and glass throughout the Mediterranean and beyond. Both cities still carry the same name, but the coastlines on which they sit have been reshaped by silting since the time of the Phoenicians, about 3,000 years ago. Sidon has extended out to sea through the build-up of silt. And Tyre, which was once an island, has been joined up to the mainland by silting, while much of the old land has sunk beneath the waves.  But whereas these major geographical changes were roughly known, no one knew the exact shape of the old coastline, which would in turn reveal the positions of the ancient harbours themselves.  \n              Digging in \n            Nick Marriner of the European Centre for Research and Teaching on the Geosciences of the Environment (CEREGE) in Aix-en-Provence, France, and his colleagues set out to drill beneath the modern city centres to determine how the coastlines have changed over time 1 - 3 .  Marriner explains that the political situation in Lebanon, with a civil war that only ended in 1990, has hindered attempts to explore its ancient history. Much of what is known about the Phoenician cities comes from indirect or old sources. \"At Tyre, there are presently no large-scale excavation sites, and much of our knowledge derives from work undertaken during the nineteenth century through to the early 1970s,\" Marriner says. Some of that early archaeological work has been challenged on further scrutiny. In the 1930s, for example, the French archaeologist and pioneer of aerial photography Antoine Poidebard claimed to have found the location of the southern harbour of ancient Tyre, which is now submerged. But recent work suggests that he instead found an urban part of the old city, rather than a port4. To get a clearer picture, Marriner and his colleagues drilled a total of 40 cores throughout the two cities, and used radiocarbon dating of seeds, wood, charcoal and marine mollusc shells to determine the age of each layer.  The results shed some light on what is known of the cities. Both of the Lebanese sites were occupied since at least the Bronze Age (around 3,000 years BC). Tyre was conquered in 332 years BC by Alexander the Great. And both sites were later occupied by the Romans, then the Arabs and the Mameluke Turks.  Marriner's examination of the soil shows that the rate of coastal silting shot up tenfold during the Roman occupation. Their geological records show that the Romans and subsequently the Byzantines must have been forced to dredge the harbours to keep them workable. Trade during this period is known to have declined sharply.  \n              Save and protect \n            Most importantly, the work indicates where the old harbours lay: underneath today's urban centres. Marriner hopes that his findings will help efforts to protect the cultural heritage of the two cities, and says that the Directorate General of Antiquities of Lebanon is very interested in the results. \"They are rich historical and archaeological archives, and the real test is protecting them from the pressures of urban development,\" he says.  Both Tyre and Sidon are undergoing rapid, uncontrolled urban expansion. \"There are plans to develop areas of Tyre as a tourist resort,\" says Marriner. \"If this is not correctly regulated many important archaeological sites will be damaged or lost.\" CEREGE, Aix-en-Provence, France \n                   GSA Journals \n                 \n                   CEREGE \n                 \n                   International Association for the protection of Tyre (AIST) \n                 Reprints and Permissions"},

The mysterious disappearance of frog species throughout Central and South America has been linked to a fungal disease that is exacerbated by the changing climate. \"Disease is the bullet killing frogs, but climate change is pulling the trigger,\" says Alan Pounds, an ecologist at the Monteverde Cloud Forest Preserve and Tropical Science Center in Costa Rica. Researchers warn that the fungus  Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis , which lives on the frogs' skin, may be killing amphibians worldwide. Tropical America is just one of many regions that have seen dramatic losses of amphibian species over the past few decades. In 2004, the first global assessment of amphibians revealed that almost a third of the world's known species are threatened with extinction 1 .  Studies have pointed to a range of causes for these deaths, including infections, habitat loss and changing temperature or rain patterns; amphibians, with their moist, breathable skins, are thought to be particularly sensitive to environmental change. But the root of the problem in many places, often in seemingly pristine habitats, has remained elusive.  \n              First to go \n           Pounds and his team set out to test whether fungal disease exacerbated by climate change could explain the loss of 70 or so species of harlequin frog ( Atelopus ) from the highlands of Central and South America. Many of them have vanished despite being in protected reserves. The team first mapped the timing of species disappearances against changes in sea-surface and air temperature over the past few decades, and found that the frogs are disappearing almost exactly in step with climate change.  But it was not clear how the link between species loss and climate change worked: the world is generally warming, but the fungus is thought to be more deadly in cooler climes.  So the team looked at 50 sites from Costa Rica to Peru. It found that the frogs were doing worst in areas where night-time temperatures are getting warmer, but day-time temperatures are cooler - conditions that favour the fungus.  The most likely connection, say the researchers in  Nature 2 , is that large-scale warming is accelerating the formation of clouds. This in turn makes local conditions kinder on the fungus, and spells bad news for the frogs.  \n              Cause for alarm \n            The extent to which the team's finding explains the global problem of amphibian deaths is not yet clear. But Pounds argues that because the chytrid fungus is known to exist in many regions, including Europe and Australia, \"it is likely to be a key player on a global scale\". Of course, it is still uncertain how global climate change will affect local weather patterns where frogs and toads live. Camille Parmesan, an ecologist at the University of Texas, Austin, and an author of the third assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, applauds the study. She says it is \"the first to show a whole group of extreme-environment species disappearing because of climate change on a large scale\".  Pounds hopes his team's findings will ram home the global-warming message. \"We have to reduce concentrations of greenhouse gases very soon if we are to avoid massive losses of biodiversity.\" Monteverde Cloud Forest Preserve, Costa Rica. \n                   Global Amphibian Assessment \n                 Reprints and Permissions"},

Observers say that encouraging industry to get clean is a good idea. But critics add that not enough money is being pumped into the plan. And not having targets for reducing emissions, they say, is a bad idea. The first meeting of the Asia-Pacific Partnership on Clean Development and Climate, which comprises Australia, the United States, Japan, South Korea, India and China, was hosted in sunny Sydney this week. Together the countries came up with a scheme to address climate change that they say will be good for both the economy and the planet. Their plan focuses on the creation of eight government-business task forces, which will concentrate on cleaning up power generation and distribution, the building trade, and the industries of steel, aluminium, cement and coal mining. These task forces are to devise action plans, time frames and performance indicators, but details are vague at present. The plan does not specifically mention nuclear power. The aluminium industry was held up at the meeting as a poster child for the strategy.

Computers already use magnets to store their memories. Now scientists are trying to make their whole 'brain' go magnetic. Conventional computers do their 'thinking' by shuttling electrons through arrangements of transistors called logic gates. But in order for those thoughts to be stored as computer memories, the electrical signals have to be translated by bulky components into magnetic fields on the metallic grains that cover your hard drive. This additional step takes up extra room in a computer. What's more, transistors get so hot that it is becoming increasingly difficult to pack more of them on to silicon chips without melting something important. The solution? Space-saving, cool-headed, magnetic logic gates. Alexandra Imre and her colleagues from the University of Notre Dame, Indiana, have created such a logic gate from a pattern of tiny nickel-iron magnets, each about 100 nanometres long. Their magnetic fields can point in one of two directions, which represent the computer bits '1' or '0'. Because each nanomagnet influences the state of its neighbour, a range of input signals at one side of the pattern can trigger a predictable outcome at the other. At the moment, the team have only made isolated logic gates as a proof of principle. But linking them together could build much more complex computing devices that rely on a whole cascade of flipping fields. They unveil the system in this week's  Science 1 . If successful, such computers could have the added bonus of boosting security on things such as magnetic strips in credit cards. If these strips are capable of performing calculations rather than simply carrying a password, says Mark Welland, a nanotechnologist at the University of Cambridge, UK, this would make the card much harder to copy.  \n              Neither nor \n            Although Imre's invention is not the first magnetic logic gate 2 , it is certainly the most versatile, because it carries a switch that can completely change the gate's function. This could allow very different computations to be run on the same chip. Known as a MAJORITY gate, its electronic equivalent is already widely used. Such gates can behave as either NAND or NOR gate (the inverse of AND and OR functions) depending on how they are set. Any other logic system can be built from a handful of these gates.  The scientists calculate that their gates would use about 100 times less power than those built from transistors, thus reducing troublesome heating in the circuit. Unlike conventional electronics, each gate does not need to be powered separately.  They also suggest that their logic gate could potentially use magnetic memory bits directly as an input. At the moment, the input has to be laboriously constructed, by painstakingly arranging other magnetic particles with their north or south poles facing the gate. But other teams are currently tackling this hurdle, says Dan Allwood, a materials scientist at the University of Sheffield, UK.  The researchers at the University of Notre Dame are now trying to join up their gates, and find a way to interface them with a conventional electronic device.  \n              Stiff competition \n            So will your computer be going magnetic anytime soon? \"Whether or not this will compete with conventional microelectronics is hard to say,\" says Wolfgang Porod, part of the Notre Dame team.  Manufacturing of silicon chips has become so streamlined that any new advance not based on the same processing methods must offer serious advantages to make them cost effective.  But magnetic chips are making some ground already. Intel, the world's largest computer chip manufacturer, is looking at integrating some of the different approaches to magnetic computing in to its next generation of chips, says Allwood. \"Each [approach] has an application where it can beat electronics in some way,\" he says. \n                   Future Computing In Focus \n                 \n                   Science \n                 \n                   Beginner's Guide to Logic gates \n                 Reprints and Permissions"},

Contrary to all expectations, the mysterious dark energy that is pushing the Universe apart may be changing with time. By observing distant, powerful bursts of gamma rays (\u03b3-rays), Brad Schaefer says he has preliminary evidence that the strength of dark energy is different today from when the Universe was very young. Schaefer, an astronomer at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge, presented his results at an American Astronomical Society meeting in Washington DC. Just minutes after the data were presented in a late afternoon session, some astronomers were already calling the bold claim into question.  An idea that arose in the late 90s, dark energy seems to act over very large distances, pushing the Universe apart at an ever increasing speed. At the moment, many researchers believe that dark energy may be a foam of quantum particles that exists throughout the vacuum of space. Under that scenario, dark energy would be a constant and unchanging force, according to Michael Turner, a cosmologist from the University of Chicago, Illinois.  Schaefer's findings, if they are true, would turn that idea on its head.  \n              Big, bright bursts \n            Schaefer began by examining 52 bursts of high-energy \u03b3-rays that were recorded by six satellites. The bursts came from the explosions of distant, super-massive stars that were billions of light years away. The explosions were so distant that the ones we see now occurred when the Universe was only 1.5 billion years old, a tenth of its current age.  Schaefer used various properties of the bursts, such as the way their brightness changed over time, to work out how intrinsically bright they were and how far away the explosion was. Twelve of the most distant of the bursts examined by Schaefer turned out to be brighter than would be expected if dark energy had remained a constant.  \"I would not characterize this as proof,\" Schaefer cautions. \"Before we can be confident, we will have to see these results reproduced.\"  \n              The old ways \n            Many questions surround Schaefer's result, says Dieter Hartmann, a \u03b3-ray astronomer at Clemson University in South Carolina.  For one, says Hartmann, the findings are dependent on understanding just how the ancient, massive stars lived and died. \"The births of these stars will be different, and the environment in which they ultimately explode is different,\" he says. Without understanding the physics of these explosions, the estimate of their intrinsic brightness is very uncertain, he says. Others are still more sceptical. \"I think he's wrong,\" says Adam Riess, an astronomer at the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, Maryland. Riess says that Schaefer's failure to include nearby and recent \u03b3-ray bursts to calibrate the results make his conclusions about the much more distant bursts highly questionable. \"This is an intriguing result,\" admits Turner.

Researchers have sequenced the bird flu viruses that killed two people in Turkey in early January, and say that one of them contains a worrying mutation. This genetic tweak can make the H5N1 virus more adapted to humans than to birds, and more adapted to the nose and throat than to the lungs. This latter effect could help to increase the chances of bird flu being transmitted between people, researchers say.  They add that many more mutations would probably be necessary before the virus is capable of sparking a full-blown pandemic, in which disease spreads like wild fire from person to person. The samples of H5N1 virus, taken from the first two victims who died of bird flu in Turkey, were sequenced at a World Health Organisation (WHO) collaborating centre at the National Institute for Medical Research in London, UK. The results were announced on Thursday 12 January, along with confirmation of two new cases: bird flu has now also struck Sanliurfa Province, near Turkey's southern border with Syria, and Siirt Province, in the eastern part of Turkey.  The total number of reported human cases has now reached 18 in less than two weeks, three of which have been fatal.  \n              In a bind \n            The WHO has released details of only one of the mutations found in the viruses. This genetic change results in a substitution of the amino acid serine by another amino acid, asparagine, at a specific position in one of the virus's proteins; a protein that helps the flu virus to bind to receptors on host cells.  This mutation has been observed twice before: in a father and son in Hong Kong in February 2003, and in one fatal case in Vietnam last year. It is known to increase the affinity of the virus for human receptors over poultry ones.  Until samples from the remaining cases are sequenced over the coming week, it is unknown how many of these came from viruses with the same mutation. If many prove to have the same tweak, this may help to account for the relatively large size of Turkey's rapid outbreak. The WHO's current explanation for the spate of cases is simply that people are bringing chickens into their homes during the harsh Turkish winter.  \n              Nose and throat \n            The mutation also has a secondary effect, which may be more worrying.  There are two subtypes of receptors in the human respiratory tract: alpha 2.3, which occurs mainly in the lower respiratory tract; and alpha 2.6, which occurs mainly in the nose and throat. Human flu viruses typically show a preference for the 2.6 receptors, whereas H5N1 strains typically prefer 2.3. This is good news for those worried about bird flu, since human-to-human transmission is thought to be more likely via droplets coughed from the nose and throat than from infections lower down. But the mutation found in the Turkey viruses is also known to be able to increase the affinity for H5N1 to the 2.6 receptors, points out Sylvie van der Werf, head of the Laboratory of Molecular Genetics of Respiratory Viruses at the Pasteur Institute in Paris, France.  Van der Werf adds that this affinity will, however, be affected by other genetic changes in the virus, which at present are an unknown factor.  \n              Multiple mutations \n            Thankfully, one mutation alone is unlikely to lead to efficient human-to-human transmission. The genetic changes that would allow this to happen are poorly understood, but are thought to require an exact combination of changes in multiple genes.  \"Adaptation to humans is a polygenic trait. It requires mutations in each of the eight segments of the virus's genome. Every one has to be correctly optimized to ensure human-to-human transmission,\" explains Edward Holmes, who is studying virus evolution at Pennsylvania State University in Philadelphia. \"You are talking multiple mutations across the entire genome.\" That's an improbable, but not impossible event.  Researchers continue to examine the genome of bird flu viruses, and are taking measures to stop the spread of disease among birds and people in Turkey. \n                   Bird flu in focus \n                 \n                   WHO \n                 Reprints and Permissions"},

Like the look of our website? Whatever the answer (and hopefully it was yes), the chances are you made your mind up within the first twentieth of a second. A study by researchers in Canada has shown that the snap decisions Internet users make about the quality of a web page have a lasting impact on their opinions. We all know that first impressions count, but this study shows that the brain can make flash judgements almost as fast as the eye can take in the information. The discovery came as a surprise to some experts. \"My colleagues believed it would be impossible to really see anything in less than 500 milliseconds,\" says Gitte Lindgaard of Carleton University in Ottawa, who has published the research in the journal  Behaviour and Information Technology 1 . Instead they found that impressions were made in the first 50 milliseconds of viewing. Lindgaard and her team presented volunteers with the briefest glimpses of web pages previously rated as being either easy on the eye or particularly jarring, and asked them to rate the websites on a sliding scale of visual appeal. Even though the images flashed up for just 50 milliseconds, roughly the duration of a single frame of standard television footage, their verdicts tallied well with judgements made after a longer period of scrutiny.  In the crowded and competitive world of the web, companies hoping to make millions from e-commerce should take notice, the researchers say. \"Unless the first impression is favourable, visitors will be out of your site before they even know that you might be offering more than your competitors,\" Lindgaard warns.  \n              First impressions last \n            For a typical commercial website, 60% of traffic comes from search engines such as Google, says Marc Caudron of London web-design agency Pod1. This makes a user's first impression even more critical, he explains. \"You'll get a list of sites, click the top one, and then either say 'I've engaged' and give it a few more seconds, or just go back to Google,\" he says. The lasting effect of first impressions is known to psychologists as the 'halo effect': if you can snare people with an attractive design, they are more likely to overlook other minor faults with the site, and may rate its actual content (such as this article, for example) more favourably.  This is because of 'cognitive bias', Lindgaard explains. People enjoy being right, so continuing to use a website that gave a good first impression helps to 'prove' to themselves that they made a good initial decision. The phenomenon pervades our society; even doctors have been shown to follow their initial hunches, Lindgaard says, relying heavily on a patient's most immediately obvious symptom when making a diagnosis. \"It's awfully scary stuff, but the tendency to jump to conclusions is far more widespread than we realize,\" she says.  \n              Beauty and beholders \n            So what are the key ingredients of a good-looking website? Caudron suggests that the amount of graphics on the page should be strictly limited, perhaps to a single eye-catching image. \"It's not about getting as much stuff on the page as possible,\" he says.  These days, enlightened web users want to see a \"puritan\" approach, Caudron adds. It's about getting information across in the quickest, simplest way possible. For this reason, many commercial websites now follow a fairly regular set of rules. For example, westerners tend to look at the top-left corner of a page first, so that's where the company logo should go. And most users also expect to see a search function in the top right. Of course, says Caudron, the other golden rule is to make sure that your web pages load quickly, otherwise your customers might not stick around long enough to make that coveted first impression. \"That can be the difference between big business and no business,\" he says.

The appetite-control hormone leptin staves off symptoms of stress in rats, and might lead to new ways to fight human depression, say researchers in the United States. Leptin is famed for controlling our weight and appetite. But the hormone, which is released by fat cells and gives the brain a reading of our fat stores, is also thought to act in brain areas involved in emotion.  To explore this link, Xin-Yun Lu and her colleagues at the University of Texas Health Science Center in San Antonio stressed rats by, for example, separating them from other animals. The rats' leptin levels plunged at the same time that they showed behavioural changes such as losing interest in a sugary drink, the kind of apathy that is often associated with human depression.  The team found that injections of leptin into otherwise healthy animals were as good as at least one known treatment in a test widely used to screen for new antidepressants. In this test, the researchers showed that leptin could help the animals to evade depression-induced behaviour when forced to swim. The results, which the team report in the  Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 1 , are sure to trigger interest in those working on alternative therapies for depression. Many patients do not respond to existing treatments and doctors are keen to find more.  But they caution that much more work is needed before leptin becomes a candidate treatment for the blues. Because the hormone also exerts effects on appetite, reproduction and the immune system, medical researchers would probably need to find molecules that can specifically mimic leptin's anti-depressant effects on the brain without causing unwanted side effects.  It also isn't clear how well leptin's effect in animals is mirrored in people. The findings do fit with a few small studies suggesting that leptin levels are altered in people with depression. \"It's very, very interesting,\" says Giovanni Cizza, who studies hormones and depression at the National Institute for Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Disease in Bethesda, Maryland. But, he adds, \"Depression is a very human phenomenon, so I take it with a grain of salt.\"  \n              Fat chance \n            Leptin shot to fame in the mid 1990s when scientists discovered that a strain of immensely fat mice that eat voraciously lack a working copy of the gene. They found that leptin injections could help the mice to shed weight, raising the prospect that the hormone might be a miraculous fat fighter for the obese.   That hope was dealt a blow when leptin failed to fight flab for most people in clinical trials. Since then, scientists have realized that obese people often have high levels of leptin and seem to have become resistant to its effects. And now they know that the hormone has a host of other roles in the body too. The new study raises questions about the link between appetite and mood. Many depressed patients lose weight and their interest in eating; a minority start to eat more. Experts say that low levels of leptin could conceivably fuel both depression and changes in appetite. Lu and other researchers acknowledge that many factors, including the availability of tempting food and associations between eating and comfort, influence what and how much we consume. \"It's affected by many, many things,\" says Cizza. \"But leptin is a big player.\" \n                   Antidepressants In Focus \n                 \n                   Food In Focus \n                 Reprints and Permissions"},

NASA is readying to send a speedy craft out to the edges of our Solar System, to give us our first ever close-up of Pluto. The New Horizons mission, which is due to launch from Florida on 17 January, will zoom past the Moon in just nine hours, travelling at a speed nearly 100 times that of a jet plane. The piano-sized craft is then scheduled to swing past Jupiter in 2007 picking up a gravity 'sling-shot' that will speed up its travel to Pluto. If all goes according to plan, the craft should reach Pluto by mid-2015.  The smallest planet in our Solar System, Pluto is the only one that has not yet been visited by a spacecraft (see Box). It is located at the outermost zone of the Solar System, known as the Kuiper belt. Here a series of comets and icy planetary objects left over from the birth of the Solar System reside. Pluto has been the subject of a great debate: is it a planet, or simply a large object that belongs to the Kuiper belt? New Horizons might help to shed light on this philosophical question by finding out a little more about the object. The mission should help to determine whether it has an atmosphere, for example, and whether it is completely round or is mis-shapen.  The mission has suffered several setbacks on its way to launch, thanks to noise-plagued instruments and production delays. But now things look set to go. In order to get a boost by sling-shotting around Jupiter, the craft needs to be launched by 3 February. Later launch dates will see it miss this opportunity, pushing its arrival at Pluto back by years.  \n              Low energy \n            The craft has been designed to run on low power for most of its long haul. Once it passes Jupiter, a modest power input equivalent to that needed to run two light bulbs will keep critical instruments on and will run yearly system check-ups. Otherwise it will be 'asleep' for the remainder of the trip. \"It's sort of like being on a long stretch of countryside road on a long bus tour,\" said co-investigator Ralph McNutt Jr, of Johns Hopkins Applied Physics lab where the craft was designed and built. Once New Horizons reaches its goal of Pluto, a host of instruments will power up, says McNutt. The small craft is packed with imaging infrared and ultraviolet spectrometers, a multicolour camera, a long-range telescopic camera, two particle spectrometers and a University of Colorado at Boulder student-designed space-dust collector.  These instruments will look at things such as the effects of the solar wind on Pluto and determine the presence and composition of Pluto's atmosphere.  \n              Bang for your buck \n            In recent years Pluto and its neighbourhood have unfolded a series of surprises. In 2001, astronomers discovered a number of other systems similar to Pluto and its moon in the Kuiper belt. And in 2005, two extra moons were found around Pluto. Because New Horizons was originally designed just to look at Pluto and its single known moon Charon, project scientist Hal Weaver notes that they will be able to \"look at four for the price of two\". \"In a sense, it was 'let's go see the oddball,'\" says Mike Brown, a planetary scientist from the California Institute of Technology, about the original motivation to visit Pluto. \"Now it's 'hey, it's not such an oddball',\" he laughs.

Avian flu ravages tissues throughout the body, confirms an autopsy of infected cats. The finding suggests that the virus might infect people's guts through what they eat, and spread via contaminated faeces. Fears about bird flu continue to balloon, and with its arrival in Turkey, the disease has a foot in the door in Europe. The H5N1 strain of the virus has killed more than half of those people it is known to have infected. Because of fears that the virus will spark a human pandemic, researchers want to know how it is likely to attack the body and jump between people. But they have had little opportunity to answer these questions, in part because only a handful of human victims have been autopsied.  \n              Caught in cats \n           So a team led by Thijs Kuiken at the Erasmus Medical Centre in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, carried out detailed autopsies of infected cats; these mammals are thought to be a reasonable model for human infections. This allowed them to catch a glimpse of the virus at the peak of an infection, rather than waiting until after death. The team first reported that the H5N1 flu strain could infect domestic cats 1  in 2004, a discovery that was startling because cats were previously thought to be immune to the flu. In a follow-up study, published in the  American Journal of Pathology  this month 2 , they carefully probed the tissues of eight infected animals.  The virus wreaks havoc in the brain, liver, kidney, heart and numerous other tissues, they find, killing cells and triggering inflammation. By contrast, the flu viruses that strike people in winter largely limit their damage to the nose and lungs.  This discovery backs up earlier studies in mice and ferrets, and may help to explain why the bird flu kills so many of the humans it infects. \"It's promiscuous,\" says veterinary pathologist Corrie Brown, who studies infectious diseases at the University of Georgia, Athens. \"It doesn't care what type of cell it invades.\"  \n              Pass it on \n            The cat survey highlights two more worrying facts about the virus. The team find that H5N1 can be excreted in cat faeces as well as from the lungs.  Researchers think that people mostly catch the disease by breathing in virus from contaminated bird droppings, but it has not been clear that it could spread between mammals by a faecal-oral route too.  This suggests that avian flu might spread in water contaminated with people's infected faeces or urine as well as in coughed-out droplets. Should a human pandemic begin, this could be a major problem in developing countries where poor sanitation would fuel spread of the disease. \"We do need to be aware,\" Kuiken says.  \n              Careful what you eat \n            The team also find evidence, for the first time, that the virus can directly attack nerve cells in the gut of cats fed infected chicken meat.   This suggests the virus can directly attack the human intestine too, reinforcing current advice to avoid raw, infected meat. Kuiken says the finding could also explain two reported cases of human avian flu in which patients developed diarrhoea and encephalitis rather than the classic respiratory symptoms.  Researchers already knew that the H5N1 virus, like other pathogenic avian flu viruses, spreads throughout the body of birds. But they are only beginning to identify the genetic tricks that allow H5N1 to march into so many tissues.  Experts are still struggling to predict whether the virus will begin to spread swiftly between humans at all. \"I think the greatest precaution we can take now is to control it in birds,\" Brown says, \"That's the seething cauldron of the virus.\" Cats are not expected to be a major reservoir for the disease.

Environmentalists are going to court against the Canadian government in an attempt to protect critically endangered spotted owls. A consortium of four environmental groups will enter evidence on 23 January, in a Vancouver-based federal court, that the British Columbia government has been negligent in safeguarding the owls. They hope to force the federal government to implement a draft plan to save the less than two dozen northern spotted owls ( Strix occidentalis caurina ) known to exist. The lawsuit, filed in December 2005, is the first legal challenge on the back of the Canadian Species at Risk Act, which has come into effect during the past few years. Under this act, provincial governments are obliged to implement safeguards for endangered species. If they don't, the federal government can step in. The environmental groups say Canada has been lax in applying the act across a host of threatened animals and plant species. They want to use the spotted owl as a test case to bring attention to the problem, and to force both provincial and federal governments to act.  \n              Setting an example \n           \"This is a critical test case,\" says mammalogist Rick Smith, executive director of Environmental Defence Canada, one of the four litigating groups. \"Right now, the government's failure to act is an extinction policy.\" The act was brought into being to bring Canada into compliance with the international Convention on Biological Diversity, which the country ratified in 1992. There are thought to be just 22 northern spotted owls, living in a region of old-growth forest bounded by Vancouver, Hope and Lillooet. Provincial scientists studying the owls recommended in 2003 that logging of old-growth forest be halted in the areas where the owls live. But logging continues. Environmentalists argue that timber companies have pressured the province not to take steps to protect old-growth forests. Mark Zacharias, acting director of species at risk with British Columbia's Ministry of Agriculture and Lands, says that the provincial government plans to announce proposed habitat protections and population-boosting methods this spring. But environmentalists say they are tired of waiting.  \n              Last hope \n            Devon Page, a Vancouver attorney for the Sierra Legal Defence Fund, the organization that filed the lawsuit, says the birds may die off before the government acts. \"The owl is the most endangered species in Canada,\" says Page. \"They are projected to be extinct by 2010.\"  Paul Wood, a biologist and forestry expert at the University of British Columbia who studies conservation policy, said the court case \"will have precedent-setting environmental and constitutional impacts.\" It is rare in Canada for the federal government to step in on matters of provincial jurisdiction.

The World Health Organization (WHO) is calling for pharmaceutical companies to stop marketing a key malarial drug as a single, as opposed to combination, treatment amidst fears that the malaria parasite will develop resistance to the drug. On 19 January, WHO representatives in Washington DC announced that although most countries have adopted combination therapies as their first line of treatment, many have not yet pulled their practices into line with their policies. Out of 34 African countries committed to combination therapies, at least ten still allow the distribution of artemisinin, one of the most effective antimalarials, on its own. Experts worry that this practice will encourage the parasite to become resistant to artemisinin, with disastrous consequences for malaria treatment. \"If we lose artemisinin, we will no longer have an effective cure for malaria,\" says Arata Kochi, director of the WHO's malaria department. If the bug is blitzed with a combination of drugs instead, the chances of it evolving resistance are minimized. The day before the announcement, the WHO met with pharmaceutical companies to go over their new malaria treatment guidelines, and to ask them to stop marketing artemisinin as a single drug. Half of these companies already produce the combination therapy as well as the single-drug therapy, says Andrea Bosman, a medical officer with the Roll Back Malaria programme. He says the cost of such a shift \"would be very minimal\". Artemisinin combination therapies currently are the single most effective treatment to cure malaria. These combination therapies have a 95% cure rate and work more quickly than artemisinin alone, but can be more expensive.  \n              Past mistakes repeated? \n            The malaria parasite has a history of overcoming antimalarial drugs. The once-popular chloroquine, for example, is no longer effective in many parts of the world. Sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine lost about 90% of its effectiveness in Thailand within five years of being introduced in 1977. And the parasite became resistant to atovaquone within just one year of its introduction in 1997. \"We cannot afford to repeat mistakes from the past,\" says Kochi. \"The only way to beat malaria is to be ahead of the parasite and counter drug resistance before it develops.\" There are no signs of resistance to artemisinin so far, but with other drug options still many years down the pipeline, healthcare officials do not want to take the chance.  \n              Single-drug bans \n            A dozen malaria-endemic countries have systems in place to restrict the marketing and availability of a single-drug form of artemisinin, says Bosman. Sudan, for instance, has a ban on the import of these monotherapies.  But Bosman says at least seven pharmaceutical companies with a strong presence in Africa are still marketing single-drug treatments. Herwig Jansen, research and medical director of Dafra Pharma, told  news@nature.com  that they are aware of the problem and will try to comply with the guidelines. \"It's not that easy,\" says Jansen. Jansen says that a large part of the market is still flooded with single-drug-based treatments in countries where it is being distributed. He warns that a sudden ban, rather than a phase out, may cause people to resort to cheaper forms of treatment that are less effective and already have resistance problems. Malaria afflicts approximately 350 million to 500 million people worldwide, most of which are in Africa and Southeast Asia. One child dies every 30 seconds from this disease. Due to the large numbers of people affected, Bosman says, malaria is a billion-dollar market for pharmaceutical companies.

Is NASA engaging in censorship, or just running a tight ship? That's the question regarding allegations published in the  New York Times  last weekend that NASA tried to prevent one of its foremost climate researchers, James Hansen of the Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York, from speaking to the press. Hansen made a speech on 6 December at an American Geophysical Union meeting in San Francisco calling for prompt action to dramatically reduce greenhouse gas emissions \u2014 a message that runs against the grain of the Bush administration's current policies. Since then, Hansen told the  Times , NASA's public affairs office in Washington has insisted on screening material he presents to the public, and on one occasion an agency press officer turned down a journalist's request for an interview with Hansen. The press officer, George Deutsch, is a political appointee and recent graduate of Texas A&M University.  \n              Gag orders \n            Hansen may not be alone in his complaint. Steven Beckwith, a Johns Hopkins University astronomer and former head of the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, says NASA has been known to \"forbid its staff from talking to the press\"; this includes at least one agency scientist he knows of who spoke out on the politically sensitive subject of whether the Hubble Space Telescope's life should be extended. While Beckwith sympathizes with NASA's desire to coordinate information that goes out to the public, he says agency officials can sometimes be \"too controlling for their own good.\" But David Goldston, who is chief of staff for the House Science Committee, says that \"it does not appear to be a generic problem\". \"We do not believe that [NASA Administrator] Mike Griffin wants or is telling others to stifle scientists in any way,\" he told  news@nature.com .  \n              Under control? \n            Dean Acosta, NASA's press secretary and himself a political appointee, is unapologetic about the agency's need to control what its employees, including the scientists, are saying.  In a statement last week, Acosta said, \"Our policy \u2014 which is similar to that of any other federal agency, corporation or news organization, is that any NASA employee speaking on the record, issuing a press release, or posting information on our website, must coordinate such activities with the Office of Public Affairs. No exceptions.\"  But House Science committee chairman Sherwood Boehlert (Republican, New York) wants to make sure \"message control\" doesn't cross over into censorship. Boehlert has ordered his staff to look into the matter, and issued his own statement last week charging that \"NASA is clearly doing something wrong, given the sense of intimidation felt by Dr. Hansen.\"  Goldston says he is still trying to understand what actually happened between Hansen and NASA headquarters. \"The reality is going to be more complicated than either [NASA's position of] 'all we wanted was advance notification', and some grand conspiracy designed systematically, from the top, to crack down on Jim Hansen and his ilk,\" Goldston told  news@nature.com . \"The truth is in between those two.\" Post a comment to this story by visiting our  newsblog House Science committee chairman \n                   Hansen\u2019s original AGU speech \n                 Reprints and Permissions"},

The more times we have walked a route, the longer we judge it to be, a UK researcher has confirmed. His studies could help explain why daily commutes can grow to seem interminably long. Neuroscientists have long known that our brains are poor at estimating a set distance such as a kilometre. But most studies of this phenomenon have been carried out in simple artificial environments where, for example, people walk along paths taped out in a gymnasium. Andrew Crompton at Manchester University, UK, wanted to see how good we are at judging distances in the real world.  He asked 140 architecture students in their first, second and third years of study to estimate the distance from the university's student-union building to familiar destinations along a straight road, so the length of journeys that they would have strolled (or staggered) many times. The more times students had walked the route, the further they estimated the journey to be. First year students, for example, estimated a mile-long path to be around 1.24 miles on average, while third year students stretched it to 1.45 miles. Crompton publishes his results in  Environment and Behavior 1 .  The results match those from other studies in which, for example, people moving through a virtual world tend to overestimate how far they have travelled. \"It seems to fit in with an emerging theme,\" says Laurence Harris who has carried out such experiments at York University in Toronto.  \n              Knowing your route \n            The finding backs the idea that distances elongate in our minds because, over time, we begin to notice more and more minutiae about a route, an idea called the feature-accumulation theory. \"As detail accumulates, the distance seems to get bigger,\" Crompton says. To test this idea, he took a group of students to Portmeirion, a small Italianate village on the North Wales coast in which the eccentric buildings are small and colourful.  After walking around the tourist spot, students guessed that a 500-metre-long path in the village was around three times its actual length. The same students estimated a 500-metre path in the less-eccentric and more familiar city of Manchester to be around 1.6 times its length 2 .  \n              Tricks of perception \n            There could be other explanations for some of Crompton's findings. A walk by the third-year students might have seemed further than it was simply because the students took longer to amble along a familiar or picturesque route, for example.  But the finding does gel with neuroscientists' ideas that distance, like time, is an abstract concept in our brains, rather than an absolute one. \"The world isn't just a picture; it depends on how you engage with it,\" says James Wise, who studies how people perceive environments at Washington State University, Tri-Cities. \"They're a couple of great little papers,\" adds Wise. \"Crompton has a very ingenious way of using the real world as a laboratory.\" Crompton next plans to test how far a mile seems to students in a variety of other spaces, from airfields to forests and the road-tangled British town of Milton Keynes.  \n              The long road home \n            The studies might help to account for the anecdotal experience that a walk to a destination sometimes feels shorter than the journey back; or that a regular commute seems to lengthen with time.  Further experiments are needed to find out precisely what is going on in the brain when we attempt to gauge distance. One option is to use a virtual reality simulator, in which it is possible to have walkers navigate down routes with strictly controlled numbers of twists, turns, and landmarks, in order to weed out what makes the biggest difference to our perception of distance. Whatever the cause of the effect, it might prove useful to architects and urban planners, says Crompton. His results support the idea that buildings or towns incorporating irregularities or details feel more spacious than plainer cityscapes, he notes. \"We can make space out of nothing.\" \n                   Portmeirion \n                 Reprints and Permissions"},

The premiere of a documentary on the controversy surrounding intelligent design drew a sell-out crowd of 300 to a movie theater in Overland Park, Kansas on 2 February. Randy Olson, a marine biologist and filmmaker, wrote, directed, and narrates the film,  Flock of Dodos: the Evolution-Intelligent Design Circus . Olson believes in evolution, but he does not set out to debunk the arguments behind the intelligent design (ID) movement. Instead, the film shows ID's proponents, backed by a huge public-relations budget, winning over the American public.  Scientists' ideas, in contrast, are lost amid jargon and intellectual snobbery. Scientists, the film hints, may be the real dodos, risking extinction by not adapting to a changing media environment. \"I firmly believe in the analogy with natural selection,\" says Olson. \"Science has backed into this lumbering, conservative corner with no flexibility to deal with something like ID when it comes up.\"  Olson grew up in Kansas before heading to Harvard for a doctorate in evolutionary marine ecology. He moved to Los Angeles in 1994 to work on film-making and marine biology at the University of Southern California (USC).  \n              Pompous boors \n             Flock  opens with Olson's mother sending him newspaper clippings from Kansas, circling the name of her neighbour, John Calvert, a national leader of the ID movement. Olson heads to Kansas to interview Calvert and cover the recent Kansas school board hearings, which ended with the adoption of science standards in November 2005 that include teaching \"the scientific criticisms of the theory [of evolution]\". He also travels to Dover, Pennsylvania, as that school board wrestles with the issue in court. And he plays poker with several colleagues from his graduate-school days at Harvard.  The scientists in the film come across as pompous boors who shout each other down. The audience chuckles as Olson asks USC palaeontologist David Bottjer whether evolutionists have a catchphrase to counter the ID motto 'Teach the Controversy'. After a lengthy, dull explanation that there is no controversy, Bottjer says, \"No, I haven't heard a catchphrase, have you?\"  Viewers from both sides agreed that scientists lack communication skills. \"They couldn't talk in the language of the common man,\" says Subbiah Ramasamy, a senior biology student at Blue Valley North high school in Overland Park who attended the screening. \"If they can't communicate with each other, how are they going to communicate with us?\" After the screening, a panel of experts from the film (three for ID and three for evolution) fielded questions. The discussion, complete with boos and cheers, revealed the fervour surrounding the Kansas school board's decision.  A comment from Calvert equating teaching evolution with promoting atheism drew grumbles from the crowd, which was roughly two-thirds pro-evolution. His position - that teaching science based only on natural explanations and physical laws promotes an atheistic ideology - is an argument now typical within the ID movement.  That position is destructive, argues Steven Case, an education researcher at University of Kansas in Lawrence. \"That means we are setting kids up to be anti-intellectual or have a crisis of faith. Neither one of those things should be going on in a public school, that's not what we do,\" Case says in the film.  Olson presents the audience with fairly dense material, but leavens it with comic relief and heartfelt narration. Moviegoers from both sides of the debate laughed at the animated dodos that take over for the talking heads, groaned at the politics, and applauded a picture of George W. Bush hanging in one Kansas home. \"It was clearly a success,\" Olson says. The film has since played to sell-out crowds on the at Harvard, Stony Brook, Yale, and Cornell universities on the US east coast. Further screenings are planned at Rice University in Houston, Florida State, and Kansas State universities in March. Olson intends to enter the documentary in film festivals, and hopes to secure a distributor for an eventual DVD release.

The president of Harvard University, Larry Summers, resigned yesterday in the face of growing faculty discontent over his leadership of one of the world's top academic institutions. Summers announced his resignation after several weeks of criticism from faculty members, triggered by the departure of William Kirby, dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, the university's biggest school. The announcement came a week before members of this faculty were due to hold a vote of no confidence in Summers.  \"Everyone is abuzz,\" says Everett Mendelsohn, a professor of the history of science who has been a critic of Summers. Summers, an economist who once served as the United States' treasury secretary, had stirred things up at Harvard since he arrived in 2001. His ambitious plans for the university, including overhauling undergraduate education and building a new campus in the Allston neighbourhood of Boston, were criticized by some academic staff. They objected to his forceful leadership style and said that they were not sufficiently consulted about plans for the university.  This disgruntlement became vocal in spring 2005, after Summers made comments suggesting that biological differences between the sexes could explain why so few women become top scientists. In March last year, the Faculty of Arts and Sciences passed a vote of no confidence in Summers, by 218 to 185.  \n              Sorry doesn't cut it \n            Summers apologized for his comments and pledged to listen to faculty concerns. But tensions flared again this year after Kirby's departure. \"This was a situation that just wasn't working,\" says Harvard historian Laurel Thatcher Ulrich. Summers will continue as president until the start of July and the end of the academic year. After that, Derek Bok, Harvard's president from 1971-91, will serve as interim president until a successor is chosen.  Faculty members say that they hope Summers's resignation will not do lasting damage to the prestigious university, founded in 1636, or the projects that he championed, such as the Harvard Stem Cell Institute. They also hope that the Harvard Corporation, the governing body that will choose the new president, will select a successor better able to listen to the faculty, while still carving out a strong path for the university. \"I'm very sorry that things got to this point,\" says physicist Charles Marcus, who says that he liked and supported Summers. \"We need someone who has vision, guts and an independent mind.

Time travel, multiple universes and extraterrestrial intelligence might seem more the purview of  Star Trek  scriptwriters than of serious researchers. But the scientists behind a new institute have announced their intention to change that perception. On 27 February, the Foundational Questions Institute (FQI) made its inaugural call for proposals from scientists interested in asking the really big, and really odd, questions about the Universe \u2014 questions such as: why does time flow in a single direction, or, can intelligence survive in our Universe in the very long term? \u201cThese are the very questions that a lot of scientists got into physics and cosmology to tackle,\u201d says Anthony Aguirre, a cosmologist at the University of California, Santa Cruz, and the FQI's associate scientific director. \u201cBut they don't tackle them, because they either don't have time or don't have monetary support.\u201d The institute's directors hope it will remedy this. The FQI was set up last October with a grant from the John Templeton Foundation, which promotes research at the boundary of religion and science. With US$8 million in seed money from the foundation, the FQI will fund dozens of researchers' part-time work on these questions, Aguirre says. All proposals will be peer reviewed, he adds. \u201cI'm very happy to see that a project has started to address these needs,\u201d says Lee Smolin of the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics in Waterloo, Ontario, who is also on the FQI's scientific advisory board. Smolin says he believes the project will help shake up the current culture, \u201cwhich emphasizes technical brilliance over ambition and originality\u201d. But not everyone welcomes the institute's unusual remit.

The abrupt sacking of two editors of a medical journal has been blamed on political differences between them and the journal's owners. With the editorial board fighting to have the two reinstated, the case has focused attention on the issue of editorial freedom for journals owned by academic societies. John Hoey, former editor of the  Canadian Medical Association Journal  ( CMAJ ), and his deputy Anne Marie Todkill were sacked on 20 February. Since then, 16 of 18 editorial board members have signed a letter asking the CMA to reinstate them. But Graham Morris, president of CMA Media, the company that publishes the journal, denies his decision had anything to do with editorial freedom. \u201cHoey did a good job in building the reputation of the journal,\u201d says Morris, adding that he is simply looking for \u201ca fresh approach\u201d. But Hoey and Morris have often locked horns. For example, Hoey ran an editorial in the 3 January 2006 issue detailing changes he says he was forced to make to an article about emergency contraception. As part of a news story on whether pharmacists were asking users unnecessary questions before dispensing the \u2018Plan B\u2019 pill, the  CMAJ  asked women across Canada to buy the pill from local pharmacies and report their experiences. According to Hoey, the Canadian Pharmacists' Association pressured the CMA into insisting that the investigation could not be published without peer review. Morris says he wasn't influenced by the pharmacists, and that the decision to remove the section about the investigation left a \u201cwell-balanced\u201d piece. There were also deep-seated differences between the journal editors and the CMA over privatization of health care, according to Trudo Lemmens, a medical ethicist at the University of Toronto. In August, the CMA voted to support a Supreme Court ruling that ended the ban on private health care in Quebec. The  CMAJ  however, is perceived to be against any erosion of the nation's public medical system. According to Hoey, a news story on incoming health minister Tony Clemens, which included critical quotes about Clemens's acceptance of privatization was pulled by the management. Jerome Kassirer, a member of the  CMAJ 's editorial board, points out that the journal has been doing well, making Morris's call for a change seem oddly timed: \u201cGiven that the journal was getting better, was more respected, and its impact factor was going up, it's hard to escape the conclusion that they were fired for political reasons.\u201d Fiona Godlee, editor of the  British Medical Journal , says she was \u201cshocked and saddened\u201d by the news. She worries that the  CMAJ  may now recede into relative obscurity. \u201cI think it is extremely damaging for the reputation of the journal.\u201d Godlee hopes the firings will stiffen the resolve of journal editors to fight for a strong wall between their editorial content and the politics of home associations. \u201cIt is beholden on editors in general to hold the line for the sake of maintaining independent scientific voices around the world.\u201d Also \u201cvery concerned\u201d about the sackings is Shabbir Alibhai, a specialist in cancer and geriatrics at the University of Toronto and member of the  CMAJ 's reader panel. But Alibhai says the episode raises questions about the role of journal editors, particularly when writing editorials. \u201cWho is the editor representing when he or she pens words?\u201d he asks. \u201cThe readers? The association? The journal? Or just the editors?\u201d Meanwhile editorial board member Philip Devereaux is widely distributing a petition to reinstate the editors. \u201cThis is one of the most fundamental battles, and it must be fought,\u201d he says. \u201cIt's not just because John and Anne Marie are really nice people.\u201d \n                     Media attack prompts editorial backlash against MMR study \n                   \n                     Medical journals tackle biased reporting of results \n                   \n                     Medical editors urged to accept ethical code \n                   \n                     Journal grows suspicious of Vioxx data \n                   \n                     Medical research news \n                   \n                     Petition to reinstate John Hoey and Anne Marie Todkill \n                   \n                     CMAJ  editorial on the Plan B matter \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Munich Plans announced last week to create a European Institute of Technology (EIT) have received a lukewarm reception from the scientific community. The new body is being touted as the European counterpart of the US Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). It will aim to translate research into commercial opportunities and jobs. But many are sceptical about what the \u2018virtual\u2019 institution, which would consist of partnerships between academic and industry research groups across Europe, is likely to achieve. Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso, president of the European Commission, outlined plans for the EIT on 22 February. He said it would be \u201ca light and flexible organization\u201d that will foster education, research and innovation in commercially promising fields of science. But he gave few details about how much the institute is likely to cost, or the research areas it will target. A proposal to create a centre for the EIT in the European parliament building in Strasbourg was discarded, mainly because choosing a single site would have been interpreted as favouring a particular country or region. So the institute will be made up of partnerships in which members of research groups working on a particular area will spend time in each others' labs. If approved by the European Council later this month, the initiative could be up and running by 2010. But scientists doubt that the proposed network will yield anything as efficient as MIT, with its annual budget of $2 billion. The proposed structure is scarcely different from research collaborations already funded by the European Union, says Renzo Rubele, a theoretical physicist at the University of Salerno in Italy, and a member of an expert group on university research. To make a real difference, he adds, would require a powerhouse like the particle-physics lab CERN in Geneva, Switzerland, where people and ideas are continuously exchanged. Science managers are also unconvinced. \u201cIn principle, a European MIT would be a good thing. But at this stage it is an ill-prepared political rush job,\u201d says Helga Nowotny, vice-president of the scientific council of the proposed European Research Council and former chair of the European Research Advisory Board. \u201cWhat Europe really lacks in terms of innovation is sufficient venture capital for spin-off companies,\u201d she says. \u201cThe EIT cannot solve that problem.\u201d Nowotny adds that although clusters of academic and industrial research work well at the regional level, she doesn't believe sending industry researchers to distant university labs will boost innovation. Barroso is confident that industry will take the bait, however. This could be crucial for the EIT, as it is still unclear how the institute will be financed. Several European companies, including Pirelli and Nokia, have welcomed the idea, but have not specified what they might contribute.

Washington DC Picture this: two people, eager to prevent future ailments, order genetic tests over the Internet. The results are sobering \u2014 risks of osteoporosis, heart disease, diabetes and more. Affiliated companies then offer nutritional supplements to stave off these predicted sicknesses \u2014 but the pills turn out to be little more than multivitamins, offered with a hefty dose of misleading medical advice. Fortunately, these two people are fictitious, part of an investigation conducted by the US Government Accountability Office (GAO). The inquiry found that 'nutrigenetic' tests, combining diet advice with genetics testing, are at best ambiguous and at worst dangerous. On 27 July, the Senate special committee on ageing conducted a very public grilling of company representatives and federal regulators. Participants heard that the GAO had surreptitiously tested four companies that offer home genetic testing to consumers. Three of the four testified: Genelex, based in Seattle, Washington; Sciona of Boulder, Colorado; and Suracell of Montclair, New Jersey. Investigators posed as 14 consumers but used the DNA from just two people, a 48-year-old man and a 9-month-old girl. Despite this, the test 'results' were contradictory and warned of risks for various conditions. \u201cIt's clear they went way out ahead of the science,\u201d says Alan Guttmacher, deputy director of the US National Human Genome Research Institute in Bethesda, Maryland. Two of the companies disagree. Howard Coleman, chief executive of Genelex, claimed at the hearing that the investigation's results were made specious by the 14 differing 'lifestyle questionnaires' that the investigators submitted along with the DNA samples. The cost of at-home genetic tests in the study ranged from $89 to $395. Some are tantamount to \u201cgenetic horoscopes\u201d, said Thomas Hamilton, director of the survey and certification group at the US government's Center for Medicaid and State Operations. Unlike other witnesses, however, he argued that more regulation is not needed. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) also monitors some such tests because they count as medical 'devices', says Steven Gutman, director of the agency's office for diagnostic devices. The agency is investigating whether some of the tests should have undergone FDA review, he says.

Washington DC In a move poorly received by key members of the US Congress, NASA last week said that it might shut down scientific research on the International Space Station for at least a year, to save money. NASA is struggling to fund its mission to send astronauts back to the Moon, while spending around $200 million a year on research in the station. But Congress has mandated, as part of the 2005 NASA Authorization Act, that the agency should carry out \u201cto the maximum extent practicable, basic, applied, and commercial research aboard the International Space Station\u201d. The act also specifies that NASA should allocate at least 15% of the funds budgeted for space-station research to experiments not directly related to the human exploration programme. \u201cThe International Space Station is first and foremost a space laboratory,\u201d says Katie Boyd, a spokeswoman for Senator Richard Shelby (Republican, Alabama). His state hosts the Marshall Space Flight Center, which manages science work aboard the space station. \u201cTo suggest that NASA would not take advantage of this unique laboratory is shortsighted.\u201d A NASA spokesman, Grey Hautaluoma, said that he could not comment on ongoing budgetary discussions.\u201cRight now, that funding is still there,\u201d he says. About three dozen experiments are currently under way on the station, from biology set-ups that use the the astronauts as guinea pigs, to aeronautics experiments that use polyhedrons to test flight-control algorithms. A year-long hiatus from research would mean more than missing data points. Restarting stalled projects will require staff to be rehired and equipment replaced. In the end, taking time off from research would probably cost more than it saved. \u201cI can't believe that they would discuss this with a straight face,\u201d says former NASA employee Keith Cowing, who broke the story on his website, NASA Watch.

Quirin Schiermeier talks to the experts trying to make sense of the measurements. It took 18 years, but Paul Crutzen and Eugenio Sanhueza finally found a use for their data. In 1988, the two atmospheric chemists had discovered large amounts of the greenhouse gas methane building up at night over Venezuela. This March, they dusted off their data and used them to calculate a surprising number: that the world's tropical savannahs may produce 30 million to 60 million tonnes of methane each year 1 . Remarkably, that number is similar to one reported in January, when a German chemist announced that living plants give off methane 2 . His claim rattled many, because textbooks hold that methane is produced from organic matter decaying in oxygen-free environments, not from living plants. If true, his finding could account for a substantial fraction of the methane entering the atmosphere \u2014 potentially throwing off calculations of how much humans contribute. In the past seven months, atmospheric scientists have scrutinized the discovery, and they're finding that methane does not yield up its secrets easily. Some, like Crutzen, find the work convincing. \u201cWe could have seen the effect a long time ago, but we missed the boat,\u201d says Crutzen, who works at the Max Planck Institute (MPI) for Chemistry in Mainz, Germany, and shared the 1995 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his work on atmospheric ozone. Sanhueza works at the Venezuelan Institute for Scientific Investigations in Caracas. Others are not swayed. \u201cI am not yet convinced that the effect is real,\u201d says David Beerling, a palaeoclimatologist at the University of Sheffield, UK. \u201cThe experiments leave a lot of questions open, and the findings still await independent verification.\u201d And some just aren't sure. \u201cThe new source is very hard to distinguish from known methane sources such as wetlands, and the scarce existing data can neither prove nor disprove its existence,\u201d says Martin Heimann, an atmospheric chemist at the MPI for Biogeochemistry in Jena, Germany. \n               Time to adjust \n             The debate began with the work of Frank Keppler, a geochemist at the MPI for Nuclear Physics in Heidelberg, Germany, and his colleagues. The researchers grew various plants in isolated chambers, then measured the background methane concentrations. The fluxes were tiny; but when extrapolated to global vegetation they pointed to the existence of a huge, overlooked source of methane. Plants, it seemed, could account for up to 40% of total methane emissions (see ' Missing mechanism '). As a greenhouse gas, methane traps heat 20 times more efficiently than carbon dioxide, yet its sources and sinks are less well understood. Total methane emissions are estimated to be around 550 million tonnes per year. The known sources include wetlands, rice farming, the stomachs of ruminant animals, biomass burning, landfills and energy generation. And now, perhaps, plants. If Keppler is right, rapid tropical deforestation could explain why atmospheric methane concentrations stopped rising in the 1980s, after decades of increase. Looking further back in time, the effect could have played a role in the transition from glacial periods to warmer climates, says Thomas R\u00f6ckmann, an atmosphere researcher at the Utrecht University in the Netherlands. Warmer temperatures could mean more plants, which in turn produce more heat-trapping methane. But most researchers are cautious about jumping to conclusions, particularly in extrapolating Keppler's laboratory observations to global values. Keppler calculated a global source in the range of 62 million\u2013236 million tonnes per year. Other ways of scaling up his data suggest the source might be substantially smaller. For instance, critics say Keppler overestimated the amount of methane-producing plant tissue by basing his calculations on global 'net primary production' of vegetation, which includes roots and stems, rather than global leaf mass only. When climate modeller Miko Kirschbaum of the Cooperative Research Center for Greenhouse Accounting at the Australian National University in Canberra adjusted the calculation accordingly, he arrived at global emissions of only 10 million\u201360 million tonnes per year 3 . Others have looked at the carbon-isotope ratios of methane in ice cores. Different sources of methane yield different isotope signatures. A 2,000-year ice-core record from Antarctica yielded an upper limit of 46 million tonnes per year 4 . But not everyone is revising Keppler's findings downward. One new simulation, of how methane moves through the atmosphere, suggests that plants yield on the order of 125 million tonnes per year. Sander Houweling, of Utrecht University, simulated methane fluxes both with and without methane emissions from plants. He found that the results better match observations if vegetation is included as a source of methane 5 . Keppler, a co-author of this study, says he can \u201clive very well\u201d with attempts to re-interpret and downscale his findings. The 39-year-old researcher recently received a European Young Investigator Award, allowing him to continue work in the area for at least five more years. And he promises further surprises. Unpublished data from experiments carried out last year in Brazil, on five randomly selected plant species, show that some species emit up to 4,000 times more methane than others. If this is true, it will make it even more difficult to calculate the size of the global source, he says. If plants are giving off more methane than was thought, then another source of methane must have been overestimated. Most scientists suspect that this is wetlands. More unlikely, but politically more contentious, is the possibility that one or more of the human-related sources might be much smaller than was thought, says Johannes Lelieveld, a director of the MPI for Chemistry. The German gas company Ruhrgas has already asked Lelieveld whether it can revise downward its estimates of how much methane its power plants have emitted. \u201cThat's probably going too far,\u201d says Lelieveld. \u201cBut a major discovery like this does require reassessment of greenhouse-gas sources.\u201d As usual, more data would help. \u201cThe ultimate test is to do more and better measurements,\u201d says Ed Dlugokencky, an atmospheric chemist with the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in Boulder, Colorado, who oversees the methane part of a global air-sampling network. Dlugokencky is convinced that the effect is real. \u201cI'm not surprised we missed it,\u201d he says. \u201cOur network of 60 stations is just too small to be able to detect it, and we are particularly weak in the tropics where it seems to be most pronounced.\u201d \n               In flux \n             Another way to hunt methane could be from space. As reported last year, the European Envisat satellite has detected large plumes of methane over tropical rainforests 6 . But remote sensing cannot prove that the gas stems from trees, as opposed to swamps, bogs or wetlands underneath. \u201cYou can learn a lot from space,\u201d say Crutzen. \u201cBut to verify sources you need to go back to places such as Venezuela and Brazil and look at methane  in situ .\u201d Eddy-flux towers, which are already being used at more than 200 sites worldwide to measure the movement of carbon dioxide in and out of the atmosphere, might help. Methane is less abundant than carbon dioxide, and so harder to monitor. But new and more powerful lasers will measure gas concentrations more accurately. Soon, says Heimann, it may be possible to measure methane fluxes above tree canopies in real time \u2014 perhaps even tracing them back to individual plants. Such information should improve estimates of the global methane budget. With that, researchers hope to move closer to their ultimate goal: developing a computer model that accurately reproduces past climate and all its biospheric feedbacks. A model of the past should also provide projections for the future. \u201cYou need to understand the entire greenhouse budget,\u201d says Dlugokencky, \u201cbefore you can start thinking about mitigating climate change.\u201d \n                     Global change: A green source of surprise \n                   \n                     Methane finding baffles scientists \n                   \n                     Greenhouse gases level off \n                   \n                     Rapid climate change: Gas leak! \n                   \n                     Climate change in focus \n                   \n                     NOAA Global Monitoring Division \n                   \n                     Max Planck Institute for Chemistry \n                   \n                     Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics Journal \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Next week, by a simple show of hands at an astronomy meeting, Earth could go from being one of nine planets to one of twelve \u2014 with unknown numbers yet to be discovered. A seven-member panel appointed by the International Astronomical Union (IAU) has recommended a new definition of a planet: any body in orbit around a star that is not a star itself nor in orbit around a much larger planet, and that is massive enough for gravity to have squished it into an approximately spherical shape. The IAU planned to introduce the notion in a draft resolution on 16 August, after  Nature  went to press, and will discuss it on 22 August during an open session at its general assembly in Prague, Czech Republic. Two days later, if a simple majority of IAU members vote for it or a slightly revised version, that will become the official scientific word on the topic. Under the definition, most objects with a mass greater than 5\u00d710 20  kilograms, and typically with a diameter greater than 800 kilometres, would qualify as planets. That would instantly elevate the asteroid Ceres and Pluto's moon Charon to planet status, as Ceres is roughly spherical and Pluto and Charon can be described as a binary planet system. The Solar System's twelfth planet would be object 2003 UB 313 , nicknamed Xena, one of many 'trans-neptunian objects' lurking on the Solar System's fringes. Not all are happy with the 'roundness' criterion, however. \u201cIt's not what I think of when I think of a planet,\u201d says Michael Brown, an astronomer at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena and co-discoverer of UB 313 . \u201cI don't think of things that are a thousand times smaller than Earth.\u201d The discovery of UB 313  beyond Pluto's orbit last year brought matters to a head. Astronomers have estimated that it is at least 2,400 kilometres in diameter \u2014 larger than Pluto, but smaller than any of the other eight planets. All this demands a new definition of 'planet', some say. \u201cIf there is nothing accepted, we have to sit in the silly place where we are now: Pluto is a planet and UB 313  is not,\u201d says Iwan Williams, an astronomer at Queen Mary, University of London. Williams chaired an earlier IAU committee that was meant to define a planet, but it deadlocked last November. \u201cPeople came in with well-defined ideas of what a planet should be, expressed them strongly, and hardly anybody changed their mind,\u201d says committee member Alan Boss, an astronomer at the Carnegie Institute of Washington. Opinions were divided between three options to define a planet orbiting a star: any object with a diameter greater than 2,000 kilometres; any object massive enough for gravity to make it round; or any object that dominates its region of space. Faced with that stalemate, the IAU appointed another planet definition committee, chaired by astronomer and historian Owen Gingerich of Harvard University. The group met on 30 June for two days at the Paris Observatory. \u201cWe converged relatively quickly after the first day,\u201d says panel member Richard Binzel of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. A definition based on gravity, the group concluded, made the most scientific sense. \u201cIt involves the most physics,\u201d Binzel says. To acknowledge that trans-neptunian objects are different to the other planets, the committee proposed a subcategory of planets known as 'plutons'. These are planets that take more than 200 years to orbit the Sun and would include Pluto, Charon and UB 313 . The number of planets is likely to rise as more large trans-neptunian objects are found. After Ceres, other asteroids may also be eligible. Such changes may upset generations who grew up with nine planets. \u201cIf I have any concern, it's that the public will accept this,\u201d says astronomer Ron Ekers, president of the IAU. Binzel thinks there are ways around that. \u201cMy expectation is that children will memorize the eight classical planets, they will know that Ceres is a planet in the asteroid belt, and that there's a whole collection of planets out beyond Neptune, of which Pluto is the first.\u201d Convincing fellow astronomers may not be easy either. \u201cThere will be a long line of people waiting for the microphone to denounce it,\u201d Boss predicted before he had heard details of the proposal. \u201cI think there's a good chance nothing will be decided formally.\u201d That prospect dismays those who have been working on the new definition. \u201cThis is a very good compromise,\u201d says Binzel, \u201cand it's time to move forward.\u201d \n                 With additional reporting by Geoff Brumfiel\u00a0Discuss the IAU proposal on what makes a planet \u2014 and propose your own mnemonic for what could be the new 12 planets \u2014 on  \n                 Nature \n                 's newsblog, blogs.nature.com/news/blog. \n               \n                     Possible planets left with no name \n                   \n                     'Tenth Planet' found to be a whopper \n                   \n                     Astronomers reject the term \u2018planet\u2019 \n                   \n                     Astronomers to decide what makes a planet \n                   \n                     International Astronomical Union \n                   \n                     Official newspaper of the IAU General Assembly \n                   \n                     Wikipedia on the Solar System \n                   \n                     Wikipedia definition of a planet \n                   \n                     Michael Brown's planet page \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Florida is on a drive to recruit Californian research institutes, dangling tempting financial offers to persuade renowned laboratories to set up branches in the state. At least three research institutes are jockeying for a share of the $245 million recently allocated to job-creating projects in Florida. The organizations whose leaders are being wined, dined and flown to the state on private jets include the Burnham Institute, a biomedical research facility based in La Jolla, California; SRI International, a non-profit research institute in Menlo Park, known for developing Silicon Valley technologies; and the Torrey Pines Institute for Molecular Studies, also based in La Jolla. The driving force behind the recruitment is Florida Governor Jeb Bush, a Republican and the brother of President George W. Bush. Earlier this year, Governor Bush got $245 million from the Florida legislature to create high-tech industry jobs. He is now using that money to woo research leaders from California, the state apparently most interested in what Florida has to offer. A state legislative committee is scheduled to meet on 17 August to consider proposals on how to divvy up the money. Under Governor Bush's proposals, local governments will partner with a research institute and offer land and buildings worth nearly $100 million. Each partnership will then ask the state to match that investment. A 2003 agreement between Governor Bush, the county of Palm Beach, and the California-based Scripps Research Institute, to build a research complex with the Scripps name, provides a model for how this could work. So far, more than $90 million has been spent on 'Scripps Florida', although no permanent buildings have yet been constructed. Separately, Scripps has launched an initiative to build a leading centre for avian influenza research in Florida. Called Project Checkmate, the plan calls for Scripps to join forces with IBM's Thomas J. Watson Research Center in Yorktown Heights, New York. Researchers from both institutes would use supercomputers and a biosecure laboratory facility to try to predict each year's avian-flu mutations in advance. \u201cBiotechnology combined with large-scale computing could really move both fields forward,\u201d says Ajay Royyuru, head of computational biology at IBM's Watson Center. Project leaders are seeking $520 million over five years from the US National Institutes of Health, as well as $18 million from Florida. Many in Florida support such collaborations, saying they will bring much-needed jobs to the state. But not everyone is happy. \u201cThese are absolutely horrible deals, giving away the store,\u201d says Dan Gelber, a Democratic state representative from Miami Beach. Joseph Cortright, an Oregon-based economist who studies high-tech industries, agrees that pouring money into new facilities doesn't necessarily create better jobs or broad economic benefit to the region. \n               Gold rush \n             Some Florida universities also aren't thrilled. \u201cThe state needs to support research institutions that are already operating,\u201d says Abdul Rao, a vice-president for research at the University of South Florida. To help pay for the transfers, Governor Bush is proposing shifting millions of dollars from state-university budgets. The president of the Burnham Institute, molecular biologist John Reed, says money was the principal reason the Burnham wants to add a Florida facility. In recent years the institute had asked California legislators for additional funding, but without success. Reed wouldn't comment on financial specifics of the deal, but the Burnham reportedly wants about $150 million of the state's money. Expanding into Florida, Reed argues, would raise the Burnham's profile. \u201cI think it is a great advantage, having a presence at the national level,\u201d he says. The institute has narrowed possible locations for its expansion to the Orlando area and to Port St. Lucie on the Atlantic coast. Meanwhile, SRI International has its eye on creating a water-research facility near Tampa, in conjunction with the University of South Florida. Project costs weren't available, and SRI officials declined to comment. As for the Torrey Pines Institute, it plans to partner with governments in either Boca Raton or elsewhere in Palm Beach County and hopes to eventually have 20 principal investigators there. The institute was personally recruited by Governor Bush, says chemist Richard Houghten, its president and founder. \u201cIt's very exciting,\u201d he says. \n                 With additional reporting by Emma Marris \n               \n                     News in brief \n                   \n                     US science policy: Upstart states \n                   \n                     Wildlife campaigners fight planned site for Scripps Florida \n                   \n                     The Burnham Institute \n                   \n                     SRI International \n                   \n                     Torrey Pines Institute for Molecular Studies \n                   \n                     Scripps Research Institute \n                   \n                     Palm Beach Post Scripps Florida archive \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Klimanskaya  et al .  Nature  doi:10.1038/nature05142; 2006 ). The paper attracted worldwide media excitement, particularly in Germany, where the law prevents scientists from working on newly derived human embryonic stem-cell lines. Shares in Lanza's company, Advanced Cell Technologies (ACT) in Worcester, Massachusetts, leapt five-fold in price in just 10 hours. But this was quickly followed by a backlash as it became clear that all 16 of the embryos used in the research had been destroyed. German newspapers, for example, accused Lanza, as well as  Nature , of hyping the results. \u201cSo many things about the paper and how it was presented are unclear,\u201d complains stem-cell scientist Hans Sch\u00f6ler, a director of the Max Planck Institute for Molecular Biomedicine in M\u00fcnster, Germany. Sch\u00f6ler says he is disappointed that such confusion should cloud the field so soon after the Woo Suk Hwang scandal, in which the South Korean scientist falsely claimed to have created embryonic stem-cell lines from cloned human embryos. No one is suggesting that Lanza's paper is in any way scientifically incorrect, but many in the field have objected, like Sch\u00f6ler, to its overall packaging. \u201cPerhaps 'word-smithy' is the right term,\u201d comments George Daley of the Harvard Stem Cell Institute. As well as the comments on the podcast, the paper's abstract also implied that the ACT scientists had created stem-cell lines without destroying embryos, saying: \u201cThe ability to create new stem-cell lines and therapies without destroying embryos would address the ethical concerns of many.\u201d  Nature 's press release also stated that only one cell had been taken from each embryo \u2014 a misconception repeated in subsequent news stories. The paper itself, however, shows only proof of principle that a human embryonic stem-cell line can be created from a single cell, or blastomere, from a very early embryo comprising 8\u201310 cells. None of the embryos used survived. The  Nature  paper's details and Supplementary Information made clear that all the embryos were broken up, stating that 91 cells were used from 16 embryos. Only two stem-cell lines were created, so the efficiency of the process \u2014 barely 2% \u2014 is much lower than it appears to be at first glance. Some feel this caveat was hidden too deeply. Peter Andrews of the University of Sheffield, UK, co-leader of ESTOOLS, the European Union's programme to develop human embryonic stem-cell biology, says that researchers as well as journalists were fooled: \u201cMany scientists at the kick-off meeting of ESTOOLS a couple of days later had quickly read the manuscript and got the impression that Lanza really had extracted just a single cell, and that the embryos survived.\u201d Within minutes of the paper going live,  Nature 's press office corrected its press release to say that Lanza's experiments had destroyed some of the embryos. Two days later, a second note made clear that all the embryos had been destroyed. \u201c Nature  takes responsibility for the problems with the press release, for which I apologize,\u201d says Philip Campbell, editor-in-chief of  Nature . He adds that a clarification has been posted alongside  Nature 's podcast, and that the paper will also be clarified. Lanza says he never intended to say more than that he had proved a principle, and that he is surprised by the reaction to the paper. He adds that the established procedure of pre-implantation genetic diagnosis (PGD), in which a single cell is extracted for genetic analysis, has already shown that embryos from which a blastomere has been removed survive. \u201cWe knew that, so we took multiple cells from each embryo so as not to be wasteful,\u201d he says. The  Nature  paper says Lanza's method will \u201callow the generation of matched tissue for children and siblings born from transferred PGD embryos\u201d, and he now plans to take the work into the clinic. He hopes the methodology will provide a source of stem cells compatible with US law, which prohibits public funding of research into new human embryonic cell lines derived at the expense of embryos. Many stem-cell researchers describe the science in Lanza's paper as interesting, if preliminary. \u201cAnything that you learn about human stem-cell biology, is going to be helpful, whatever way you want to derive new cell lines,\u201d comments Daley. But it is still not clear whether applying this approach to PGD embryos would resolve ethical concerns (see  Nature   442 , 858; 2006). Norio Nakatsuji of Kyoto University, who derived Japan's only human embryonic stem-cell lines, points out that the process poses a small risk to the baby. \u201cWe don't know how this would be legally interpreted,\u201d adds James Battey, chair of the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) Stem Cell Task Force. \u201cThe NIH would need a test case. Scientists in countries where cell lines may be legally derived from embryos discarded from  in vitro  fertilization procedures, such as Britain, Sweden and Japan, also object to the idea of carrying out research just to get round political restrictions. \u201cIt is more ethical to work on embryos that are going to be destroyed anyway,\u201d says Andrews. \u201cIf you do science for the purpose of getting around the law it makes things worse; it makes science look dishonest.\u201d \n                     A long week in stem-cell politics... \n                   \n                     Human eggs supply 'ethical' stem cells \n                   \n                     Biologists forced to reassess embryo test \n                   \n                     Rebooted cells tackle ethical concerns \n                   \n                     'Ethical' routes to stem cells highlight political divide \n                   \n                     Altered embryos offered as solution to stem-cell rift \n                   \n                     Making stem cells web focus \n                   \n                     Stem cells in focus \n                   \n                     Stem cells insight \n                   \n                     Stem cells podcast \n                   \n                     25 years of embryonic stem cells \n                   \n                     Advanced Cell Technology \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

Genome studies are turning up exciting hints about what makes human brains unique. But scientists must now tackle a difficult question: how can they tell which leads point in the right direction and which are red herrings? The new studies rely on genome sequence data from humans' closest relatives: other primates. A draft of the chimpanzee genome was released last year 1  and a draft sequence of the macaque genome is also publicly available. The data are enabling scientists to compare chimp, human and monkey DNA to search out signals that seem unique to people. This approach is yielding pointers to the mechanisms that may have driven human evolution. Last week, researchers led by James Sikela of the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center in Aurora, announced the latest 2 . They looked for genes repeated more often in human DNA than in chimp genomes. They found that one gene contains a protein-coding domain that is repeated 212 times in people, compared with 37 repeats in chimps, 30 in macaques and one in mice and rats. And, significantly, this protein domain is present in human brain cells. It is also present in other tissues, but Sikela's team is excited because the domain is found in the neocortex, which is much larger in humans than in other primates. \u201cThe fact that a huge explosion of this domain occurred in the primate lineages, and the fact that it is found in the brain, seems to make it a good candidate for cognitive function,\u201d says Sikela. Investigating such 'copy-number polymorphisms' \u2014 gene repeats, deletions and other large-scale rearrangements \u2014 is one of the hottest areas of genomic research, says geneticist Evan Eichler of the University of Washington in Seattle. These sorts of structural variants have only recently been discovered, and it's possible that they could be a major driver of human evolution 3 . \u201cOne take-home message here is that duplications rock, and structural variation is very important,\u201d Eichler says. A broader question raised by Sikela's work and other recent studies is how to find out what, exactly, the newly discovered genes are doing. The easiest way to pin down an unknown gene's function \u2014 mutating it in an individual \u2014 isn't ethically acceptable in chimps or, of course, people. One solution, says Sikela would be to mutate the relevant genes in mice, to see what happens to the rodents' brains. In a 2002 study, researchers at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, Massachusetts, found that they could enlarge mouse brains by inducing fetal mice to over-express the regulatory chemical \u03b2-catenin 4 . That suggested the chemical might regulate pathways that control human brain size. Researchers can also scan tissue banks to find out when in human development genes are expressed. In a paper published on 16 August 5 , a team led by David Haussler at the University of California, Santa Cruz, did just that. By comparing the human and chimp genomes, they found one gene that has evolved rapidly during the transition from chimps to people. They looked at embryonic tissue collected by collaborators in Belgium, and found that this gene is expressed at 7\u201319 weeks of human development, when neurons are known to be forming and moving throughout the brain. Another way to work out what brain genes do is to look for effects on human health, and to study patients with brain dysfunctions. In a study published on 13 August in  Nature Genetics 6 , Eichler's lab looked at duplications in the genomes of 290 patients with unexplained mental retardation. One patient had a deletion in the same region of the genome where Sikela's group found its new gene. \u201cIt doesn't prove anything, but it's interesting,\u201d Eichler says. Finding the function of highly repetitive genes is especially challenging, he adds, because such genes are tricky to analyse correctly, and genome assemblers often miss them. So there are large gaps in our understanding of where duplications occur. Eichler is trying to remedy this with a project to sequence all the structural variations in a small group of people. Other investigators say that it will be hard to make better sense of the new genome studies without more studies on apes. Because chimps are difficult to work with, and scarce, researchers don't really know much about how the structure and function of chimp brains compare with those of human brains, says Todd Preuss, a neuroscientist at the Yerkes National Primate Research Center in Atlanta, Georgia. That makes it hard to decipher the meaning of genetic disparities in the two species' brains, and that must change, he says. \u201cWe're all dressed up with no place to go \u2014 we've got all this wonderful information and we can't do much with it. The way to get around this is to study apes, and to start looking at the differences between human and chimp brain organization.\u201d \n                     Multiple copies of a mystery gene may make us human \n                   \n                     Homing in on the genes for humanity \n                   \n                     Human genome: Patchwork people \n                   \n                     Chimp genome web focus \n                   \n                     Chimp genome news special \n                   \n                     Rhesus monkey genome project \n                   \n                     NHGRI: Genome sequencing proposals \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

We want to do accurate and honest scientific work under the premise that God has created the world. Scientific naturalism as we know it doesn't allow for a creator who can interfere with the physical world. Evolution should be taught in schools, and creation discussed along with it. \n               How would you describe your relationship with scientists? \n             You don't have to agree on everything to do good, accurate science together with [non-creationist] scientists. We use the same methods as other scientists, namely falsifying and verifying hypotheses. We don't want to put anyone down. We would very much like to have an open discussion with evolutionary biologists about the issues at stake. But we feel constantly misunderstood. Scientists \u2014 and the media \u2014 always say we are dilettantes, Christian fundamentalists. This is mean. 'Fundamentalism' is immediately associated with Islamic fundamentalism: read terrorism. Fighting against these prejudices is extremely hard. \n               What about evolution? \n             Microevolution, the adaptation of species to their environment, is an observed scientific fact, which we of course do not deny.But macroevolution, the gradual process of development of new species, is a mere conclusion, there's no observational evidence for that. \n               How would you compare your group with creationists in the United States? \n             We are aware of other creationist groups in Europe and the United States. But we don't collaborate too much with any of them. The US debate is more aggressive, there is more foul play from both sides. This is not helpful. \n               Do you advocate intelligent design? \n             There's an open question about how the many complex structures observed in the Universe came into being. Intelligent design gives an alternative answer to this question. We can subscribe to most of its arguments. Reprints and Permissions"},

Planetary scientists are eager to step up their search for life on Mars after news that liquid water seems to have flowed down gullies (pictured right) in the planet's mid-latitudes within the past few years. Mike Malin of Malin Space Science Systems in San Diego, California, and his team saw gullies forming on two crater walls on Mars between 1999 and 2005. The light colour of the gullies and their characteristic shape have convinced Malin that they were carved by flowing water (M. C. Malin  et al .  Science   314 , 1573\u20131577; 2006). Gamma-ray observations show that plenty of ice is present on and beneath the surface of Mars. But with an average surface temperature of \u221263\u00b0C and an atmospheric pressure of less than 1% of Earth's, significant amounts of liquid water have been considered unlikely, to say the least. Malin is not suggesting that there are lush lakes, or waterfalls flowing down the red planet's cratered surfaces. More likely are brief spurts of rapidly evaporating water that push a mudflow down a slope. Malin's peers are taking the news seriously. \u201cThese results are certainly impacting our science objectives,\u201d says Jennifer Heldmann, a geomorphologist at NASA's Ames Research Center in Moffett Field, California. In 2005, Heldmann suggested that gullies on Mars could be caused by water flowing under current martian conditions (J. L. Heldmann  et al .  J. Geophys. Res.   110 , EO5004; 2005). Since Malin announced his results, Heldmann has arrived in the Utah desert, an area thought to have similar geomorphology to that on Mars. Heldmann will be visiting several sites in the desert over the next two weeks to work out more about the formation mechanism of gullies there, and relate this to the Mars results. \u201cWe're trying to tie together the gully observations with the formation mechanism,\u201d she says, \u201cexactly what we are also trying to do on Mars.\u201d HiRISE, the High-Resolution Space Imaging Experiment that is onboard the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO), will also be following up Malin's results. Alfred McEwen, principal investigator for HiRISE, says that the instrument will take images of the gullies identified in Malin's paper several times over the next few years. It's very unlikely that flowing water will be seen in action. If there, it probably flows very rarely, and for only a few hours in small, isolated spots. Malin's back-of-an-envelope calculation suggests that HiRISE has a tiny 1-in-10 21  chance of seeing water flow. But HiRISE might be able to shed more light on exactly how the gullies are formed. McEwen accepts water flow as a reasonable hypothesis, but argues that other mechanisms, such as dust deposits, can't be ruled out. (Malin counters that dust slides appear as dark, not light, patches.) The MRO also has a spectrometer on board \u2014 the Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer for Mars, or CRISM \u2014 which could detect the salts or frost that Malin believes are causing the light tone in the images. But the only way to find out for sure is to land on Mars and go to the gullies. Landing on or near the bumpy craters, however, would require pinpoint expertise. Matt Golombeck, landing-site scientist of the Mars exploration programme, says that none of the landers being considered at the moment has that capability. \u201cIt's not clear in the immediate frame how we're going to respond to [Malin's] discovery,\u201d he says. The European Space Agency is also unlikely to change its immediate plans. Its next Mars mission, called ExoMars and headed by Jorge Vago, is scheduled to launch in 2013. It aims to land in a flat area and drill into the rock to look for organic matter, among other things. Attempting to land near the gullies would escalate costs enormously. But NASA has recently called for proposals for a scout mission to Mars. Malin has proposed a rover to land on plains near the crater, then drive down into the gullies. And avid Mars-watcher Phil Christensen from Arizona State University in Tempe has suggested a mission that would crash-land into ice-rich areas of the red planet's mid-latitudes and fly a craft overhead to monitor any debris. Christensen is convinced that the gullies were formed by water. But he disagrees strongly about its source. Although Malin thinks that the water is coming from underground aquifers, Christensen says any underground water would have leaked out and evaporated millions of years ago. That's a puzzle that Malin has yet to solve. He has several arguments for why some of the water below the surface might be liquid: salts might have lowered its melting point, or the subsurface of Mars may be warmer than previously thought. But it's unclear where the water is coming from. Malin speculates that it comes from melting surface ice or that it has existed in the planet's deep interior since Mars formed. Christensen favours a model in which packets of surface snow melt when the climate warms. Other experts are divided. McEwen suspects both Christensen and Malin are right, whereas Vago is not so sure whether Mars has the right conditions to keep underground water liquid. Either way, the finding that groundwater is seeping out of Mars is hugely significant for those who hope one day to find life on the planet. Liquid water is essential for life \u2014 at least for anything like life on Earth. And if life does exist on Mars, the only place it is likely to be able to survive is underground, and that is out of reach of our probes. If liquid water from aquifers is making it to the surface, it might carry microorganisms with it \u2014 although once there, they are unlikely to survive more than a few seconds. \u201cIt means that in the search for life, water is accessible and at the surface,\u201d says McEwen. Malin points out that, so far, there is no evidence of biological activity on Mars. But he adds: \u201cOur results certainly point to a place where biological activity might occur.\u201d \n                     Water could be flowing on Mars today \n                   \n                     Goodbye Mars Global Surveyor \n                   \n                     Mars not so wet after all? \n                   \n                     Radar exposes buried ice on Mars \n                   \n                     Mars may have a frozen sea \n                   \n                     Mars exploration: It's not rover yet web focus \n                   \n                     Mars Global Surveyor \n                   \n                     Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter \n                   \n                     ESA ExoMars mission \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

NASA is breathing another sigh of relief after an apparently successful shuttle lift-off on the evening of 9 December. As  Nature  went to press, NASA officials were still checking Discovery's heat shield for any damage, but the night launch, the first since the 2003 Columbia disaster, seems to have passed without incident. \u201cSo far, so good,\u201d was the assessment of flight director Tony Ceccacci. Small pieces of foam debris and ice fell off the shuttle's external fuel tank during the launch, but this was expected and they did not appear to strike the shuttle. The night-time launch meant that NASA officials were unable to capture on-board video images with as much detail as they had on previous launches. The team is still investigating four 'low momentum' readings from the leading edges of the craft's wings, although they are confident that these are not evidence of debris strikes. On 11 December, Discovery docked with the International Space Station, where it is delivering a new crew member, Sunita Williams, and an $11-million extension to the station's solar-power system.

Munich A German court has revoked a patent on a method for generating a class of human embryonic stem cells. The 5 December ruling is seen as yet another setback for stem-cell research in a nation where it is already constrained by tight regulation. The federal patent court in Munich heard a charge brought by Greenpeace that the patent, held by University of Bonn neurobiologist Oliver Br\u00fcstle on a way to generate precursor nerve cells, was 'contrary to public order'. The environmental group argued that the derivation of the cell lines in question had involved the destruction of human embryos, which breaches guidelines issued by the German Patent Office. The judge, Eva-Maria Schermer, quickly ruled in Greenpeace's favour \u2014 much to the dismay of Br\u00fcstle, who arrived in court with three bodyguards to protect him. The ruling will become binding in a few weeks. It was made in the wake of a public call by Germany's largest research agency, the DFG, for a relaxation of stem-cell laws, which are stricter than those of many other European countries (see  Nature   444 , 253; 2006). Br\u00fcstle says he will now appeal to the Supreme Court in Karlsruhe, arguing that the ruling goes beyond German law, which allows the use of human embryonic stem-cell lines created before 2002. Just last year, the ministry of research awarded Br\u00fcstle a grant for work with human embryonic stem cells derived before 2002. He points out that the ministry stipulates that its grantees should attempt to patent inventions from projects that it supports. But a ruling by the Supreme Court in Karlsruhe could take years. \u201cIn the meantime, it is very hard on me and my family,\u201d Brustle says, \u201cparticularly for kids whose father has been accused of doing things so bad they are considered to be against public order.\u201d \n                     German stem-cell law under fire \n                   \n                     Opponents of stem-cell patent win restrictions \n                   \n                     Making stem cells web focus \n                   \n                     Stem Cells in focus \n                   \n                     Stem cells insight \n                   \n                     Stem cells podcast \n                   \n                     25 years of embryonic stem cells \n                   \n                     Institute of Reconstructive Neurobiology \n                   \n                     German Patent and Trademark Office \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},
