In biology, mathematical systems analysis was until recently nearly invisible in the dazzling light of twentieth-century discoveries. But it has emerged from the shadows in the field of systems biology, a subject buoyed by immense data sets, conveyed by heavy computing power, and addressing seemingly incomprehensible forms of complexity. If systems biology has heroes, one of them is Reinhart Heinrich, a former professor at the Humboldt University in Berlin, who died on 23 October, aged 60. His most famous accomplishment was metabolic control theory, published in 1974 with Tom Rapoport and formulated independently by Henrik Kacser and James A. Burns in Edinburgh, UK. From the 1930s to the 1960s, biochemists were busy describing metabolic pathways, just as molecular biologists today are feverishly trying to inventory the cell's gene-transcription and signalling circuits. The basic kinetic features of the enzymes in the major pathways were studied in great detail and with exceeding care. It seemed self-evident that, knowing the properties of each element, the behaviour of a pathway  in vivo  could simply be understood as the sum of its enzymes. One assertion, drilled into the head of every biochemist, was the concept of the rate-limiting step. In this view, the flux through a pathway was determined by the slowest reaction, in the way a bucket brigade fighting a fire would be limited by the speed of the slowest member. Yet this concept, as shown by the metabolic control theory, was theoretically flawed, practically incomplete and often wrong, as many efforts to genetically engineer enzymes by changing 'rate-limiting steps' would ultimately show. Metabolic control theory introduced the concept of control coefficients \u2014 dimensionless quantities indicating how the flux of a pathway depended on a given step. Only a pathway where every control coefficient except one was zero would have a rate-limiting step, since the flux of that pathway would depend only on that step. Several pathways in fact had rate-limiting steps, but that often reflected the structure of the pathway, and could not simply be deduced from the maximum rates of the individual enzymes, their Michaelis constants or their displacement from equilibrium. Many pathways were instead networks, with the fluxes distributed in a self-governing way among its various branches. Heinrich went on to apply this theory to the real case of glycolysis in red blood cells, where he showed that the flux of the reaction was shared by several enzymes. Much later, he extended his ideas to signal-transduction pathways, introducing control coefficients to dynamic processes. Sticking to real examples, such as the Wnt signalling and MAP kinase pathways, he again demonstrated that new properties and constraints emerge when the individual steps are combined into a complete pathway. Heinrich also pointed the way to considerations of optimality theory and evolution that will confront systems biology for the next century. The question of evolution lies just beneath any effort to understand biology. Yet in most cases, physiological function and evolutionary change are considered distinct and are investigated by different people. Heinrich's work illustrated how systems biology might develop, where the central question will be not only how a system works, but why it has the specific design it has. In examining optimization for metabolic pathways, he found that there is no unique solution for the individual rate constants and affinities, but many solutions that are each optimized with respect to certain conditions. By considering the criteria for optimization, such as pathway flux or minimization of enzyme concentration, he nevertheless found general tendencies, such as a match between the Michaelis constant and substrate concentration. Evolutionary optimization is becoming a central feature in systems biology. Some of the wrenching political developments of the twentieth century framed Heinrich's life, and it is a tribute to the collegiality of science that his reputation and influence were able to transcend such considerations. He was born in Dresden, but spent his early years in Kuibishev, Russia. His father, a professor of applied mathematics, belonged to the group of scientists in East Germany who, after the Second World War, were rounded up by the Russians to help build their aviation industry. The family returned to East Germany in the early 1950s, and Heinrich studied solid-state physics in Dresden. But after his PhD he became interested in applying physics to biology, and moved to East Berlin to join the group of Samuel Rapoport \u2014 a family connection that later continued when he worked with the son, Tom. Rapoport senior was a biochemist who himself was a refugee (in this case from anti-communist hysteria in the United States). In East Berlin, travel and outside communication were severely restricted, but Heinrich partly coped with the isolation by organizing meetings in East Germany. When the Berlin Wall fell, his fame began to spread more rapidly, increasing as systems biology has taken off as an organized discipline over the past few years. Reinhart Heinrich's character is revealed both in his originality in seeking rational explanations in biology and in his approach to life in general. He published a prizewinning philosophical novel ( Jenseits von Babel  [ Beyond Babel ]) and a book of poems. He played the violin and was well versed in history and literature; he also had an amazing ability to remember what he had done on every day of his life. His humour and charm were contagious. He trained a whole generation of students, becoming the father of the Berlin school of theoretical biophysics, and led us to the edge of a new domain of knowledge. Reinhart died too young. But he was fortunate enough to have glimpsed the future outlines and promise of systems biology, a field he himself was instrumental in founding. Reprints and Permissions"},

Moore"}], "parsed_as_year": "2006_or_before", "body": "Gold, frankincense and myrrh \u2014 the three royal gifts of the Christmas story \u2014 remain valuable commodities. But as Toon Rijkers  et al . report in the  Journal of Applied Ecology  ( 43,  1188\u20131195; 2006), the latter-day story of frankincense is also a tale for our times. Frankincense is a resin produced by several small trees of the genus  Boswellia , which grow in sub-Saharan Africa, from Nigeria to the Horn of Africa, and Arabia and the Himalayan foothills. The resin is exuded naturally from leaves and shoots, but especially from wounds. Its natural function is probably to ward off grazers and fungal attack. But the resin's fragrance has also made it prized as a perfume, fumigant, flavouring and medicinal compound. Rijkers  et al . looked at frankincense production in Eritrea, where it is used locally for cultural and medicinal purposes, and is also exported. Wild  Boswellia papyrifera  trees are tapped by making incisions around the trunk of the tree, starting in mid-September at the end of the summer monsoon. The resin is harvested every three weeks by reopening the incisions, and harvesting continues throughout the dry season.  Boswellia  trees also produce their flower buds at the end of the wet season, however. Could the constant harvest of resin, commencing at the time of floral induction, be a serious drain on the trees' carbon resources? Not least because leaves are lost at the beginning of the dry season, so carbon for flowering and resin production must be obtained from storage products. To investigate the effects of resin-tapping on the tree life-cycle, and especially seed quality, Rijkers  et al . checked the seed-germination potential of tapped and untapped trees. They found that seeds from annually tapped trees had a germination success of only about 20% compared with a figure of 80\u201390% for untapped trees. Tapped trees also produced fewer inflorescences, fruits and seeds. So tapping is evidently costly to the individual tree. There has been a severe reduction in the natural regeneration of  Boswellia  in Eritrea, to which more intense tapping may be contributing. Actions that would help to reverse this trend include reducing the amount of resin taken per tree, and resting selected trees for a few seasons; the  Boswellia  populations also need protection from intense grazing. Here, however, the spectre of the 'Tragedy of the Commons' arises: the resources for both frankincense harvesting and grazing are freely available, and so prone to overexploitation unless the common good is taken into account. Self-regulation in the cause of long-term sustainability is a difficult lesson to learn, as a wider world has found out from the over-exploitation of fisheries. Reprints and Permissions"},

Yet in many sensitive applications, the unique directness of human touch is highly desirable. Now Graeme Whyte  et al . introduce an apparatus that could go some way to putting the 'hand' back in manipulation, even on very small scales ( Opt. Express   14 , 12497\u201312502; 2006). The authors' apparatus marries the skill of human digits with the laser-sharp precision of 'optical tweezers'. Such tweezers use the momentum of a highly focused laser beam to trap and move objects as small as a single atom. The technique is increasingly useful, especially in cell biology, where it can be applied to measuring the mechanical, optical and transport properties of cells and biological molecules without the need for a material probe. Whyte  et al . use 'holographic' optical tweezers, in which a diffractive element, known as a spatial light modulator, is used to steer the laser beam. This allows several optical traps to be created that can be moved independently in three dimensions. The authors hook up the spatial modulator to a camera that images the position of beads attached to the fingertips of two gloved human hands. A specially written hologram-calculation algorithm converts the positions of the beads in the photographic plane into the  x \u2013 y  position of the optical traps, and the apparent size of the bead in the image into a  z -coordinate. The result is a device in which each trapping beam acts as a digit of an optically controlled hand. The position of this hand on the micrometre scale is controlled by appropriate larger-scale movements of the remote, real hands. The images show how silica beads trapped at the tips of the optical fingers grasp and move a larger, irregularly shaped chrome bead. The hologram algorithm allows 8 frames per second \u2014 enough for manipulation in real time \u2014 to be processed using a standard desktop computer. Because the manipulated object does not itself have to be optically trapped, this method could be very useful for dealing with light-scattering metallic particles or light-sensitive materials, such as some biological tissues. But more generally, such techniques could mean that the future of micromanipulation lies in our hands. Reprints and Permissions"},

In its latest role, it serves as a self-assembling scaffold to arrange different metal ions in a row, like pearls on a string. The days when DNA was the exclusive purview of molecular biologists are over. Since the discovery of DNA's double-helix structure in 1953, numerous disciplines have embraced this biomolecule \u2014 from medicine to materials science, by way of classical chemistry and biotechnology. Reporting in  Nature Nanotechnology , Tanaka  et al . 1  describe an application of DNA that clearly stems from inorganic chemistry: they have modified DNA so that it serves as a scaffold for one-dimensional arrays of metal ions. Each array is a combination of copper and mercury ions, arranged in an order defined by the DNA sequence. Such precise control over the assembly of these arrays would be necessary for their potential applications as nanomagnets 2 , as self-assembling molecular wires or as catalysts in chemical reactions. Single strands of DNA comprise a sugar\u2013phosphate chain decorated with organic bases. A natural DNA double helix consists of two single strands, with the sugar\u2013phosphate backbones on the outside and the bases on the inside ( Fig. 1a ). Each base forms hydrogen bonds with just one other kind of base \u2014 a complementary base \u2014 on the opposite strand. It is the complementarity of these bases that drives the reliable self-assembly process of double-helix formation. Tanaka  et al . 1  replaced the natural bases of DNA with artificial ones. Each of these substitute bases has a high affinity for a particular metal ion \u2014 either a copper ion (Cu 2+ ) or a mercury ion (Hg 2+ ). The modified DNA can form a double helix only if the opposing bases have a preference for the same metal ion and if both bases bind to such an ion. Given an appropriate base sequence, a duplex can form that contains one or more metal ions along its central axis ( Fig. 1b ). The incorporation of metal ions into an artificial DNA duplex has previously been reported, but with only one kind of metal at a time, typically in systems with a few modified base pairs interspersed between longer rows of natural ones 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 . What is remarkable about Tanaka and colleagues' work 1  is the formation of double helices containing long stretches of two different metal ions. Not only did the authors selectively incorporate more than one kind of metal ion into artificial DNA, but they also used more than one kind of artificial base, in various sequences. This is a tremendous advance towards the goal of making metal-containing, self-assembling nanomaterials with desirable properties that can be tuned on the basis of the order of the metal ions. The beauty of Tanaka and colleagues' work is that it exploits the self-assembly of DNA, where the two strands come together, a process that has been optimized by evolution over several billion years. Furthermore, automated DNA synthesis permits quick and easy access to any desired sequence of artificial DNA, provided that a certain length of molecule is not exceeded. So how could these artificial DNA structures be used? One possible application is in organic chemistry, as catalysts for enantioselective reactions 9  \u2014 that is, reactions that proceed with precise control of the three-dimensional structure of the products. Such catalysts are essential for the synthesis of biologically active compounds, but tailoring the interactions between a catalyst and a reactant to achieve this precise control is far from simple. Natural catalysts, such as enzymes, are excellent at directing enantioselective reactions, but from a chemist's perspective their range of reaction conditions is very restricted. Synthetic metal catalysts can be optimized to work under more typical laboratory conditions and on an industrial scale, but they are often less efficient than enzymes. Metal-ion-containing DNA catalysts represent a biologically inspired approach that could combine the best of both of these catalytic worlds. It has been found that, in a short artificial DNA duplex containing an array of five consecutive copper ions, the ions interact magnetically with each other 2 ; this helix can be thought of as a self-assembled nanomagnet. Using Tanaka and colleagues' approach 1 , specific combinations of metal ions might be incorporated into DNA to fine-tune the magnetic properties of such devices. The electrical properties of DNA are also of interest. Unmodified DNA lacks sufficient electrical conductivity to be used in molecular electronic devices 10 . To address this problem, DNA has previously been prepared with metals attached to its exterior, but this modification prevented the DNA from reversibly self-assembling 11 . Tanaka and colleagues' structures 1  might provide a way forward, as they incorporate metal ions in the centre of a DNA double helix that retains its ability to self-assemble. But difficulties might be encountered when scaling up the authors' technique to build larger molecules. As DNA duplexes form, intermediate double helices can be produced in which the bases are not perfectly matched. But every metal ion incorporated into the artificial DNA increases the stability of the final aggregate. This effect could stabilize the intermediate helices so much that they no longer rearrange to form a perfect duplex, so introducing errors during DNA self-assembly. Perhaps more importantly, automated DNA synthesis can only prepare sequences of up to about 100 bases. To build larger structures, biological techniques must be developed that either splice together short artificial DNA strands or allow the synthesis of longer strands. Such methods exist for natural DNA, but these would have to be modified to tolerate artificial bases and metal ions. Finally, more work is needed to determine the electrical properties of metal-ion-containing DNA \u2014 is it a conductor or a semiconductor? Future research should focus on this question, and investigate the factors that influence conductivity. It seems that the quest for a functioning molecular device based on metal-ion-modified DNA is about to begin. Reprints and Permissions"},

There is no question that there is a sound basis for the prescribing of low-salt diets in many diseases, particularly those involving the circulatory system. When it comes to normal people, however, recommendations are infinitely more difficult. It is certainly true that the chemistry of the body does not require the addition of salt to our food.

Lee"}], "parsed_as_year": "2006_or_before", "body": "How do voltage-gated ion channels in cell membranes open? The latest work suggests that the process depends on having the correct lipid molecules in the membrane, with phosphate groups being mandatory. Electrical signalling in the nervous system involves voltage-gated ion channels, proteins that sit in the outer membrane of nerve cells. This membrane, like all membranes, consists of lipid molecules that are organized in the form of a bilayer \u2014 the charged parts of the molecules, the lipid headgroups, lie on the outside of the bilayer in contact with water, with the fatty acyl chains of the lipid molecules occupying the centre and forming the oily core. Embedded in this lipid bilayer are the voltage-gated ion channels. On  page 775  of this issue, Schmidt, Jiang and MacKinnon 1  show that having the correct lipids in the membrane is essential if the ion channels are to open when the voltage changes across the membrane Footnote  1 . The voltage change that opens an ion channel \u2014 about 50 mV \u2014 seems quite small, but a voltage change of 50 mV across a membrane 50 \u00c5 thick corresponds to a change of about 100,000 V cm \u22121 , easily enough to cause a change in the structure of an ion channel. Our views of what exactly this structural change might be altered dramatically when MacKinnon's group determined the X-ray structure of a voltage-gated ion channel 2 , 3 . The part of the ion channel that senses the change in voltage across the membrane is highly positively charged and is loosely attached to the outer face of the channel, exposed to the lipid bilayer. Because of its shape, MacKinnon referred to this part of the channel as a paddle ( Fig. 1 ). The idea is that a change in voltage across the membrane results in movement of the paddle, which in turn leads to opening of the central pore of the channel, allowing ions to flow through the pore. It is currently a matter of debate whether the paddle moves all the way across the lipid bilayer when the voltage changes or whether its motion is more restricted 4 . It seems likely that a bilayer of the correct lipid composition is essential for proper function of the paddle, because the paddle is exposed to the bilayer and has to move in it. The idea that the lipids are important has now been investigated by MacKinnon and colleagues 1  in a very direct way. They used the traditional approach of forming lipid-bilayer membranes across a small hole in a plastic partition, and then inserting a voltage-gated ion channel into the membrane by fusing vesicles containing the purified channel with the membrane. This allowed them to measure the current flowing through the ion channel as a function of the lipid composition of the membrane. For their experiments, they used the voltage-gated potassium channel from the bacterium  Aeropyrum pernix  because this can be expressed in high quantities in  Escherichia coli  and then purified. The lipid composition chosen by MacKinnon and colleagues 1  for their initial experiments was 70% phosphatidylethanolamine and 30% phosphatidylglycerol. This is the lipid composition of  E. coli  cell membranes, and the ion channel behaved perfectly in a bilayer of these lipids. But what happens when the lipid composition is changed? The authors looked at the importance of phosphatidylethanolamine. Although this is the most abundant lipid in the  E. coli  membrane, it is rather unusual in that it does not, on its own, form bilayers at normal temperatures. Rather, because the overall shape of the molecule is conical, it tends to pack in three dimensions to give curved, non-bilayer structures. However, the presence in the membrane of a cylindrically shaped lipid molecule such as phosphatidylglycerol forces the phosphatidylethanolamine to adopt a bilayer structure, with the latter molecules being said to exist in the bilayer in a state of 'curvature frustration'. There has been much speculation as to the possible significance of this frustrated state 5 . However, the authors found that channel function was unaltered when phosphatidylethanolamine was substituted with the cylindrically shaped, bilayer-favouring lipid phosphatidylcholine. So it seems that curvature frustration is not important for ion-channel function. MacKinnon and colleagues then turned to the effect of phosphatidylglycerol, a lipid molecule with a negatively charged (anionic) headgroup. Anionic lipids would be expected to bind strongly to the positively charged paddle; it has been shown 6 , for example, that negatively charged lipids bind with high affinity to a positively charged patch on the mechanosensitive channel MscL. But the voltage-gated potassium channel was functional in the absence of phosphatidylglycerol, soany interaction between anionic lipids and the paddle cannot be essential for channel function. Rather, it turns out that what  is  essential for function is the presence of a negatively charged phosphate group in the lipid molecule. The channel was totally inactive in non-natural, positively or negatively charged lipid molecules lacking a phosphate group, or in an uncharged, sugar-based lipid. It is intriguing that the membrane lipids of  A. pernix , from which the channel originally came, are, unusually, all anionic, phosphate-containing lipids 7 . Why is the phosphate group vital? MacKinnon and colleagues suggest that negatively charged phosphate groups in the lipid molecules may act as counterions for the positively charged arginine amino-acid residues in the paddle, stabilizing the charged paddle in the lipid bilayer. If this idea is correct, it would provide another example of the importance for membrane-protein function of the local interactions between a membrane protein and its surrounding lipid molecules.

Lovett"}], "parsed_as_year": "2006_or_before", "body": "Crystal imperfections known as nitrogen\u2013vacancy defects give some diamonds a characteristic pink colour. Appropriately manipulated, these defects might have rosy prospects as the 'qubits' of a quantum computer. According to materials scientist F. C. Franck, \u201ccrystals are like people; it is only the defects that make them interesting\u201d. Ronald Hanson and colleagues would probably agree: writing in  Physical Review Letters 1 , they report new developments in the study of negatively charged 'nitrogen\u2013vacancy defects' in diamond. These systems are rapidly becoming a front-runner for use as the basic unit of quantum information \u2014 the 'qubit' \u2014 in a solid-state quantum computer. The lattice of carbon atoms that makes up diamond can contain various substitutional impurities, such as nitrogen or boron atoms. These defects give diamonds their colour, and are often called colour centres. Nitrogen\u2013vacancy (NV) defects give diamond a pink hue, and arise when a nitrogen atom replaces a carbon atom at a position in the diamond lattice next to a vacant site. It might seem unlikely that these two defects should sit right next to each other, but if the diamond is heated, vacancies can diffuse through the lattice until they encounter nitrogen atoms. When this happens, the 'random walk' comes to a halt because the configuration of the two adjacent defects is extremely stable. NV centres come in two flavours: electrically neutral (NV 0 ) and negatively charged (NV \u2212 ). Here, we are interested only in the NV \u2212  centres, which have an extra electron that is probably donated by another nitrogen defect. The total number of electrons in an NV \u2212  defect that do not form bonds between neighbouring carbon atoms is six, and these electrons have a ground state with total spin  S  = 1. This spin can have three different orientations, described by a magnetic quantum number  m S  = +1, 0 or \u22121. If the spin tends to take one of these values, it is said to be polarized. A well-defined, 'coherent' spin state can be preserved in the NV \u2212  centre for a long time (more than 50 microseconds, even at room temperature 2 ). The energy difference between the  m S =0 state and the  m S =\u00b11 states is about 12 microelectronvolts. Photons with a microwave frequency of 3 gigahertz have precisely this energy, and can therefore be used to manipulate the spin state of the NV \u2212  centre. To 'read out' the spin state, transitions to much higher energy states are used. These transitions can be induced by shining a laser on the diamond. The light that is emitted when the NV \u2212  centre relaxes back to the lower energy levels tells us what the spin state was. This process is called photoluminescence 3 . The NV \u2212  spins give us much of what we need for a practical qubit \u2014 long coherence times and precise external control \u2014 and have been widely studied in the context of quantum computing 4 . But considerable obstacles must be overcome before effective quantum computing with NV \u2212  is possible. Perhaps the toughest of these is scaling the system up to many qubits. Hanson  et al . 1  take a significant step towards solving this problem. They demonstrate a coupling between an NV \u2212  centre and a substitutional nitrogen centre, N, with no associated vacancy (this is not the same nitrogen defect that supplies the NV \u2212  with its extra electron). This 'N centre' also has a spin, but with different magnetic quantum numbers:  m S =\u00b11/2. When a magnetic field is applied, the energy-level structure of both the NV \u2212  and N spins changes, a phenomenon known as the Zeeman effect. At certain values of the field, the energy gaps between the spin levels in the two defects become equal. If there is an interaction between NV \u2212  and N, this 'resonance' allows the two defects to exchange energy and polarization through a so-called virtual photon ( Fig. 1 ). This reduces the photoluminescence signal because the NV \u2212  is no longer in the correct quantum state to emit light. It is this effect that Hanson  et al . observe 1 . In a further experiment, the authors bring a microwave field into resonance with the NV \u2212  defect. This too leads to an exchange of polarization, this time between the NV \u2212  spin and the field. If the NV \u2212  is isolated in the diamond lattice, a single dip should be observed in the photoluminescence signal. But Hanson  et al . see two dips in their signal 1 , again because of the interaction with the N centre. The two possible orientations of the N spin cause different effective magnetic fields at the NV \u2212  centre, and shift the resonance accordingly. Importantly, this shift allows us to read out the spin state of the N centre by simply observing the photoluminescence of the NV \u2212  centre. The same experiment shows that a specific state of the N centre can be prepared on demand. As N centres are very common in samples containing NV \u2212  defects, the interactions described above are a main cause of NV \u2212  qubits losing coherence. Being able to control an N centre is a promising way of reducing this decoherence to an acceptable level. The N\u2013NV \u2212  system can embody two electron-spin qubits, so these experiments represent a significant step towards a larger-scale quantum computer based on the NV \u2212  system. The authors suggest that several NV \u2212  centres could be connected through chains of N defects. This seems to us very ambitious; a better way of achieving a many-qubit register could be to use a form of 'measurement-based' quantum computing 5 , in which quantum correlations are created between qubits before any quantum algorithms are executed. In this context, the N\u2013NV \u2212  system could be ideal for a protocol that creates the required quantum correlations between 'broker' qubits through optical manipulations and subsequently transfers them to 'client' qubits that have longer decoherence times, but no optical transitions 6 . With such a strategy, the future for quantum computing would look rosy indeed. Reprints and Permissions"},

It seems that a molecular pyramid can persuade them to stick around for a little longer. The path from starting materials to products in chemical reactions often involves many steps. Intermediate compounds are the resting stages along this path, but they exist in vanishingly small concentrations and can rarely be observed. The methods used to see them all require isolation of the intermediates \u2014 a sort of quarantine that keeps them from encountering other molecules and so prevents them from continuing along the reaction pathway. Several methods have been developed to enforce this isolation. For example, reaction intermediates in the gas phase at very low pressures can be kept apart long enough for them to be observed by spectroscopy. Alternatively, exotic solvents such as liquid helium droplets or frozen argon matrices can isolate intermediates at temperatures near absolute zero. But the segregation of reaction intermediates at room temperature, in a reactive solvent such as water, is far more difficult. That is just what Dong  et al . 1  have done, as they report in the  Journal of the American Chemical Society . The authors isolated intermediates for a widely used type of reaction that is catalysed by amine compounds. They did this by surrounding the intermediates with a capsule that temporarily protects them from further reaction. The capsule is a tetrahedron-shaped complex of four gallium ions (at the corners) and six organic molecules (along the edges;  Fig. 1 ). This forms spontaneously from its constituent parts and is stable in water; its overall negative charge provides an ideal nanoenvironment for positively charged molecules that can fit inside. The intermediates isolated by Dong  et al . are positively charged iminium ions, which form when amines react with ketone molecules ( Fig. 1 ). The concentration of these intermediates in water is tiny, as they react rapidly with water to regenerate the starting materials. The authors 1  found that merely mixing the reaction components \u2014 capsule, amine and ketone \u2014 in water was enough to generate encapsulated iminium ions in good yields. The yields varied depending on the molecular size of the amines and ketones used, but typically 30\u201390% of the capsules were occupied by iminium ions. The trapped intermediates were detected directly by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. The magnetic environment inside the capsule is unusual because of the many aromatic rings that enclose it. Encapsulated molecules thus show profoundly altered NMR signals compared with free molecules in solution, and so are easily distinguished from their unrestrained counterparts. Given a choice of competing iminium ions with different sizes and shapes, the capsule preferentially traps the ion with the best fit, in a process known as molecular recognition. But although such competition experiments 1  go some way to defining the space inside the capsule, questions still remain. Given the flexibility of the larger iminium ions and the sizeable holes in the capsule's structure, it is impossible to say conclusively how much space there is and what fraction of it is occupied. Moreover, not all iminium ions are stabilized by this capsule, with the shape and size of the amine starting material being particularly limiting. The same researchers have previously used their capsule as a catalyst for a different kind of reaction 2 . In this case, the captured starting material (an enammonium ion) underwent a molecular rearrangement, generating iminium ions. These particular ions were not held tightly by the capsule and so escaped, whereupon they were cleaved by the water solvent to yield two products. This overall process shows some of the essential features of enzymatic catalysis, such as selective recognition of starting materials and rapid product release. Indeed, there are many parallels between the encapsulation technique and enzymatic processes: reversible encapsulation can recognize, amplify 3  and stabilize 4  reactive intermediates and accelerate reactions under mild equilibrium conditions, just as enzyme active sites do. Product release from capsules is often difficult, but even that problem has been overcome in specific reactions 5 . And, like enzymes and other natural receptors, synthetic cavities have been fashioned that create an asymmetric environment; this should allow the recognition and control of molecular asymmetry in reactions, which is essential for preparing compounds that have biological activity. The encapsulation technique also has implications for nanoscience. Capsules with huge cavities 6 , capable of holding eight molecules, have been analysed, and polymeric capsules that self-assemble 7  have been discovered. These represent new ways of arranging molecules and might find applications in information storage. The ability to organize molecules within molecules within molecules is also an exciting prospect for researchers seeking to build materials from the inside out. The reaction of amines with ketones is one of the most useful transformations in an organic chemist's repertoire, so Dong and colleagues' isolation of the elusive iminium intermediates is big news. The authors hope to design and prepare different capsules, so that other fleeting reaction intermediates can be stabilized and studied. It may even be possible to develop chemical reactions that were previously unthinkable in aqueous solution. The future of encapsulation chemistry seems assured. Reprints and Permissions"},

Their results illuminate the early dynamics of Earth's interior and provide fresh insight into the structure and flow of the modern mantle. Many short-lived radioactive elements were created in the events that accompanied the formation of the Solar System. These elements \u2014 or rather, the isotopically distinctive products of their radioactive decay \u2014 provide clues about the processes involved in planetary accretion and development. In the final stages of Earth's formation, differentiation processes distributed its constituent minerals and metals between the core, mantle and crust. This resulted in the separation of radioactive nuclides from the products of their decay, so that isotope compositions of the daughter elements in modern-day minerals attest to the separation of vapour, melts and solid phases in the newborn planet. For example, samarium (Sm) decays to produce neodymium (Nd); both of these elements are found in mantle silicates. Variations of neodymium-isotope abundances in terrestrial rocks are useful for dating melt segregation in the mantle. Most earth scientists are familiar with the decay of  147 Sm into  143 Nd, a process with a half-life of 106 billion years. This decay is used as a chronometer and as a tracer of material exchange between mantle and crust. But with such a long half-life it cannot provide a detailed picture of the dawn of geological times. In contrast, the much shorter half-life of  146 Sm decay to  142 Nd (103 million years) is comparable to the timescale of early planetary processes and so is well suited to investigating the dynamics of newborn Earth. So far, the  146 Sm\u2013 142 Nd chronometer has found its most valuable application in the study of magma oceans \u2014 envelopes of liquid silicate that hug newborn planets. The abundances of  142 Nd in 3.8-billion-year-old rocks from Isua in Greenland are higher than those in chondrite meteorites, which are made from the same raw materials as Earth and the other rocky planets. Samarium and neodymium are 'refractory' elements, which survived the harsh conditions found in the newborn Solar System. Their relative proportions in Earth must therefore be the same as for chondrites. The 'excess' of  142 Nd, compared with chondrites, in the Isua basaltic rocks is evidence of a very early melting event (the formation of magma oceans) that concentrated  142 Nd in certain regions of the newly created mantle 2 , 3 . The modern terrestrial mantle and continental crust also display excesses of  142 Nd compared with chondrites. This geochemical feature can only be explained if the mantle is the solid residue of an ancient slurry. To balance the books, the excess of  142 Nd in these regions must be paired with a deficit in another complementary material that is derived from the liquid part of the slurry. But this  142 Nd-deficient material is conspicuously missing from the geological record. Boyet and Carlson have previously argued 4  that this component probably took the form of a primordial crust, which sank down to the core\u2013mantle boundary very early in Earth's history. The case for a missing reservoir, distinct from the familiar mantle, has also been made based on the abundances of the heavier neodymium isotope  143 Nd in Archaean rocks 5  (which are more than 2.7 billion years old) and of hafnium in oceanic basalts 6 . But the  142 Nd anomalies raise an additional useful point \u2014 that the absent material was segregated in the lower mantle during the first tens of millions of years of Earth's history. The quest for the hidden reservoir commenced with studies on oceanic basalts derived from deep mantle material 7 . But now Boyet and Carlson 1  present high-precision  142 Nd abundance data from carbonatites and diamond-bearing kimberlites \u2014 volcanic rocks that are thought most probably to originate from the deepest parts of the mantle. They report that none of these rocks shows a deviation of  142 Nd abundances from the modern terrestrial value. This suggests that the rocks do not originate from a  142 Nd-deficient reservoir or, at the very least, that the contribution of such deep-seated material is not detectable. The authors 1  review different interpretations of their data. They first examine the possibility that Earth's composition may not be chondritic; this could be true if atomic nuclei weren't created in a uniform distribution throughout the nebula from which the Solar System formed. A recent paper 8  suggests that at least one process of nucleosynthesis in supernovae could lead to uneven isotopic abundances of some elements. But the isotopic distributions of nearly all the elements are the same in other planets, which makes it very difficult to justify non-chondritic abundances of samarium and neodymium for Earth. So, if the neodymium isotope compositions of magmas reflect those of their source mantle, the conclusion from Boyet and Carlson's data is inescapable: some lower-mantle material with a  142 Nd-deficit exists, untapped by deep magmas and separate from the convective flow field of the upper mantle. This  142 Nd-deficient material may be locked up in the so-called D9 layer of the lower mantle, which sits on top of the core\u2013mantle boundary. Or perhaps it resides in a deep reservoir resembling the abyssal layer that is proposed to exist at a depth of about 1,600 kilometres 9 , although this layer has so far evaded detection 10 . Of course, it could simply be that the kimberlites and carbonatites analysed by Boyet and Carlson were contaminated on their way to Earth's surface, masking the modest  142 Nd deficit inherited from their source region 7 . Several models for the structure and dynamics of the mantle have been proposed over the years, including the theory that two separate mantle layers exist, each with its own convection patterns. This theory seemed inconsistent with emerging seismic evidence and went out of favour. But thanks to Boyet and Carlson's studies 1 , layered mantle convection may now be knocking at the back door, as this could explain why deep reservoirs have become segregated from upper mantle regions. The authors have revitalized this fundamental debate \u2014 and the arguments look set to continue for years to come. Reprints and Permissions"},

But as they report in this issue, David Julius and colleagues have identified a common factor in the way that a tarantula spider and a chilli plant defend themselves (J. Siemens  et al.   Nature   444 , 208\u2013212; 2006). The particular tarantula is  Psalmopoeus cambridgei  (pictured), a native of the West Indies. From investigations of the spider's venom, Julius and colleagues have identified new members of the 'inhibitor cysteine knot', or ICK, family of peptide toxins. The newly isolated peptides are dubbed 'vanillotoxins' because of their action on the TRPV1 vanilloid receptor, and they cause pain and inflammation when injected into mice. TRPV1 is a member of the TRP group of cell-membrane ion channels and was first identified through its sensitivity to capsaicin, the red-hot component of chilli peppers. Unlike almost every other ICK peptide, however, vanillotoxins activate rather than inhibit their target \u2014 in this case, TRPV1 channels in sensory neurons. An obvious question is whether the excitatory effect on TRPV1 means that the vanillotoxins have a different mechanism of action from the other ICK peptides. A comparison with ICK peptides that have similar amino-acid sequences \u2014 hanatoxins and heteroscodratoxins, which inhibit voltage-gated potassium channels \u2014 suggests that they don't. For instance, two of the vanillotoxins can also inhibit voltage-gated potassium channels; like hanatoxins and heteroscodratoxins, they impede the channel mechanism so that larger changes in voltage are required for the channel to open. Parenthetically, then, these data lend further support to the idea that TRP channels and voltage-gated potassium channels are structurally related. Reprints and Permissions"},

This trait is obviously essential for optimal vision, but it also means the cornea is a useful experimental system for studying the factors that promote or inhibit the formation of blood vessels (angiogenesis). But why the cornea remains avascular despite the presence of the potent angiogenic factor VEGF-A and the proximity of other highly vascular tissues has remained unclear. In this issue, B. K. Ambati  et al . ( Nature   443 , 993\u2013997; 2006) show that in the cornea a soluble receptor, called sflt-1, traps VEGF-A, stopping it from directing the formation of blood vessels. When the authors blocked expression of sflt-1 using a variety of approaches, they saw an increase in free VEGF-A and in corneal vascularization, demonstrating that sflt-1 maintains corneal avascularity. Blood vessels form spontaneously in the corneas of certain mutant mouse strains, as well as in those of people who suffer from a condition known as aniridia as a result of a similar mutation. Ambati and colleagues show that in all these cases, corneal vascularization is accompanied by a deficiency in the expression of sflt-1. In the mice, injections of sflt-1 reduced the corneal vascularization. The authors surveyed different mammalian species to see whether the close relationship between the presence of sflt-1 and an avascular cornea is evolutionarily conserved. Manatees (pictured) are the only known organism with uniformly vascularized corneas. They compensate for their impaired vision with highly developed sensory bristles that enable them to navigate and locate food. Manatees live primarily in turbid freshwater areas, and corneal vascularization may result from or protect against this environment. Interestingly, no sflt-1 expression was detected in manatee corneas, whereas those of dugongs (which belong to the order Sirenia, like manatees) and of elephants \u2014 the manatee's closest terrestrial relatives \u2014 all produced sflt-1.

The 'nano-SQUID' is made of a square loop of 50-nm-thick aluminium wire, which becomes superconducting at temperatures below 1.2 K. Insulating junctions disrupt the loop in two places, with each junction consisting of a single-walled carbon nanotube. The maximum supercurrent flowing through the loop varies with changes in the magnetic flux (the magnetic field multiplied by the area) passing through the loop. This response is what makes SQUIDs such sensitive magnetometers. The nanotube junctions behave like 'quantum dots', which have discrete electronic energy levels. The alignment of these energy levels with those of the superconducting wire can be controlled by applying a voltage near to either \u2014 or both \u2014 of the nanotube junctions. In this way, the voltage effectively turns the current on (energy levels aligned) and off (misaligned). The two-dimensional colour plot shown on the right indicates the peaks (red) and valleys (blue) in the conductance of the device as the junctions are tuned through their on and off states. So why make a SQUID that has carbon-nanotube junctions? The ultimate goal is to detect changes in direction of the magnetic moment of a single molecule or nanoparticle. This could be achieved by placing the nanoparticle directly on one of the nanotubes, optimizing the magnetic flux passing through the loop and so maximizing the device's sensitivity. Although such a measurement has not yet been made, it is well within the sensitivity of this tiniest of SQUIDs. Reprints and Permissions"},

Computer simulations provide an explanation for the success of this strategy. The highly ordered, three-dimensional arrays of molecules that we know as crystals can form spontaneously from the disordered liquid phase. To speed up the rate of crystal formation, crystal-growers often use 'seeds' \u2014 templates that can kick-start crystallization. A few years ago, experiments on protein crystallization 1  unexpectedly showed that highly disordered, porous particles can be particularly effective in initiating the growth of perfectly ordered crystals. Writing in  Physical Review Letters 2 , Page and Sear now explain why the disorder of porous templates allows them to behave as universal crystallization agents. In many areas of science and technology, it is essential to control crystallization. For example, proteins must first be crystallized if we are to determine their structures from X-ray crystallography; pharmaceutical compounds must be prepared in their optimal crystal forms to maximize their effectiveness; and careful design is needed to make photonic crystals, the periodic arrays of micrometre-sized colloidal particles that should eventually find applications in optical devices. One of the problems facing the crystal-grower is that crystals often don't form from solution, even when that solution is highly concentrated with the compound to be crystallized. The nineteenth-century physicist J. Willard Gibbs first explained this phenomenon by pointing out that, under conditions where large crystals are stable, the microscopic crystallites \u2014 the precursors of bulk crystal formation \u2014 are unstable and should disintegrate. But every crystal must start off small, so this implies that large crystals would never form. Brownian motion comes to the rescue: because of the incessant thermal motion of molecules in solution, small crystallites form and break up continuously, but \u2014 very occasionally \u2014 a crystallite may form that is large enough to continue growing. This process is called crystal nucleation, and the smallest crystallite that can grow to become a bulk crystal is known as the critical nucleus. In many cases of practical interest, the rate of crystal nucleation is vanishingly small. This is often a serious problem in the preparation of protein crystals. One way to speed up crystal nucleation is to seed the solution, using particles that have the same surface structure as the desired crystal. Of course, the best seed is a small crystal of the material that one wishes to crystallize, but clearly such seeds are not available if that material has never been crystallized before. An alternative is to use other seed materials that have the right surface patterns. This approach is quite successful for preparing colloidal crystals 3 , but less so for protein crystals. It was therefore a surprise to find that a variety of proteins will crystallize on seeds of microporous silicon 1 . The characteristics of this seed material are almost the opposite of what one would expect of a good crystallization template: it is sponge-like, with a highly disordered surface full of holes and crevices. The idea of crystallization on such a rough surface is counter-intuitive because, as computer simulations on colloidal crystallization have shown, the curvature of the surface makes nucleation more difficult 4 . Crystals attached to curved surfaces are deformed, and are therefore less stable than crystals on flat surfaces. Even if a stress-free crystal does form on a rounded surface, its surface cannot accur-ately follow the curvature of the substrate; again, this would not favour crystallization. Now, however, Page and Sear 2  suggest an explanation for the unexpected crystallization of proteins on a porous surface. They argue that, among the myriad pores at the seed's surface, there will always be some that have exactly the right shape to accommodate a small crystallite. For instance, for a cubic crystal, such a pore would have a rectangular prism shape. The authors then address the question of what the optimum pore size is for crystal nucleation. The answer is not simple. They consider a highly simplified model in which the width of the pore is easily varied, and find that crystal nucleation proceeds in two stages: first, crystallization starts at the corners of the pore; then, once a crystal has grown to fill the pore, it breaks out to form a bulk crystal ( Fig. 1 ). The rate at which crystals form inside the pore increases as the pore becomes narrower. But the rate at which these crystals go on to form a bulk crystal increases as the pore diameter widens. So, for narrow pores, the breakout time is rate limiting, but for wide pores, nucleation is the slowest step. The crystallization rate is at a maximum for pore diameters somewhere between the wide and narrow extremes, and it is these optimally sized pores that dominate crystal nucleation on a microporous substrate. The great diversity of pore sizes and shapes in a microporous material increases the likelihood of an optimal pore existing on the surface of that material. In this sense, a microporous material acts as a huge, random 'library' of crystallization agents. Understanding the microscopic mechanism behind the success of microporous nucleation agents should help us to design seeds with increased crystallizing power. This can be of considerable practical importance, as the production of high-quality protein crystals is one of the main bottlenecks in the X-ray determination of the structure of water-soluble proteins. Unfortunately, it seems unlikely that microporous seeds will help in crystallizing membrane proteins, which constitute about a third of all proteins. Microporous materials should be particularly useful as seed substrates for protein crystallization where the aim is to make only a few crystals. Although the vast majority of pores are ineffective, this doesn't matter as long as a few work well. By analogy, we should expect that a great multitude of random substrates \u2014 or, more generally, highly diverse environments \u2014 are necessary to bring about pro-cesses where just one successful event is enough. The evolution of life may be a case in point. Reprints and Permissions"},

The structures of two such transporters reveal novel aspects of their mechanisms. Living organisms are constantly assailed by a host of harmful chemicals from the environment. Because of the diversity of these 'xenobiotics', cellular survival mechanisms must deal with an immense variety of molecules. Multidrug transporters (MDTs) supply one such strategy. These ubiquitous membrane proteins recognize a wide array of compounds and remove them from the cell in an energy-dependent manner. As a consequence, the concentration of the offending compound is lowered within the cell, so the compound loses its effectiveness against its cellular target and the cell becomes resistant to it. Such a survival strategy for the individual organism may pose serious problems for the treatment of infectious disease or cancer with drugs. MDTs have evolved into many different forms to act on a wide range of xenobiotics. The structures of two MDTs 1 , 2 , 3  give an unprecedented view of their mode of action. Murakami  et al . ( page 173  of this issue) 1  and Seeger  et al . (writing in  Science ) 2  report the structure of AcrB, a transporter that uses the energy of the transmembrane proton gradient. And Dawson and Locher ( page 180  of this issue) 3  detail the structure of Sav1866, a transporter that derives its power from the breakdown of ATP molecules. Despite their different structures and energy sources, the transport mechanisms of the two proteins have a common feature: an inward-facing conformation with the substrate-binding site accessible from the cell interior, and an outward-facing conformation with an extrusion pocket exposed to the external medium. The transition between the two conformations is energy dependent. AcrB is a major MDT from  Escherichia coli  that has many close relatives in other pathogenic bacteria and that confers drug tolerance to these bacteria. AcrB functions in a complex with two accessory proteins \u2014 TolC and AcrA \u2014 to export a wide variety of substrates. AcrB determines the substrate specificity of the complex, and is also the site where its energy is used. The structures reported by Murakami  et al . 1  and Seeger  et al . 2  are consistent with previous structures 4 , 5  in that they show a threefold symmetry with three large subdomains. The functional unit is composed of three identical AcrB units (protomers), each with a transmembrane domain, a so-called porter domain, and a TolC-docking domain ( Fig. 1a ). The porter domain faces the periplasmic space between the plasma membrane and the outer membrane, where the substrate enters into the substrate-binding pockets. The TolC-docking domain has a central funnel that collects the substrate from each protomer and delivers it to the TolC protein located in the outer membrane. The new AcrB structures show a noteworthy deviation from symmetry that could not be detected in the previous structures: in the AcrB\u2013drug complex, each of the three protomers has a different conformation. The bound substrate is seen in only one of the three protomers (the 'binding' protomer;  Fig. 1b ). Exit from one of the vacant binding sites is open towards the TolC funnel, suggesting that this protomer is the form present just after extrusion of the substrate (the 'extrusion' protomer). The other vacant binding site looks to be the state just before substrate binding (the 'access' protomer). What causes this asymmetry and how it is connected to proton movement (the energy source) remains unclear. However, hints are provided by differences between the three protomers in the transmembrane region where three amino-acid residues were previously suggested to be involved in proton transport. In the 'access' and the 'binding' protomers, a positively charged lysine (Lys 940) is connected by salt bridges to two aspartic acids (Asp 407 and Asp 408). By contrast, in the 'extrusion' protomer, Lys 940 is turned nearly 457 towards a threonine (Thr 978) in the transmembrane region TM11 of the protein, and the salt bridges are abolished. This change may cause the twisting of two transmembrane helices that would influence the movement of other subdomains, including those in the porter domain. The structure suggests a mechanism whereby drugs enter the binding domain, move through the uptake channel and bind in the large internal pocket. At this point, exit from the binding site is blocked. In the extrusion state, however, the entrance closes and the exit opens. The bound drug is pushed out into the funnel by distortion of the binding pocket. These changes are probably coupled to proton movement across the membrane, and may be induced by protonation and deprotonation of Lys 940, Asp 407 and Asp 408 in the transmembrane domains. The structure reported by Dawson and Locher 3  is of Sav1866, an MDT from  Staphylococcus aureus . It is a member of the large 'ABC transporter' family and, as expected from previous studies of this family (for a review see ref.  6 ), its basic architecture consists of two identical units, with two transmembrane domains that provide a pathway across the membrane, and two cytoplasmic nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs) that break down the ATP nucleotide to provide energy. The structure shows the ATP-bound state, where the NBDs tightly sandwich the nucleotide between them ( Fig. 2a ). This is consistent with many kinetic and biochemical studies and with structures of isolated NBD domains containing trapped ATP (for example, from the archaeal ABC protein MJ0796) 7 . It differs, however, from two other ABC-transporter structures: that of the  E. coli  vitamin B12 transporter BtuCD crystallized in the absence of nucleotide 8 , and that of the  Staphylococcus typhimurium  transporter called MsbA (refs  9 ,  10 ). Probably the most surprising feature of the new structure 3  is that, in the middle of the membrane, bundles of transmembrane helices diverge into two discrete 'wings' that point away from one another and consist of helices TM1\u2013TM2 from one subunit and TM3\u2013TM6 from the other. So, rather than being aligned side-by-side, the two subunits of Sav1866 are intricately interleaved. Given these constraints, they are unlikely to move independently and their maximum separation during the reaction cycle is therefore limited ( Fig. 2b ). This view contradicts mechanistic models that suggest that the NBDs join together upon binding ATP and then dissociate upon completing a transport cycle. In both structures, the power provided by the energy release (either from the proton gradient or ATP) results in long-range modifications in the accessibility of the xenobiotic-binding site(s) that are transmitted by twisting and tilting of one or more transmembrane helices. In the case of Sav1866, the tight association between the two transmembrane domains was unexpected. In the case of AcrB, the surprising asymmetric structure seems to be essential for function and dictates the ordered occupancy of the binding site. This ordered binding mechanism, termed functional rotation by Murakami  et al ., is similar in principle to the ATP breakdown/synthesis mechanism of the enzyme F 1 F o -ATPase, except that in AcrB there is no mechanical rotation. It is possible that this is a remnant of the evolutionary process that led to the development of true rotary molecular machines. The AcrB structure also provides a neat explanation of how the cell increases the effectiveness of the system, because one TolC molecule is sufficient to eliminate xenobiotic substrates from three monomers that may be removing three different chemical species. How the substrates are removed from the cytoplasm is not yet clear, however. There is compelling evidence that AcrB eliminates many substrates directly from the periplasmic space before they even enter the cell, but it is very likely that it can also expel xenobiotics that have entered the cytoplasm. Extensive studies will be needed to understand the transport mechanism fully, but the new structures 1 , 2 , 3  provide some of the ins and outs of the overall process. In addition, the work suggests that a careful re-evaluation of previous structures 4 , 5 , 8 , 9 , 10  is called for. The structures may prove to be essential tools in tackling the serious problems posed by drug resistance and the diseases caused by mutations in the human versions of these transporters.

Van Allen, who died in Iowa City on 9 August, was a native of Iowa \u2014 he was born in the small town of Mount Pleasant on 7 September 1914 \u2014 and lived and worked there for most of his life. But his influence, as a founding father of magnetospheric physics and world-renowned leader in the scientific exploration of space, extended far beyond the boundaries of his home state. After attending both high school and the Iowa Wesleyan College in Mount Pleasant, Van Allen went to the University of Iowa in Iowa City, where he graduated with a PhD in physics in 1939. Following a spell in the department of terrestrial magnetism at the Carnegie Institution in Washington DC, Van Allen moved shortly after the outbreak of the Second World War to the Applied Physics Laboratory of Johns Hopkins University in Silver Springs, Maryland. There he worked to develop proximity fuses that allowed anti-aircraft shells to detonate automatically when reflected radio waves indicated the approach of a target. When the development phase of this project was finished, he was commissioned as a lieutenant in the US Navy and sent to the Pacific to test the fuses under combat conditions. For this assignment, he received four combat stars. After the war, back initially at Johns Hopkins, and from 1951 as head of physics at the University of Iowa, Van Allen pioneered the use of Geiger tubes to measure cosmic rays at high altitudes. These tubes were initially attached to captured German V-2 and US Aerobee rockets, but Van Allen soon developed his own low-cost, balloon-borne rocket \u2014 which he called a rockoon \u2014 to carry out the studies at similar altitudes. The first comprehensive latitudinal survey of cosmic-ray intensities above Earth's atmosphere followed, using a series of rockets launched from ships as part of the 1957\u201358 International Geophysical Year. During this period, Van Allen was also engaged in the development of an artificial satellite as part of the navy's Vanguard programme. On 4 October 1957, before these plans came to fruition, the Soviet Union launched the world's first satellite, Sputnik 1. In the ensuing frantic catch-up effort, Van Allen was asked to put his Geiger-tube instrumentation on a spacecraft, Explorer 1, to be carried by a rocket developed by Wernher von Braun. The spacecraft launched successfully on 31 January 1958. Strapped to Explorer 1, the Geiger tube produced what seemed to be erratic results. When passing over terrestrial receiving stations, it sometimes transmitted the expected cosmic-ray counting rates, and at other times did not count at all. A similar instrument on the Explorer 3 spacecraft carried a tape recorder that could record the counting rate for an entire orbit. This revealed that the periods of apparent non-operation were caused by extremely intense charged-particle radiation, thousands of times more intense than the cosmic-ray background, that were simply saturating the counter. The Van Allen belts \u2014 two doughnut-shaped regions of energetic charged particles surrounding Earth \u2014 had been discovered. This entirely unexpected find attracted worldwide attention. Van Allen and his colleagues soon showed that the particles of the radiation belt \u2014 mainly protons in the inner belt and electrons in the outer belt \u2014 were trapped in stable, long-lived orbits by Earth's magnetic field. Over the nearly 50 years since the discovery of the belts, the study of this trapped radiation and its many effects, such as magnetic storms and auroral light emissions, has blossomed into a wide field known as magnetospheric physics. Not content with his pioneering work on Earth's magnetosphere, Van Allen extended his research to other planets. He and his colleagues built similar Geiger-tube instrumentation for the Mariner 2 and 4 flights to Venus and Mars, respectively, and the Pioneer 10 and 11 flights to Jupiter and Saturn. Although Venus and Mars did not have radiation belts, Jupiter and Saturn were shown to have very large magnetospheres. As Pioneers 10 and 11 moved outward from the Sun, they also performed the first studies of the entry of cosmic rays into the heliosphere. This is the region around the Sun in which the solar wind \u2014 the stream of charged particles given off by its surface \u2014 has a controlling influence. During his career, Van Allen published prolifically, producing more than 275 research papers and several books, one of which,  Origins of Magnetospheric Physics , gives a detailed account of the early days of that field. He received many honours and prizes for his pioneering work in the field of space research, including the National Medal of Science in 1987, and the Crafoord prize \u2014 awarded by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in disciplines outside the Nobel prize categories \u2014 in 1989. Van Allen was also an outstanding teacher and mentor. He routinely taught a large, very popular undergraduate course in astronomy, and placed a strong emphasis on student involvement in his research. Many of his 34 PhD and 48 MSc students went on to become leaders in magnetospheric and space physics. That in turn gave university-based research a leading role in the US space programme, a role that endures today. Van Allen's influence on his profession was immense. He served on many local and national scientific advisory committees. A strong proponent of robotic spacecraft, he became a persistent critic of human spaceflight, especially of the space shuttle and the International Space Station. He regarded these missions as inordinately expensive relative to the results obtained. For his qualities of humanity and leadership in space science, James Van Allen will be missed by all who knew and worked with him. Reprints and Permissions"},

USA  doi:10.1073/pnas.0603901103; 2006), one species of the blister beetle  Meloe franciscanus  is a particularly innovative passenger: it can hail its taxi ride. This blister beetle lives in the deserts of the southwestern United States. It feeds and lays its eggs under a plant that also provides nectar for the beetles' host and transporter species, a solitary bee of the species  Habropoda pallida . Larvae of the beetle cooperatively form a spherical mass on the plant (right image), and simply hitch a ride when a male bee intent on mating with a female makes contact (left image). When the infested male copulates with a real female, the larvae are transferred and carried to the bee's nest. There they set up camp, and complete their development into adults nourished by the pollen and nectar stores of the nest and by the bee's egg. Saul-Gershenz and Millar set out to test what lures the bees to make contact with the larvae in the first place.

And this heady blend of alkenes did indeed attract the male bees. It seems the beetle larvae have evolved a way to exploit the bee's sexual communication system as a means of calling a cab.

The fragile bones of infants rarely survive long enough to make it into the hominin fossil record. But if they do, they provide precious evidence about the growth and development of the individual and its species. This helps researchers not only to understand how such processes have changed during hominin evolution, but also to interpret the function and the taxonomic significance of the better-sampled adult specimens. In this respect, the remarkably complete 3.3-million-year-old skeleton of a three-year-old  Australopithecus afarensis  female, found in Dikika, Ethiopia, is a veritable mine of information about a crucial stage in human evolutionary history. In this issue, the fossil is described by Alemseged  et al . ( page 296 ) 1 , and its geological and palaeontological context is reported by Wynn  et al . ( page 332 ) 2 . Thanks to efforts in Ethiopia and elsewhere, we already know a good deal about  A. afarensis . It has been called an 'archaic' hominin for at least two reasons. First, it is old: its fossils date from between 4 million and 3 million years ago. Second, its morphology is archaic, in the sense that its brain case, jaws and limb bones are much more ape-like than those of later taxa that are rightly included in our own genus,  Homo . When adjusted for its body size, the brain of  A. afarensis  is not much larger than that of a chimpanzee, and although it has lost the large canines that distinguish apes from hominins, other aspects of its dentition, such as its relatively large chewing teeth, are still primitive ( Fig. 1 ). There remains a great deal of controversy regarding the posture and locomotion of  A. afarensis . Most researchers accept that it could stand upright and walk on two feet, but whether it could climb up and move through trees is still disputed. Some suggest that its adaptations to walking on two feet preclude any significant arboreal locomotion, and interpret any limb features that support such locomotion as evolutionary baggage without any useful function 3 . Others suggest that a primitive limb morphology would not have persisted unless it served a purpose 4 . The Dikika infant is not the first early hominin infant to be found. That distinction belongs to the Taung child, whose discovery was reported just over 80 years ago 5 . What makes the Dikika infant remarkable is its unprecedented completeness for such a geologically ancient specimen. The infant was found in sediments that formed the bottom of a small channel close to where a river discharged into a lake 2 . This was not a turbulent stream or river. The flow was sluggish, typical of the type of braided streams that make up a river delta. The corpse of the infant was buried more or less intact, and the sediment in flood waters must have swiftly covered it. Some parts of the specimen \u2014 the pelvis, the lowest part of the back and parts of the limbs \u2014 are still missing, but what is preserved is remarkably complete. The face, the brain case and the base of the cranium, the lower jaw, all but two of the teeth (including unerupted adult teeth still in the jaw), both collar bones, the vertebrae down to the lower back, many ribs, both knee caps and the delicate bone that holds open the throat, the hyoid, are all there. Even the medial epicondyle of the humerus has survived. This is the bony projection on the inside of your elbow against which your left thumb rubs if you hold your right elbow with your left hand. In a three-year-old infant, this tiny piece of bone is still separate from the main shaft of the humerus. One must travel forward in time more than three million years, to a Neanderthal infant from Dederiyeh 6 , Syria, to find a comparably complete hominin infant skeleton. This anatomical cornucopia was not evident when the specimen was found in 2000: most of the Dikika infant was invisible, hidden within a slab of sandstone. Zeresenay Alemseged has devoted many thousands of hours over a five-year period to removing, painstakingly, the cement-like matrix that surrounds the delicate bones. The patience, time, skill and effort required to preserve and expose the morphology of this and other similar early hominin fossils 7  should not be underestimated. But why are Alemseged  et al . 1  so sure that the infant belongs to  A. afarensis , and can we have confidence in its age \u2014 both the geological age of the fossil and the age of the child it represents? The geological age is secure. The Dikika sediments contain crucial evidence of the same layers of ash that have provided reliable argon\u2013argon isotope ages at other East African fossil sites 2 . There are also subtle and not so subtle differences between the faces of  A. afarensis  and the other hominin taxa known from similarly aged rocks, and the Dikika infant already shows signs of the type of upper jaw and nasal morphology that is seen only in  A. afarensis . These signs are a rounded area above the upper teeth; a separation between the bone covering the roots of the upper canine teeth and the edge of the opening for the nose; and hourglass-shaped nasal bones that fit into a recess in the frontal bone much like a tenon fits into a mortise. The second of the two age estimates, the chronological age of the infant, is less secure. All one can do is use the kind of computed-tomography imaging familiar from modern hospitals to compare the development of the yet-to-emerge permanent tooth germs of the Dikika infant with the teeth of modern human and chimpanzee infants of known ages 8 . The best match is with three-year-old chimpanzees. But it is highly unlikely that the pace of development of  A. afarensis  was exactly the same as that of modern chimpanzees. So, for now, the chronological age of the Dikika infant must remain an informed guess. The discoverers of the Dikika fossil have only just begun the task of capturing all the data contained in the specimen, but already these preliminary data 1  are informing the controversy of how  A. afarensis  moved. If its mode of locomotion was exclusively on two legs, one would expect that the limb bones and the organs that help it to balance would be more similar to those of the only living bipedal higher primate (that is, us) than to those of chimpanzees and gorillas. These primates walk on two feet only rarely, if at all. Alemseged  et al . 1  pay careful attention to the shoulder, hand and the semicircular canals of the inner ear, the morphologies of which record the motion of the body. The shoulder-bone (scapula) of the fossil is more like that of a gorilla than a modern human, and the bones of the only complete finger are curved like those of a chimpanzee. Chimpanzee finger bones begin life only slightly curved, but become more curved when the hands are used to climb branches 9 ; this is what seems to have happened in the case of the Dikika infant. Lastly, images of the inner ear of the specimen show it to have semicircular canals more like those of chimpanzees than of modern humans 10 . The fluid-filled semicircular canals are crucial in maintaining balance, and so all three lines of evidence suggest that the locomotion of  A. afarensis  was unlikely to have been restricted to walking on two feet. I am especially intrigued by the detailed morphology of the hyoid bone in the throat of the fossil. Does the open space in the body of the hyoid mean that  A. afarensis  had air sacs in its neck? In the absence of large canines, these air sacs might have been a way in which males established a dominance hierarchy, and females judged the quality of a potential mate. Whatever the answers to such questions, the Dikika infant has the potential to provide a wealth of information about the growth and development, function and taxonomy of  A. afarensis .

USA  doi: 10.1073/pnas0605552103; 2006) now explain the role played in this gripping drama by an unusual amino acid named  L -DOPA, which is found in at least five adhesive proteins in the mussel's threads. Essentially,  L -DOPA acts as the glue that sticks the adhesive proteins to surfaces. Using the technique of atomic force microscopy, the authors showed that  L -DOPA molecules bind surprisingly strongly to a titanium surface, which is a good model for inorganic surfaces such as rock. The combined effect of large numbers of these interactions is so great that if a whole mussel protein were pulled away from a surface, the protein itself would break apart before the binding to the surface gave way. These interactions are reversible in ambient conditions, which implies that they cannot be covalent bonds. In the marine environment, some of the  L -DOPA units in the adhesive proteins would become oxidized. Messersmith  et al . show that oxidized  L -DOPA binds weakly to titanium but apparently forms strong covalent bonds to organic surfaces. The solidification of mussel glues was long suspected to be related to this oxidation process. The double stickiness accounts for the strength of the bonding in natural conditions and also means that  L -DOPA might be a suitable adhesive for attaching biological molecules to surfaces \u2014 and thus invaluable for medical applications.

All animal movement depends on muscle contractions. Nerve impulses cause a change of electrical potential across the muscle-cell membrane, which rapidly propagates to both ends of the cell, causing contraction. How electrical excitation at the muscle cell's surface induces contraction of the proteins packed inside was one of the biggest mysteries in physiology for decades. It was Setsuro Ebashi, who died on 17 July 2006 at the age of 83, who essentially solved this conundrum. Muscle cells contain two types of filament that are aligned along the long axis of the cell. Contraction occurs when the protein myosin in the 'thick' filaments reacts with another protein, actin, in the 'thin' filaments, causing the filaments to slide across each other, pulling the ends of the cell closer together. The process is fuelled by the breakdown of ATP. The biochemical basis of contraction was largely determined by Albert Szent-Gy\u00f6rgyi in the 1940s, and the biophysical and structural basis was uncovered by Jean Hanson and Hugh Huxley, and by Andrew Huxley and R. Niedergerke, during the 1950s. But how the process was triggered by nerves remained a mystery. Ebashi discovered that in the absence of calcium ions, no contractile reaction occurs, even when ATP is added to the myosin\u2013actin system, but that with even a minute amount of calcium (of the order of 1 micromolar), ATP induces a vigorous contractile reaction. This calcium-dependence had been previously overlooked by biochemists because of low-level contamination from laboratory glassware and impurities in the chemical reagents. Ebashi took tremendous pains to avoid contamination by calcium ions in all the solutions and protein preparations he used, making his results unequivocal. His work was consistent with contemporary results from Annemarie Weber, who showed independently that the breakdown of ATP during the contractile reaction requires minute amounts of calcium. The idea that calcium might be involved in muscle contraction came to Ebashi during his studies on the 'relaxing factor' reported by B. B. Marsh in 1951. This was a fraction of the homogenate that is made when muscle cells are ground up, and it could induce relaxation of the myosin\u2013actin system. Ebashi proved that relaxing factor is nothing but fragmented pieces of a muscle-specific organelle called the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Enquiring into the factor's mechanism of action, Ebashi got a hint from Emil Bozler's result in 1954 that EDTA \u2014 a 'chelating' agent that sequesters calcium \u2014 causes relaxation. Ebashi compared the calcium-binding activity of various chelating agents with their relaxing activity and found that they correlated exactly. He further showed that fragmented sarcoplasmic reticulum can accumulate calcium ions rapidly in the presence of ATP, and so can remove enough calcium from the surrounding medium to cause relaxation. The relaxation process is the reverse of contraction, so Ebashi proposed what is our current understanding of excitation\u2013contraction coupling: excitation at the surface membrane somehow sends a signal to the sarcoplasmic reticulum; this releases the calcium ions that accumulate there during the relaxing and resting period, and the flood of calcium ions induces the contractile reaction. Examining the process more closely, Ebashi discovered that purified myosin and actin react with ATP even in the complete absence of calcium ions, and that the regulatory action of calcium is exerted only in the presence of a certain protein factor. This factor turned out to be a mixture of tropomyosin, a protein that previously had no known function, and a newly discovered protein that Ebashi named troponin. Tropomyosin and troponin are present with actin in the thin filaments . In the absence of calcium ions, the two proteins cooperate to inhibit actin, preventing it from interacting with myosin in the thick filaments. Having found that calcium binds strongly to troponin, Ebashi proposed that the resulting conformational changes in troponin are transmitted through tropomyosin to actin to remove the inhibition, and the contractile reaction ensues \u2014 a mechanism that has subsequently been confirmed. In the early 1960s, the idea that a simple inorganic ion such as calcium controls contraction was not popular among most biochemists \u2014 the prevailing belief was that such an important biological phenomenon as contraction should be regulated by sophisticated organic molecules. So Ebashi had a hard time getting his ideas taken seriously, despite his clear evidence. Only after the discovery of troponin and his elucidation of the mechanism did everybody accept the regulatory role of calcium ions. The regulatory roles of calcium are not confined to muscle contraction. Since Ebashi's discovery, numerous cellular processes, including the release of neurotransmitters and hormones, metabolic switching and gene expression, have been found to be controlled by calcium. Thus, Ebashi really broke open the field of calcium signalling, and profoundly influenced life science as a whole. Setsuro Ebashi was brilliant from childhood. He skipped a year in both primary and middle schools and was admitted into the Dai-ichi High School, the most prestigious high school in Japan at the time. He was promoted to be professor of pharmacology at the University of Tokyo at the age of 36. But his scientific success was not only due to his sharp mind \u2014 he worked extremely hard in the laboratory, until after midnight most nights. Although he had many collaborators, most notably his wife Fumiko Ebashi, all the major results were, amazingly, produced by Ebashi himself. As one of the most respected scientists in physiology and pharmacology worldwide, Ebashi received numerous honours, including the Order of Cultural Merit, the highest scientific honour in Japan. He was a Member of the Japan Academy and a Foreign Member of the Royal Society in London, and of several other academies, including those of the United States, Germany and Belgium. He also contributed to the global scientific community as president of the International Union for Pure and Applied Biophysics (1978\u201381) and the International Union of Pharmacology (1990\u201394), and presided over the International Congress of Pharmacology held in Tokyo in 1981. Ebashi was a man of attractive personality: charismatic, warm-hearted, helpful and loyal to his colleagues, and patriotic to his country. Despite suffering physical handicaps following a stroke in 2000, he kept a clear mind, and because his condition was fairly stable, nobody expected his sudden death. All his friends and pupils greatly lament it. Reprints and Permissions"},

Warren"}], "parsed_as_year": "2006_or_before", "body": "NMR spectroscopy has changed enormously over the years, but signal detection has stayed the same since the technique was invented. The latest thinking literally shines a new light on things. Sixty years ago, the forefront of speculative physics research included the nascent field of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Physicists placed atomic nuclei in a strong, constant magnetic field and then watched the voltages induced in a coil when the nuclei were perturbed with weak, finely tuned radio waves. At that time, NMR was a prime example of blue-skies research with no conceivable real-world applications. Since then, spectacular developments have established NMR as the foremost spectroscopic method for chemists, and Nobel prizes in physics, chemistry and medicine have been awarded for advances in NMR. Its descendant, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has become a mainstream diagnostic tool in medicine, and functional MRI \u2014 essentially, watching people think \u2014 may revolutionize neuroscience. As part of this evolution, almost everything has changed in the basic NMR set-up, except for the method of detection; nearly all NMR and MRI experiments still use the same 'nuclear induction' concept that was used 60 years ago to detect a signal. On  page 1021  of this issue 1 , Savukov  et al . report a radically different method to detect NMR signals in liquids: watching the small phase-shifts induced in a laser beam by nuclear spins. Bringing the power of modern optics to NMR detection could greatly improve image resolution, and perhaps even sensitivity. This would be a huge step forward, as many applications, for example in the emerging field of molecular imaging, are limited by these issues. This is not the first attempt to find a different detection method for magnetic resonance. For example, a tiny magnet placed close to a particle experiences a force exerted by the spin of that particle. Several groups have tried to detect this force directly. Signals from single electron spins 2  or from a few thousand nuclear spins 3  have been observed in this way, but the method is not suitable for macroscopic samples. There have even been other attempts to use optical detection in magnetic resonance. Under certain circumstances, electron spin-flips are coupled to changes in electronic energy levels, so that electronic spins can simply be measured by observing the light absorbed or emitted as the electrons jump between these levels 4 , 5 . More generally, there have been many attempts to look at variations in the NMR signals of liquids caused by the optical irradiation of those liquids. The largest changes are expected in the frequencies of signals from electronically excited molecules. Such changes are predicted to be sizeable, but the process required to create an excited population of molecules, known as near-resonant excitation, also heats the sample. This heating induces frequency shifts of its own 6  and severely limits the utility of the method. The technique now reported by Savukov  et al . 1  is known as nuclear-spin optical rotation (NSOR). This method looks for phase-shifts induced in a laser beam as it passes through a liquid, rather than for frequency shifts of signals in an NMR spectrum. Detecting an optical effect instead of nuclear spins has several advantages. Measurements of NMR frequency shifts require uniform laser irradiation of the sample, but NSOR can work with much smaller, tightly focused laser beams, which in principle permits micrometre-resolution measurements. This would be a vast improvement over existing techniques; obtaining even 100-micrometre resolution in MRI is challenging, for example. The NSOR method of detecting phase-shifts in a laser beam allows experimental designs that are less sensitive to sample heating compared with previous methods. Even three-dimensional tissue imaging is not out of the question with NSOR, as near-infrared light can penetrate many centimetres into tissue. NSOR is also enhanced by so-called hyperfine effects, which increase with the mass of the nucleus under investigation. This makes the technique particularly suitable for heavy nuclei, which generally give poor spectra in traditional NMR experiments. The greatest problem for NSOR at the moment is its sensitivity, which is not yet as good as conventional NMR. But optical detectors can be highly efficient, as single photons are much easier to detect than single spins, and Savukov and colleagues 1  suggest several potential improvements to their technique \u2014 for example, bouncing light off mirrors to pass it through the sample many times. In addition, modern technology gives us incredible control of the timing, shape and polarization of ultrafast laser pulses.

Lee  et al . ( Cell   126,  691\u2013699; 2006 ) report that the parasite responsible ( Trypanosoma brucei , pictured) has an unusual way of making a lipid it requires to survive in the blood stream. The extracellular surface of  T. brucei  is covered in proteins that are attached to the membrane through glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors. The bloodstream form of  T. brucei  needs a 14-carbon fatty acid to make the GPI anchors, and this molecule \u2014 named myristate \u2014 is essential for pathogenesis. Whereas most organisms synthesize fatty acids using type I or type II fatty-acid synthases, Lee  et al . find that in  T. brucei  myristate is made by a series of enzymes called elongases. As their name implies, these enzymes extend the fatty-acid chain, adding two carbon atoms at a time to a fatty acid that is attached to coenzyme A (CoA). The authors examined four candidate elongase (ELO) gene products and determined that ELO1 converts a 4-carbon CoA into a 10-carbon fatty acid; ELO2 uses a 10-carbon CoA to synthesize myristate; ELO3 converts a 14-carbon CoA into an 18-carbon fatty acid; and ELO4 elongates arachidonoyl-CoA into a 22-carbon fatty acid. It was previously known that ELOs could extend long fatty-acid chains, but this is the first example of a parasite that uses ELOs instead of type I or type II fatty-acid synthases to make a large fraction of its fatty acids. The authors then examined two related parasites ( Leishmania major  and  Trypanosoma cruzi ) and determined that both organisms contain ELOs that are probably involved in fatty-acid biosynthesis. Additional work is needed to explore how ELOs function  in vivo , but the authors suggest that it may be possible to exploit this unique pathway to develop new anti-parasitic drugs.

Boss"}], "parsed_as_year": "2006_or_before", "body": "Geochemist, planetary scientist and astrobiologist. Theories of the origin of the Solar System are necessarily uncertain, as the experiment that led to its formation cannot be repeated. But in the past few decades, our idea of how Earth and the other planets of the Solar System came to be has advanced from highly speculative musing to a true scientific theory with a firm base in hard facts. George W. Wetherill, who died on 19 July, was a leader in this effort to explain Earth's origins. Wetherill was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on 12 August 1925. After service in the Second World War, during which he taught the principles of radar at the Naval Research Laboratory in Washington DC, he studied at the University of Chicago, receiving a PhD in nuclear physics there in 1953. He then moved to the Department of Terrestrial Magnetism at the Carnegie Institution of Washington, where he began work on the first major challenge of his career: how to date geological samples precisely. At that time, the department's physicists, led by Merle Tuve, were exploring diverse subjects in Earth science, including the use of radioactive decay to date the point of crystallization of terrestrial rocks. In this environment, Wetherill was able to estimate for the first time the half-life of the extremely long-lived radioactive rubidium isotope  87 Rb by determining the rate at which  87 Rb must have decayed since its rocks formed \u2014 an age obtained independently by measurements of uranium decay. That meant that rocks could be dated precisely through the relative abundance of rubidium and its decay product, strontium. Together with potassium\u2013argon dating, this technique allowed precise ages to be determined from a far wider range of rocks, such as granites, that did not contain the rarer uranium ores. Wetherill was also able to bring clarity to data on the lead isotopes that, as decay products of uranium, had puzzled geochemists for years with their discordant ages. Wetherill developed the concordia diagram as a reliable means of obtaining precise crystallization ages, as well as evidence for later metamorphic disturbances, from uranium\u2013lead isotopic ratios. The diagram found immediate, lasting acceptance among geochemists, and Wetherill's injection of modern physics into geochemistry opened up the new field of radiometric geochronology. In 1960, partly to avoid the domineering Tuve, Wetherill accepted the offer of a professorship at the University of California, Los Angeles, where he undertook his second great challenge: understanding the orbital dynamics of asteroids and comets, and the likelihood that they might hit Earth. The switch in focus from laboratory geochemistry to theoretical calculations of orbits was entirely consistent with Wetherill's lifelong desire to work only where he could make a significant contribution to solving great outstanding problems. Here too, he met with success, determining the precise chance that a body orbiting in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter would end up on a collision course with Earth. These calculations provided a strong indication that meteorites found on Earth originated in the asteroid belt. Thus, laboratory measurements of the elemental and isotopic composition of meteorites provided information on the make-up of bodies elsewhere in the Solar System that were otherwise inaccessible to detailed analysis. Wetherill also showed that the highest-velocity fragments of bodies hitting Mars might be launched on orbits that would intersect that of Earth, a prediction spectacularly verified by the discovery of dozens of martian meteorites on Earth. Wetherill returned to the Department of Terrestrial Magnetism at Carnegie as its director in 1975. He was a fine director, but treated it as a part-time post. Anyone approaching him in his office would inevitably find him scanning a computer printout or a screen detailing the latest results of his own research, and he would only reluctantly divert his attention to departmental business. If it was a really serious matter, he would spin his ever-present pencil lengthwise between his fingers as he considered what to do. His first response to any request was invariably 'no'. But if one troubled to come back a second time, he would view the matter as important enough to perhaps reconsider the request. On the whole, the staff liked having a director who was more interested in doing his own work than in interfering with theirs. At Carnegie, Wetherill embarked on his third major task \u2014 clarifying the origin of Earth itself. Here, he built on the pioneering work of the Soviet scientist Victor Safronov, whose 1969 monograph on planet formation had become widely available in a translated version only in 1972. Wetherill adapted his calculations of the orbital dynamics of asteroids to compute the evolution of small, randomly colliding rocky bodies orbiting the early Sun. Using so-called Monte Carlo methods and increasingly powerful digital computers, he showed that a swarm of hundreds of lunar-mass bodies could form one or two Earth-mass planets (that is, Venus and Earth), and a few smaller rocky planets (Mercury and Mars), orbiting at roughly the observed distances from the Sun. This process would probably also involve one or two Mars-mass bodies hitting the growing Earth. If such a giant impact occurred off-centre, a spray of hot mantle would be placed in Earth orbit. That debris would later coalesce into the Moon. This neat solution eliminated problems that had bedevilled previous theories of lunar origin, and, like the concordia diagram, the giant-impact theory rapidly found widespread acceptance. Wetherill continued his research after retiring in 1991, calculating how terrestrial planets might form around other stars, and showing that Earth-like planets could form with masses several times that of Earth. If that is so, the extrasolar planets of less than ten Earth masses so far discovered might be just the high-mass outliers of a host of Earth-like worlds, with significant implications for the existence of life elsewhere in the Universe. Many details remain to be explored theoretically and tested by observations of other planetary systems, but this could be Wetherill's greatest legacy: a scientifically robust, universal theory of the formation of habitable, Earth-like planets.

Cells notorious for their involvement in allergy turn out to be vital to this protective function. The immune system's capacity to regulate its own activities can be exploited to prevent rejection of transplanted organs and to reverse autoimmune diseases such as diabetes. The chief agents of this immune self-regulation system are specialized cells \u2014 T regulatory cells (T reg ) \u2014 that somehow prevent other immune cells from attacking healthy tissues. In this issue ( page 997 ) 1 , Lu  et al . 1  demonstrate that the protective actions of T reg  cells depend on so-called mast cells, which were hitherto bad-mouthed for their undesirable role in allergic responses. Perhaps, at last, a virtuous physiological role for mast cells has been uncovered. Long-term tolerance of transplanted tissues by the body can be achieved by using a short treatment of antibodies that block vital co-receptors (CD4 and CD8) or co-stimulatory molecules (CD154) on a subset of immune cells (T cells). This reprogramming of the immune system depends on the activity of specialized regulatory CD4 +  T cells (T reg ) that are drawn to the transplanted tissue and its surrounding milieu. The T reg  cells confer on the tissue some special exemption from attack, just as the fetus in the womb is protected from the mother's immune system. A major goal of current immunological research is to establish just how T reg  cells ensure this ceasefire. A clue to what that mechanism is came from the observation that cultures of T reg  cells tend to be contaminated with 'unwanted' mast cells 2 . This was attributed to a secreted molecule called IL-9 that is made by the T reg  cells and that enhances mast cell growth and functionality. More surprisingly, when recipient mice that were tolerating a skin graft were given a second graft from an identical donor, the second graft became infiltrated not only with T reg  cells, but also with mast cells 3 . This led to the proposal that T reg  and mast cells might form a functional unit that mediates graft tolerance 2 , 3 . Lu  et al . 1  confirm these findings and extend them by performing crucial work using an experimental mouse strain (C57BL/6\u2013Kit W-sh /Kit W-sh ) that is genetically engineered to be deficient in mast cells 4 . The authors used these mice as recipients for transplants, but their attempts to induce therapeutic tolerance in the mice were unsuccessful, as all the test grafts were promptly rejected. Spectacularly, however, injecting mast-cell-enriched cell cultures into the recipient mice restored the host's capacity to accept grafts for prolonged periods. The second major breakthrough by Lu  et al . 1  comes from the discoveries that all categories of T reg  cell make IL-9, that IL-9 can be found in the tolerated graft, and that neutralization of IL-9  in vivo  prevents regulation of graft rejection by T reg  cells. The authors interpret the findings as indicating that IL-9 from T reg  cells is involved in the recruitment and activation of mast cells at the graft site. Mast cells belong to the 'innate' immune system \u2014 the system that provides immediate defence against microbes that the body hasn't encountered before. Although they participate in immune responses, they do not intrinsically recognize unique antigens. The recognition of specific antigens is mediated instead by the 'adaptive' immune system, where cells such as T cells remember previous microbe encounters and react strongly against the aliens if the infection is repeated. When it comes to immunity towards microbes, cells of the innate immune system, including mast cells, macrophages and dendritic cells, interact with the adaptive system in two ways. First, they sense dangerous microbes through generic receptors for potential pathogens, and, once activated, they alert the adaptive system to the danger. Mast cells, for instance, expel packets of mediator molecules (including histamine) that cause an immediate inflammatory reaction and attract adaptive cells. Second, innate immune cells can act as the executive arm of the adaptive system, once armed with antibodies or mobilized to killer-mode by T-cell-derived mediators. Recent research on macrophages and dendritic cells has taught us that the innate immune system may also mediate the opposing process of permanently decommissioning adaptive cells so that they cannot mount an immune response. For example, immature dendritic cells display antigens in a way that makes T cells tolerate that antigen so they no longer respond to it. Moreover, T reg  cells can manifest their suppressive activity by modulating dendritic cells, so that the dendritic cells are no longer able to alert the adaptive cells to danger. Perhaps this symmetry \u2014 in both activating and inhibiting adaptive reactions \u2014 is a general feature of innate cells. We have tended to think of these cells as agents of destruction, waiting around until the microbe appears. Now, there are reasonable grounds for elevating their status to cells that have a positive physiological role \u2014 ensuring self-tolerance and/or tissue integrity through the maintenance of 'privileged' microenvironments where adaptive immune responses are damped down ( Fig. 1 ). The implications of the Lu  et al . 1  paper go beyond transplantation. This work could form the basis for understanding why mast cells are located in very specific sites within tissues (for example, nerves, vessels, hair follicles or epithelia). It was always hard to see how this positioning was related to their potential for immune function. Perhaps these sites require some low-level immune privilege. Also, is it possible that the mast cells found within tumours contribute some immune privilege? In support of this idea, mast-cell-deficient mice seem to have some natural resistance to the induction of tumours 5 . Which checkpoint of the immune self-regulatory response needs the mast cells is not yet established. Are they required to induce T cells to a regulatory role or are they required at some later phase in the execution of that function? Either way, the current findings will galvanize research into the molecular basis by which mast cells decommission immune function, and provide a possible new direction for acquiring drug targets.

For the  century : divide by 4 and calculate  5 times the remainder . B. For the  year : add  to the number the quotient obtained from divisor 4 . C. For the  month : multiply by 4, and  negate the units digit  ( i.e.  subtract instead of adding it). D. For the  day  retain the number unchanged. Then add together the results A, B, C, D (casting out  sevens , of course, as you proceed), and the result gives the required day of the week... Examples \u20141815, June 18 (Battle of Waterloo). A.

Although most chemists still use flasks for their reactions, a growing number of them make their molecules using miniaturized devices. These 'labs on chips' require only tiny quantities of reagents, thus reducing cost, producing less waste and cutting down the time needed to perform a reaction and to analyse its products. Although it is quite easy to perform a single reaction on a chip, it is much harder to carry out multiple reactions in the same device, making several different molecules. But now Hartmuth C. Kolb, Hsian-Rong Tseng and their colleagues have developed a device (pictured) that can perform 32 reactions at the same time. The group reports its results in  Angewandte Chemie  (doi:10.1002/anie.200601677). The authors miniaturized a technique known as ' in situ  click chemistry', which can be used to identify high-affinity inhibitors for enzymes. These inhibitors can then be used in other biological experiments: for example, the molecules can be used to block the enzyme's 'active site' to see how it works, or to elucidate its cellular role. Two compounds \u2014 one containing an azide group, and another containing an acetylene group \u2014 are combined in a reaction vessel with the target enzyme. Molecules of both compounds may enter the enzyme's active site, and orient themselves so that the azide group and the acetylene group fit comfortably inside. If the two groups align favourably, then 'click', they react to form a five-membered ring. Because this click reaction occurs in the active site of the enzyme, the product usually binds very tightly to that enzyme. By miniaturizing this process on a chip, the authors were able to run 32 reactions at the same time to find inhibitors for a well-known target enzyme (bovine carbonic anhydrase II) using much less of the protein than would have been needed in a traditional, microtitre-based procedure. Many interesting proteins are notoriously difficult to obtain in large quantities, preventing their use in biochemical assays for inhibitors. This chip enables such proteins to be screened at last, and may open up many areas for biological and medicinal study. Reprints and Permissions"},

DiCarlo"}], "parsed_as_year": "2006_or_before", "body": "Artificially activating the right neurons at the right time causes visual perception of a face. This new result shows that such neurons directly underlie the recognition of complex objects. You look up from your desk and instantly recognize the person that has just walked into your office. Unlike the mathematical proof you were busy constructing, recognizing your colleague does not seem to require any mental effort at all. But the apparent ease of this task belies its computational difficulty, and the ability of the primate brain to recognize complex objects, such as faces, in complex environments, such as offices, is a pinnacle of evolutionary achievement. Investigating the brain mechanisms underlying object recognition is also very difficult. However, as they describe on  page 692   of this issue, Afraz and colleagues 1  have successfully given us new traction on the problem. Although we still have only a rudimentary understanding of how the brain accomplishes visual object recognition, the work of many groups has uncovered a hierarchically ordered series of brain areas likely to support this remarkable feat 2 . One of the most intriguing observations is that neurons at the highest levels of this series respond strongly when their 'preferred' object is in view, often regardless of its exact position, size, contrast, pose and even background clutter. Creating this neuronal response property is the computational crux of object recognition, as even small populations of these neurons can categorize objects with remarkable speed 3 . We know that this neuronal activity is correlated with object perception by the brain's owner 4 , and even with his or her imagination of objects 5 . Yet there has been no direct evidence that these neurons actually cause subjects to perceive objects. Afraz and colleagues 1  now provide such evidence. In particular, the authors show that artificial activation of groups of high-level visual neurons that prefer one class of object \u2014 faces \u2014 causes subjects to tend to perceive faces, even if a face is not present. Working with rhesus monkeys, a well-studied animal model of human vision, the authors focused on the putative highest visual brain area in this species \u2014 the inferior temporal cortex (IT) \u2014 where neurons respond highly selectively to visually presented faces and other complex objects as outlined above. The researchers used fine microelectrodes to sample the activity of neurons at many locations across IT, and positioned the microelectrode at locations where many neurons responded preferentially to faces \u2014 that is, responded with high activity only when images of faces were shown to the animal. To ask if IT neuronal activity somehow causes perception, the authors injected tiny amounts of electrical current through the microelectrode tip; this method is called microstimulation, and is known to activate neurons within several hundred micrometres 6 . The prevailing, but previously unsubstantiated view is that IT neurons that respond preferentially to an object are somehow responsible for allowing the subject to perceive and report the presence of that object. So artificial activation of face-preferring neurons by microstimulation might, in theory, lead to face perception. But how does one ask a monkey what it perceives? To do this, Afraz  et al . 1  drew on well-established behavioural methods 7 . They first trained each monkey to look left if a face was presented and to look right if a non-face object was presented. Once the animals had mastered this face-detection task, the authors made the task more challenging by degrading the object images with varying amounts of visual noise (see Fig. 1a of their paper 1  on page 692). Averaged over many behavioural trials, this procedure provides a sensitive perceptual assay of the monkey's tendency to report 'seeing' a face rather than a non-face. Using these methods, the authors showed that, in behavioural trials in which microstimulation was applied to face-preferring neurons, monkeys had a reliably greater tendency to report seeing a face, relative to trials in which no microstimulation was applied. For example, even when the visual stimulus contained no object at all, but only noise, microstimulation increased the chance of the animal 'seeing' a face in that noise. Importantly, these effects were both temporally and spatially specific \u2014 they were stronger when microstimulation was applied during a brief time interval in which IT neurons normally respond to visual stimuli, and they did not occur when microstimulation was applied at non-face-preferring IT locations. Together, these exciting results show that targeted microstimulation of IT induces face perception \u2014 probably through the activation of groups of face-selective IT neurons. Because neuronal activity is almost universally believed to underlie conscious perception, it is at one level not surprising that artificial neuronal activation leads to perceptual changes, and this has been shown in other visual areas 7 . However, Afraz and colleagues' study directly implicates IT neurons as causal in face perception, and also suggests that the millisecond-by-millisecond detail of their activity is not as important as the fact that they are active. Moreover, because the strong microstimulation used activates perhaps thousands of nearby neurons 6 , the study provides firm support for the idea that nearby IT neurons have similar functions 8 . Indeed, it is noteworthy that the study used faces, as they are an ethologically important object class, and face-selective neurons may be clustered together to an unusually strong degree 9 , 10 . It remains to be seen if artificially induced perceptual shifts can be obtained for other object classes. Beyond directly implicating IT in object recognition, such work might eventually allow the creation of visual prosthetics to interact with the brain's high-level object memories. For example, one can imagine even very low-density electrode devices that could activate combinations of IT neuronal clusters to produce awareness of objects (such as a face, car, dog, table, cup, and so on) that are in front of a blind user. However, for deep understanding, the key to progress will be to move from the phenomenology of IT responses to underlying computational mechanisms. In particular, we already know that relatively simple, biologically plausible circuits can 'read out' object identity from IT neurons over behaviourally relevant timescales 3 . But the central problem is understanding how the brain constructs those IT responses in the first place 11 , 12 . That is, how  do  you recognize that person that just walked into your office?

The daring combination of tone intervals \u2014 the dissonant augmented fourth; the dynamic, imperfectly consonant major third; the highly consonant perfect fourth \u2014 came to be seen as a key change in attitudes to harmony, an overture to the atonality of much subsequent classical music. The question of how simultaneous notes combine to form aesthetically pleasing (or displeasing) harmonies, and how each harmony best evolves to the next one \u2014 a technique known as counterpoint, or voice leading \u2014 has exercised music theorists for centuries. Dmitri Tymoczko ( Science   313,  72\u201374; 2006 ) is the latest to attempt to systematize such relationships mathematically, with the goal of establishing a universal 'geometry' of musical chords. A musical octave separates one note from another similar-sounding note of double (or half) the frequency. In the Western tradition, each octave is divided into 12 distinctive tones. Tymoczko therefore uses a simple logarithmic expression to convert the fundamental frequency of each note to a real number in 'pitch space', starting from C (which is 0) and Csharp (1) and going to A (9), Bflat (designated as  t ) and B ( e ). After B comes C, which, as the start of the next octave, is 0 again. The geometrical distance in pitch space between two chords can then be assessed through a 'voice-leading size', a relative measure of how much the constituent notes in one chord must change to make the second. The results can be used to form a geometrical space, called an orbifold, on which the separation between any two chords is proportional to their voice-leading size. Because of the cyclical nature of the octave, the orbifold loops back on itself: for two-tone chords, for example, it resembles a M\u00f6bius strip \u2014 with a half-twist along its circumference \u2014 whose boundaries, for the purposes of voice leading, act like a mirror. An equivalent picture applies in higher dimensions (corresponding to chords with more notes), creating a unified framework for considering all possible chord combinations. So what does this teach us? It seems that many of the chord progressions favoured by composers in constructing pleasing counterpoints exploit symmetries of the orbifold's geometry. Chords that divide an octave almost evenly are said to be near transpositional symmetry, and include the familiar consonant chords. These chords cluster into the centre of the orbifold. Nearly permutationally symmetric chords, on the other hand, which involve notes that are close together and therefore sound dissonant, collect towards the boundaries. A third class of chord, known as nearly inversionally symmetric, is scattered throughout the orbifold. Such chords are prominent in both tonal and atonal music \u2014 and particularly in the works of such nineteenth-century pioneers as Richard Wagner. Reprints and Permissions"},

( page 1157 ) 3  provide clues to the basis of degeneration in Parkinson's disease by linking two causative mechanisms that were previously thought to be separate. Most cases of typical \u2018sporadic\u2019 Parkinson's disease are believed to result from a lifetime of environmental exposures superimposed on an individual's genetic susceptibilities. However, a small fraction of cases (probably less than 10%) is caused by single-gene mutations. These provide insights into the cellular pathways involved in neurodegeneration 4 . For example, the products of two of the genes mutated in Parkinson's disease \u2014 parkin and ubiquitin carboxy-terminal hydrolase L1 \u2014 are components of the ubiquitin\u2013proteasome system (UPS) that degrades damaged or misfolded proteins. Moreover, duplication or triplication of the normal alpha-synuclein gene causes Parkinson's disease, and overexpression of alpha-synuclein inhibits UPS function. Together, this evidence strongly implicates dysfunction of UPS in the development of Parkinson's disease. Other single-gene mutations point to Parkinson's disease being associated with defects in mitochondria \u2014 the organelles that carry out respiration in the cell. Chemicals that inhibit the mitochondrial \u2018complex I\u2019 can reproduce many features of Parkinson's disease in experimental systems 5 . The mitochondrial hypothesis of Parkinson's disease was put on even firmer footing with the discoveries of causative mutations in the  DJ-1  and  PINK1  genes. The DJ-1 protein has a role in the oxidative stress response; under oxidative conditions, some of the cellular DJ-1 moves to mitochondria where its function remains to be elucidated. The PINK1 protein is found primarily in mitochondria, and it is predicted to be a kinase (an enzyme that adds phosphate groups to other proteins), although its substrates are unknown 6 . So, it looked as though there was the beginning of a nice, neat parcelling of two distinct mechanisms that cause Parkinson's disease: UPS dysfunction and mitochondrial impairment. Of course, things are rarely so simple, and the first inkling that things were not quite as they seemed came from studies showing that overexpression of parkin in cultured cells delays toxin-induced mitochondrial dysfunction 7  and that fruitflies that lack the  parkin  gene have prominent mitochondrial abnormalities in many tissues 8 . Mitochondrial defects were also observed in parkin-deficient mice and humans 9 , 10 . Why would loss of this protein cause mitochondrial dysfunction? Now Clark  et al . 2  and Park  et al . 3  raise additional questions about what parkin is \u2014 or isn't \u2014 doing to cause Parkinson's disease, although the primary focus of these papers is the  PINK1  gene. Both papers show that fruitflies bearing mutations in the fly version of  PINK1  display degeneration of flight muscles and defective sperm formation. Using a combination of biochemical and imaging approaches, these researchers further report that mitochondrial defects accompany both of these abnormalities. Park  et al . 3  also report that the  PINK1 -mutant flies show loss of dopamine neurons \u2014 a type of neuron known to degenerate in Parkinson's disease \u2014 with an accompanying mitochondrial swelling. Although the specific tissues affected by loss of PINK1 function differ in flies and humans, the fact that each of the tissues affected by  PINK1  mutations in the fruitfly has mitochondrial defects strongly suggests that the neurodegeneration in humans with  PINK1  mutations is also caused by mitochondrial dysfunction. This finding is interesting, but not unexpected. The real surprise and importance of these papers is the finding that parkin seems to act downstream from PINK1 in a common pathway that influences mitochondrial integrity. Indeed, the strikingly similar characteristics of the  PINK1 - and  parkin -mutant fruitflies, including flight-muscle degeneration, sperm-formation defects and mitochondrial abnormalities, alone argue that these two genes act in a common pathway. Moreover, both papers show that overexpression of parkin compensates for a lack of PINK1, preventing the effects of the  PINK1  mutation. However, PINK1 overexpression does not detectably influence the characteristics of the  parkin  mutants. Both papers also show that  PINK1 \u2013 parkin  double mutants have symptoms that are indistinguishable from those seen in the single mutants. By contrast, the  DJ-1 -mutant fruitflies are quite different from  parkin  and  PINK1  mutants, suggesting that DJ-1 influences different pathways. Interestingly, the similarities between the  PINK1 - and  parkin -mutant fruitflies parallel a recent clinical study showing that in humans  PINK1  and  parkin  mutations can produce similar symptoms 11 . What is the nature of the pathway regulated by PINK1 and parkin? The simplest inter-pretation of the data is that PINK1 decreases parkin abundance by reducing the level of parkin messenger RNA or protein. Alternatively, PINK1 may phosphorylate parkin and directly influence its activity. However, a problem with the latter model is that most data suggest that PINK1 protein resides primarily in mitochondria and that parkin lies outside mitochondria. Nevertheless, it remains possible that the localization of either parkin or PINK1 changes upon stress, and there are several reports, including that from Park  et al . 3 , that have argued that at least some parkin associates with mitochondria. Another model to explain the current findings is that PINK1-induced mitochondrial impairment leads to secondary dysfunction of the UPS, which can be ameliorated by over-expression of parkin. Parkin, a component of the UPS, is thought to act as a ubiquitin E3 ligase, an enzyme that directs proteins destined for destruction to the proteasome by tagging them with a ubiquitin group. In this regard, there is evidence that parkin mutations are associated with complex I defects 10  and that complex I defects can inhibit the UPS in animal models of Parkinson's disease 12 . Finally, it remains possible that parkin has a functional role in mitochondria that does not involve its ubiquitin-ligase activity. Although there is substantial evidence  in vitro  that parkin can work as a ubiquitin ligase, few of the reported substrates of parkin have been validated  in vivo.  Furthermore, there is evidence that parkin can regulate the biogenesis of mitochondria 13 . Future experiments to delineate the PINK1\u2013parkin pathway should clarify the mechanisms underlying neuro-degeneration in Parkinson's disease and shed light on some very basic questions of mitochondrial biology.

Isaacs"}], "parsed_as_year": "2006_or_before", "body": "Startling three-dimensional images of nanoparticles have been obtained with an X-ray microscope, showing crystal deformation in unprecedented detail. The trick is not to focus the X-rays, but to diffract them. Imagine an imaging device with resolution more than 1,000 times better than an optical microscope and capable of seeing deep inside objects. Such is the promise of an X-ray microscope, which has been the dream of scientists since X-rays were discovered over a century ago. On  page 63  of this issue 1 , Ian Robinson and colleagues present a significant step towards realizing this dream, using the technique of coherent X-ray diffraction imaging. Their results demonstrate the power of X-ray microscopy to create three-dimensional images at the nanoscale, and indicate a clear path towards the ultimate X-ray microscope with atomic-scale resolution. There is an acute need in nanotechnology for images with atomic-scale resolution. Because nanoparticles consist of relatively few atoms, their mechanical, electrical and thermodynamic behaviours are mainly determined by the particles' surfaces and interfaces with other materials, by defects such as those caused by atomic vacancies or non-native atoms, and by deformation of the atomic crystal lattice, known as strain. For example, nanoparticles of gold, which consist of just thousands of atoms, are excellent catalysts for certain chemical reactions, even though bulk gold is essentially inert 2 . Semiconductor nanocrystals, known as quantum dots, have electronic and optical behaviour that can be tuned by binding a single molecule to their surface 3 . To develop materials with useful properties, we must first understand how these properties relate to atomic structure and surface chemistry. Electron microscopes are ubiquitous in materials science, but X-ray microscopes are emerging as an attractive alternative, for two reasons. First, the penetrating power of X-rays into materials allows us to quantitatively determine the full three-dimensional structure of nanoparticles, usually non-destructively. High-resolution electron microscopy often requires samples to be thinned to several atomic layers. This is technically challenging for many materials and can alter the properties being studied. Embedded nanostructures can best be studied with X-rays. Second, bright synchrotron sources of \u2018hard\u2019 X-rays \u2014 those with a wavelength shorter than 0.1 nm \u2014 have become readily available. This has enabled the development of X-ray optics with improved resolving power. So far, microscopes based on Fresnel zone plates (which focus light by diffraction) or mirror optics have produced the highest resolution (about 40-nm) hard X-ray images. But the optics used by these methods are technologically challenging to make 4 , 5 . Coherent X-ray imaging, which uses in-phase X-rays, offers a \u2018lens-less\u2019 alternative. When coherent X-rays irradiate an object, the scattered radiation forms a pattern. In contrast to the scattering produced with incoherent X-rays, the coherent pattern contains not only information about the amplitude of the scattered radiation, but also information about the phase of that radiation, provided that the pattern is sufficiently \u2018oversampled\u2019 6 . Oversampling is a well-established technique used to ensure proper retrieval of phase information from the scattered radiation. Crucially, the phase information allows the pattern to be mathematically \u2018inverted\u2019 to recover an image of the charge-density distribution of the object. One significant feature of coherent-diffraction imaging is its high sensitivity to crystallographic strain \u2014 that is, to deviations of atoms from their nominal bulk positions. Coherent X-ray imaging was proposed in the early 1980s as a means to visualize the electron-density distribution in non-crystalline materials 7 , and was first demonstrated in 1999 (ref.  8 ). Two years later, the technique was used by Robinson  et al . 9  on a crystalline system.  Figure 1  shows an example of the coherent diffraction pattern from a 160-nm silver cube, observed in previous work by Robinson and colleagues 10 , 11 . The four symmetric streaks are signatures of the cubic facets. These streaks are produced by sharply terminated surfaces and could be formed with incoherent X-rays. Coherence is, however, required to produce the periodic modulation of the streaks. The modulation is an interference pattern created by X-rays coherently scattered from opposing sides of the cubes, much like the interference pattern in the classic two-slit experiment of Thomas Young. This pattern was inverted to create an image of the cube 10 , 11 . Robinson and colleagues 1  have now applied their technique to more complicated structures. They collected the coherent diffraction pattern from 750-nm hemispherical lead nanoparticles that had small faceted faces. The pattern was then inverted by applying computational techniques developed by the authors, to obtain a full three-dimensional image of the electron-density distribution in the particles. A truly remarkable aspect of this image is the clear articulation of a deformation of the lattice, known as a strain field (see Figs 3 and 4 of ref.  1 ). When contour maps of the mag-nitude of the strain are plotted, it becomes apparent that the strain field originates from a point just outside the lead particle, in the region of contact with the glass substrate upon which the particle was grown. This strongly supports the authors' claim that the strain field is caused by interfacial contact forces between the particle and the substrate. These forces can be associated with a single defect that may have been the nucleation point for the growth of the nanocrystal. By creating a lens-less image of the strain fields in a lead nanoparticle with 40-nm spatial resolution, Robinson and co-workers have taken a substantial step forward in realizing the potential of X-ray microscopes. One can envisage even greater uses, for instance imaging the strain field near a single atomic defect inside a semiconductor quantum dot. Such applications will require significant improvements in detectors and a much higher flux of coherent X-rays, which will become available with future generations of hard X-ray sources, such as the X-ray Free Electron Laser. With these advances, the dream of a microscope capable of imaging the position and type of every atom in a nanocrystal or macromolecular assembly could become a reality. Reprints and Permissions"},

Clad in hard hat, headlamp and battery belt, he would join 50 other 'first shifters' for a pre-dawn ride a mile into the Earth. A labyrinth of hot, dimly lit tunnels greeted the riders, but Davis knew his way, having retraced it some 700 times. Turning to the right, he headed towards the tunnel with the bright lights. At the end, beneath those lights, was a 380,000-litre tank. This was where he did his mining. While his companions blasted tonnes of granite in search of gold, Davis sifted through 600 tonnes of cleaning fluid for a dozen special atoms \u2014 much more interesting to him than gold. His was the more difficult task. No mining engineer would accept the odds \u2014 find 10 atoms in a sea of 10 31  \u2014 nor would workers a third his age long want to keep pace. He spent 15 hours a day underground each time he came to Homestake and, consequently, often wouldn't see the Sun. However, if you asked him about it, he would laugh, flash a broad smile and say, \u201cI'm watching the Sun all the time!\u201d Ray Davis, who died on 31 May, had indeed been watching the Sun in a new and interesting way since 1967. By doing so, he helped discover something unexpected in particle physics. It was in the late 1930s that Hans Bethe provided the first rigorous explanation of why the Sun shines. Nuclear reactions in the core fuse hydrogen into heavier elements, with light being the most obvious (but not the only) by-product. Another particle, the neutrino, was also produced and, unlike light, travelled virtually unhindered from the solar interior. Wolfgang Pauli postulated this particle in 1930 to preserve several sacred laws of physics, but in the same breath dismissed it as probably undetectable given its tiny cross-section and resulting elusive nature. His worry was unfounded. In the 1950s, Fred Reines and Clyde Cowan saw signs of this poltergeist at the Savannah River reactor, an intense source of (anti)neutrinos. Davis also began his neutrino work at reactors. He had earned a PhD at Yale, served in the army during the war, and worked briefly as a radiochemist at Monsanto, before joining the newly created Brookhaven National Laboratory in 1948 \u2014 his home for the next 37 years. When he asked the chemistry department chairman for his assignment, he was told to go to the library and find something interesting to work on. He did. A review paper on neutrinos caught his eye, as did a technical brief by Bruno Pontecorvo. Pontecorvo proposed a way of detecting neutrinos using a chlorine-containing liquid. The idea was that a neutrino would be captured on a particular chlorine isotope ( 37 Cl), changing it into a radioactive argon atom ( 37 Ar), which could be removed from the liquid and counted. Davis fleshed out the scheme, developing the extraction, gas handling and counting hardware needed to make it work. He constructed a 3,800-litre detector and looked for argon production at both the Brookhaven and Savannah River reactors. He found none \u2014 not because of any experimental failings, but because of his emerging finding that neutrinos and antineutrinos were different \u2014 at least with respect to capture on  37 Cl. In 1960, he began thinking about a grander challenge \u2014 detecting neutrinos from the Sun. In this quest, Davis found an able guide in John Bahcall. Bahcall, a theorist, began calculating neutrino emissions from the Sun and their capture rate on chlorine. Davis was proposing a scaled-up 380,000-litre detector filled with C 2 Cl 4  (a dry-cleaning fluid). Bahcall predicted that, of the more than 10 22  neutrinos transiting this detector each week, about 10 would be captured, creating 10 argon atoms a week. Though small, it was a rate that Davis thought he could measure. Not one to make an idle boast, he had been working to improve the technologies for this large-scale detector and to understand its background. From earlier measurements, he knew that his detector would have to be deep underground to shield it from cosmic rays. After a brief search for a site, the detector was built at the Homestake Gold Mine in South Dakota from 1965 to 1967. A problem arose almost immediately when data started arriving. Davis's measurements were about a third of Bahcall's prediction. In spite of more refined calculations and more data, the discrepancy remained. Dubbed the 'solar neutrino problem', it persisted for 20 years. Davis and his experiment remained in the crosshairs the entire time. He was challenged repeatedly \u2014 about efficiencies, chemical traps, pump changes, and the like \u2014 but he faced all questioners with his trademark candour, graciousness and wit. He brought technical precision and thoroughness to his answers, recounting the many careful, quantitative tests he had performed to address each concern. He had deep humility, but also quiet confidence in his experimental skills \u2014 which were formidable. Beginning in the late 1980s, other experiments came online. They confirmed the problem. In the end, a versatile detector in Canada resolved it, showing that neither Bahcall's calculation nor Davis's mining was mistaken. Instead, neutrinos from the Sun were changing 'flavour' en route to Earth. This unexpected result meant that neutrinos, formerly thought to be massless, necessarily had some \u2014 a finding that required revision of the standard model of particle physics and gave these mysterious messengers a mass on a par with all visible matter in the Universe. In 2002, Davis won the Nobel Prize in Physics. His wife of 54 years, Anna, and 21 other Davises accompanied him to Stockholm. Then 88 and battling Alzheimer's, Ray received an additional honour. Nobel protocol ordinarily requires each recipient to walk to the centre of the stage to receive their prize. However, on this occasion the King of Sweden came in person to a laureate. The gold that Davis had never sought, never mined for, found him that day. Those of us who worked alongside Ray Davis, at Brookhaven and later at the University of Pennsylvania, saw up-close a great experimentalist \u2014 heroically persistent, patiently tenacious and meticulously precise. But we saw an even greater human being \u2014 one whose kindness, warmth and modesty were even more remarkable. Reprints and Permissions"},

So how do these accretion disks work? The answer, it seems, is blowing in their winds. Astronomical objects that siphon off their energy from gravitational processes are the most powerful sources of electromagnetic radiation in the Universe. Of these, quasi-stellar radio sources (quasars), which can release as much power as several hundred galaxies, are perhaps the most spectacular example. But for all their brightness, gravity-powered sources are secretive when it comes to revealing how exactly they produce their radiation. On  page 953  of this issue, Miller  et al . 1  investigate a system known as GRO J1655\u201340, in which a black hole of seven solar masses accretes gas stripped from a normal star. They observe not just radiation, but a wind of ionized gas emerging from the system, and conclude that a magnetic process powers this wind \u2014 and that this process could also play the lead part in producing the radiation. For astronomers, gravity is not just the seemingly all-conquering force of everyday experience, but also the ultimate source of energy. In a star depleted of nuclear fuel, for instance, gravity prevails to form a very dense, compact object. Depending on the star's initial mass, this object could be a white dwarf, a neutron star or a black hole. When rotating gas is fed to such a compact object, as for example in GRO J1655\u201340, its mass is converted to radiation with an efficiency of a few per cent. That climbs to 40% for a rapidly rotating black hole \u2014 values significantly higher than the 1% conversion efficiency for nuclear fusion 2 . So how do these cosmic engines work? Initially, the falling gas forms a thin, dense \u2018accretion disk\u2019 that encircles the compact object and is supported against gravitational collapse by centrifugal force. Through viscous damping processes within the disk, the mechanical energy of the gas is dissipated and radiated away as continuum emission over all wavelengths. That much is understood; what is unclear, however, is how exactly the mechanical energy is converted into heat and radiation energy. Moreover, for gas to accrete throughout the centrifugally supported disk, conservation of angular momentum requires a mechanism that transfers the gas's angular momentum rapidly outwards. Otherwise, the gas would orbit the central object forever, and no radiation would be produced. For decades, hydrodynamic processes were thought to supply this mechanism. But despite some successes \u2014 such as obtaining an understanding of the role of turbulence in disk dynamics \u2014 the hydrodynamical approach has so far not produced a consistent model that can be derived from first principles 3 , 4 . Only a turbulent disk with interacting eddies will supply an effective viscosity large enough to drive the fast accretion rates observed in disks; but the question of what powers the turbulence remains unanswered. In this context, the introduction of magnetic fields, presumed to originate in the star feeding the compact object, pays off handsomely. This applies even to small fields that are hard to measure directly: through an effect known as magneto-rotational instability 5 , a weak magnetic field can act as a kind of spring connecting inner and outer areas of gas in the disk. This spring exerts a force that transfers angular momentum and energy outwards and extracts disk rotational energy to power turbulence 4 . Miller and colleagues 1  find indirect evidence to support this theory in the properties of a wind driven from the accretion disk of GRO J1655\u201340. They studied an X-ray spectrum of the system taken by NASA's Chandra satellite observatory and detected tens of spectral absorption lines shifted towards shorter wavelengths. Such a \u2018blueshift\u2019 indicates that absorbing gas is moving towards the observer and, using geometrical and physical arguments, Miller  et al . conclude that the absorbing medium is a wind blowing outwards from the accretion disk at a small angle to the disk's plane. The fact that the wind is blowing from the disk and not, for example, from the companion star means that the wind's properties can reveal the properties of the disk itself. To produce such a wind, the upper disk atmosphere must gain extra energy to overcome gravity. This extra energy can come from heating, from radiation pressure, from magnetic fields or from any combination of the three 3 , 6 , 7 . In many systems, it is hard to distinguish which of these dominates. Happily, Miller  et al . argue 1 , the GRO J1655\u201340 case is clear-cut. In this system, the wind is too cold for its thermal pressure to overcome gravity, and the radiation pressure is too weak to drive a wind. Thus, by a process of elimination, a magnetic origin for the wind is the only option. This is an attractive possibility, as theories exist that posit magnetic fields as the drivers of disk accretion in the first place 7 , 8 , and a larger mystery would therefore also be solved. Not all might find Miller and colleagues' arguments for magnetic fields as the drivers of disk accretion convincing, partly because they rely on evidence that is mostly indirect. But this is the best that can be done at the moment: current models lack the predictive power to demonstrate that magnetic fields power the wind and disk accretion that are responsible, respectively, for the observed absorption lines and continuum emission. Nevertheless, many astronomers will be motivated by such work to develop and explore this promising model. Clearly, much can be learned about accretion disks by studying the properties of what escapes them \u2014 not only radiation, but gas, too. Reprints and Permissions"},

The death of Bruce Merrifield on 14 May 2006 brings to a close the life of one of the most original scientists of the second half of the twentieth century. Between 1959 and 1963, Merrifield revolutionized organic chemistry by his invention of solid-phase peptide synthesis. This \u201csimple and ingenious\u201d technique, as it was described in the citation for Merrifield's 1984 Nobel Prize in Chemistry, created a paradigm shift in synthetic chemistry and profoundly affected biomedical research. Robert Bruce Merrifield was born in Fort Worth, Texas, on 15 July 1921, the only son of George and Lorene (Lucas) Merrifield. He obtained his PhD in 1949 from the University of California, Los Angeles. Immediately after graduating, Merrifield joined the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research in New York, where he spent his entire career. He became professor in 1966, and was elected to the US National Academy of Sciences in 1972. At the Rockefeller Institute, Merrifield worked with D. Wayne Woolley on nucleotide biochemistry, and then on the identification and chemical synthesis of putative peptide growth factors. This was the period shortly after the Second World War, when chemists worldwide were devising methods for the preparation of biologically active peptides. These molecules were important targets for organic synthesis, because they constituted a new class of natural product. Synthetic techniques had improved rapidly, but were still rather cumbersome. Using the available chemistries, Merrifield prepared a series of synthetic peptides containing up to seven amino acids, a process that took five years of laborious research. On 26 May 1959, Merrifield wrote in his laboratory notebook: \u201cThere is a need for a rapid, quantitative, automatic method for the synthesis of long chain peptides.\u201d He then outlined the principles of a radically new approach to chemical peptide synthesis. Four years later, Merrifield published a seminal paper, entitled \u201cSolid Phase Peptide Synthesis. I. The Synthesis of a Tetrapeptide\u201d in the  Journal of the American Chemical Society . The solid-phase method consisted of chemically attaching the last amino acid of the target peptide to a solid support, then carrying out all the chemical steps necessary to build the peptide's amino-acid sequence, and finally releasing the product from the support. As Merrifield envisaged it, solid-phase synthesis would greatly facilitate the preparation of peptides by enabling the recovery of support-bound intermediate products by simple filtration and washing; in turn, this would enable the use of excess reactants at each step, giving rapid reactions and high yields of the final peptide product. From the start, Merrifield had also envisaged the automation of chemical synthesis. By 1965 he had implemented this idea in collaboration with John Stewart, a faculty colleague. With Nils Jernberg of the machine shop at the Rockefeller University (as it was known by then), they built an automated synthesizer that could prepare peptides 20 times faster than solution methods, and that allowed the preparation of longer peptide chains. Solid-phase peptide synthesis was quickly adopted throughout the world, and was used to make numerous analogues of biologically active peptides. Merrifield and his young colleagues concentrated on developing the technique and extending it to new targets. But as solid-phase synthesis was applied to ever-larger molecules, established peptide researchers harshly criticized both Merrifield and his method. It was felt, as a matter of principle, that a technique that prevented the full characterization of synthetic intermediates could not give rise to authentic peptide products. The objections of traditional chemists were ultimately refuted by the systematic development of improved solid-phase synthetic chemistry in Merrifield's and other laboratories during the 1970s and 1980s, and by the emergence of powerful analytical techniques for determining the structure and purity of synthetic peptides. The solid-phase method is now used routinely for the chemical synthesis of peptides and proteins up to 50 or so amino acids in length. Today, the discovery of vast numbers of potent peptide natural products is leading to a resurgence in pharmaceutical research on peptides. Solid-phase synthesis is the unrivalled technique for the preparation of such compounds in order to determine the chemical basis of their biological function. Merrifield's ingenious concept led directly to the development of efficient methods for preparing synthetic nucleic acids \u2014 essential for modern molecular biology and biotechnology. The solid-phase principle is also at the heart of combinatorial chemistry, which enables the simultaneous preparation of thousands of compounds, and which has changed the fabric of medicinal chemistry and drug discovery since the early 1990s. Bruce Merrifield is survived by Libby, his wife of 56 years, their six children and sixteen grandchildren. He was a devoted family man who loved hiking and camping with his family. In the last 45 years of his life, Merrifield was afflicted with a progressive skin cancer \u2014 apparently the result of radiation treatment for acne in his youth. A man of extraordinary resilience, Merrifield bore this devastating illness with grace and fortitude. In his later years, he nursed his wife back to health after she suffered a serious stroke. In the 1960s and 1970s, the Merrifield laboratory was a hotbed of new peptide science. Those who were fortunate enough to work with Bruce came to know a man who was devoted to the Rockefeller University, to his research group, and to intellectually rigorous science. His unique approach to his discipline was recounted in an excellent autobiographical memoir,  Life During a Golden Age of Peptide Chemistry  (American Chemical Society, 1993). By creating a completely new approach to organic synthesis, Merrifield pioneered the effective application of synthetic chemistry to the study of biological molecules. His scientific creativity has been equalled by few and rarely surpassed. Reprints and Permissions"},

McMillan"}], "parsed_as_year": "2006_or_before", "body": "Carbon is unusual in its family of elements because it has gaseous oxides. But under high pressure, carbon dioxide forms crystalline solids and can become a glass \u2014 so revealing the chemical family resemblance. Everyone is familiar with the common forms of silicon dioxide (SiO 2 , silica), such as the crystalline version known as quartz, the major component of sand. When melted and cooled rapidly, and usually mixed with metal oxides, sand forms silica-based glasses that we use to make many useful things, ranging from windows to champagne bottles. A glassy dioxide of germanium (GeO 2 , germania) is also known, and is added to the kilometre-long silica glassy fibres used in optical telecommunications, to control their refractive index. Carbon belongs to the same family of elements as silicon and germanium, but carbon dioxide (CO 2 , carbonia) glass has remained a theoretical possibility. On  page 857  of this issue, however, Santoro and colleagues 1  show that carbonia glass can be made when a high-density form of solid CO 2  is melted and cooled under high-pressure conditions. Carbon, silicon and germanium are the first three members of group IV of the periodic table, which also includes the heavier elements tin and lead. These last two elements form both monoxides and dioxides, which have been used as pigments since ancient times 2 . In contrast, only the dioxides of silicon and germanium occur as stable solids. Once we reach carbon, the lightest member of the series, we find that both carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide are stable molecules, but these exist as gases at ambient temperature and pressure. As we rise up a group of the periodic table, such anomalous jumps in the properties of compounds formed from the elements of that group often occur. Smooth changes in chemical and physical properties are generally observed among the heavier members of the group, but the lightest element behaves quite differently. Carbon dioxide is a linear molecule with strong carbon\u2013oxygen double bonds. Freezing or high-pressure treatment condenses this gas into solid forms, in which the molecules remain intact, even under extreme pressurization to 80 GPa at ambient temperature 3 . Recently, however, experiments showed that under simultaneous high-pressure and high-temperature conditions, CO 2  molecules undergo bond-breaking and re-formation reactions, producing a three-dimensional network of polymerized tetrahedral CO 4  units. This network is analogous to the crystalline silica structures found in minerals such as cristobalite, tridymite or quartz 4 , 5 , although it reverts to solids containing CO 2  molecules at pressures below 1 GPa. Other nitrogen- and oxygen-containing molecules also undergo solid-state chemistry at high pressure 6 . These results have generated great excitement among chemists. The newly prepared materials might have useful properties for technological applications. Studies on the polymeric, silica-like form of CO 2  suggest that it is \u2018super-hard\u2019 and that it is an optically nonlinear material \u2014 for example, it causes doubling of the frequency of light from a laser 4 , 5 . The discovery also has implications for geochemistry, because the conditions found in Earth's mantle could induce the formation of these newly discovered forms of carbon oxides. Incorporation of CO 2  into solid-state compounds formed under high temperature and pressure may even lead to methods for disposal of this environmentally problematic gas. So, a crystalline silica-like form of CO 2  has been made, but how about a glassy version? Enter Santoro and colleagues 1 , who have prepared a dense, polymeric amorphous form of this compound that is analogous to silica- and germania-based glasses. They did this by compressing molecular solid CO 2  to pressures of 40\u201365 GPa with heating, then cooling it to ambient temperature. Their result is at least as exciting as the discovery of the polymeric crystalline carbon dioxide solid, and the chemistry of carbonia-based glasses is now open for exploration. So far, glassy carbonia is like its crystalline equivalent in that it is not yet recoverable to ambient conditions, preventing further study of its physical properties. During decompression from the conditions under which it is formed, the glass transforms back to an amorphous version of molecular solid CO 2 . Developing carbonia glasses that can be recovered to ambient conditions will be one of the first challenges for future research. These results 1  have implications for liquid-state physics, and inform us about the conditions under which CO 2  undergoes various phase transitions, including melting 7 . There has been much discussion of the newly recognized phenomenon of polyamorphism \u2014 the ability of a material to exist in several different amorphous forms \u2014 and of phase transitions between distinct liquid states of a single substance. These are driven by density or entropy changes between glassy or liquid forms at constant chemical composition 8 . It has been suggested that such transitions occur for many liquids and glasses, including water, silica and germania. The observation by Santoro  et al . 1  that, upon decompression, glassy carbonia transforms from a dense amorphous solid containing networks of single bonds, to an amorphous solid containing molecular CO 2 , represents a dramatic example of polyamorphic behaviour, analogous to that observed for amorphous silicon or liquid phosphorus 9 , 10 . It follows that anomalies are to be expected in the melting behaviour of crystalline CO 2  solids, or that a phase transition may occur in the liquid state at high pressure, between the molecular and the polymeric forms. The discovery of mineral-like polymeric and ionic solids that form at high pressure, based on the light elements carbon, oxygen and nitrogen, opens up a new area in solid-state chemistry. Carbonia-based minerals and glasses could give rise to useful technological materials, if we can recover them to ambient conditions. These findings will also help set the rules for understanding structure, bonding and thermodynamic properties as we move our experiments into the high-pressure, high-temperature conditions mimicking those deep inside planetary interiors.

To this end, David Kaplan and colleagues have created a fusion protein that combines spider silk protein and a peptide (R5) that helps to deposit the silicate skeletons of microoorganisms called diatoms ( Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA  doi:10.1073/pnas.0601096103). In diatom biosilicates, the organic protein component improves the toughness of the inorganic silicon, and allows fine control of the microstructure \u2014 giving complex skeletons that are produced under mild aqueous conditions. Spider silk, on the other hand, is renowned for its tensile strength and, of particular importance for this study, can assemble itself from its constituent units. Silk assembly can be manipulated experimentally to produce many structures, from the threads seen in nature, to films, gels and porous matrices. Silk studded with cell-binding domains or other biologically active molecules can even be made, to encourage the formation of tissues such as bone or cartilage. Kaplan and colleagues cast their silk\u2013R5 fusion protein into films or spun it into fibres, depositing silica by adding a silicon solution during or after the process. They obtained spherical silica structures 0.5\u20132 \u03bcm in diameter (the picture shows silica deposited on a silk\u2013R5 film; scale bar 2 \u03bcm). The strength and resilience of the silk\u2013silica structures have not been tested, but the work shows in principle that they can be produced in different forms, for instance as silk fibres coated entirely in silica. The authors hope that their fusion strategy could produce a variety of composite materials. By adjusting the proteins involved, it might be possible to direct the deposition of titanium dioxide rather than silica, say. Reprints and Permissions"},

As William E. Friedman reports in this issue ( Nature   441 , 337\u2013340; 2006), its red fruits, shown here, contain a relic of what seems to have been a period of intense evolutionary experimentation in early angiosperm history. In nearly all angiosperms, the female gametophyte \u2014 egg-producing structure \u2014 is a sac containing seven cells and eight nuclei (see Fig. 1 of the paper on page 337). Apart from the egg cell itself, which is fertilized to become the embryo, a so-called central cell is fertilized to become the supporting tissue or endosperm. These are the elements required for the phenomenon of double fertilization unique to angiosperms. Making up the numbers are three antipodal cells and two synergids \u2014 sterile cells that accompany the egg. Amborella  dares to be different, and has one extra synergid. This may seem a trifling matter, but it is akin to finding a fossil amphibian with an extra leg: the developmental ramifications are equally important, for Friedman's detailed examination of  Amborella  development shows that the egg cell is \u2014 uniquely \u2014 a lineal sister of a synergid, rather than a mitotic sister of one of the nuclei of the central cell. These findings add to the oddities of other relics of early angiosperm evolution, such as water lilies (Nymphaeales) whose mature female gametophytes contain only four cells. The major lineages of angiosperms are believed to have become established in an interval of around 15 million years, 130 million years ago.  Amborella  and other living fossils offer an immensely valuable window into how the reproductive structures of flowering plants evolved. Reprints and Permissions"},

This apparently incompatible combination of strength and thinness is a result of the film's hybrid composition. It consists of an organic polymeric network, which makes it pliable and deformable, interpenetrated by zirconia (zirconium dioxide), which confers strength and stability. To prepare the nanofilm, the two materials are generated simultaneously from their precursors on a spin-coating plate. The chemical processes involved are quite different: the polymer forms by light-induced crosslinking of its monomers, whereas the zirconium precursor reacts with residual traces of water in the film's polyvinyl alcohol substrate. Nevertheless, the components intertwine to give nanofilms with properties that make them useful as sensors, actuators and separation membranes. Reprints and Permissions"},

But why are these plumes where they are? In this issue, Francis Nimmo and Robert T. Pappalardo ( Nature   441 , 614\u2013616; 2006) show that the spout's polar location could, theoretically, be explained by the formation of a diapir, an upwelling region of low-density material, in Enceladus' interior. Simple gravitational considerations require that the moon swings round so that this less weighty, tectonically active region is aligned with the moon's axis of rotation \u2014 and so ends up at the pole. There are caveats. The authors show that if the diapir is within Enceladus' subsurface ice shell, then the moon's outermost layer, or lithosphere, must be relatively rigid. Otherwise, the upwelling material would simply bulge out from the surface. That region would then tend to migrate not towards the poles, but towards the moon's equator. A diapir within Enceladus' silicate core, on the other hand, would cause a poleward reorientation. But it would preclude the existence of a global subsurface ocean: such an ocean would decouple the core gravitationally from the ice shell, preventing reorientation. Nimmo and Pappalardo's low-density diapir should be detectable through its effect on the moon's gravity field. Further analysis of data returned by radio instruments aboard Cassini should provide a conclusive test for its existence. Reprints and Permissions"},

As Peter H. Tsang and colleagues report ( Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA   103,  5764\u20135768; 2006 ), the bacterium's long, tail-like anchor sticks it so tightly to a supporting surface that it often tears apart when a detaching force is applied, rather than relinquishing its grip. The adhesion is thought to be the strongest of biological origin yet discovered. When  C. crescentus  (two are pictured here, spawning clones) is in its non-motile (stuck) state, its anchor \u2014 appropriately named its \u2018holdfast\u2019 \u2014 binds the bacterium to the surface, and a stalk connects the holdfast to the cell body. The authors used atomic force microscopy to record the force needed to detach a non-motile cell from a micropipette by means of a suction pipette oriented perpendicular to the pulling direction. They measured the area of coverage of the holdfast and other dimensions of the bacterium, working out average geometries and finally applying a mathematical technique known as finite-element analysis to calculate the adhesion strength. The holdfast enables the bacterium to remain stuck to the surface even in strong jets of water, and Tsang  et al . calculate that, were it to cover an area of 1 cm 2 , it could support a weight of 680 kg, even on a wet surface. That exceeds all other known cell-adhesion capabilities \u2014 including the sticking power of the much-studied gecko's foot. And because, owing to the geometry of  C. crescentus , the adhesion often failed through fracture of the cell stalk rather than at the adhesion interface, the true adhesion strength at the interface could be still higher. Polymers of a sugar-based molecule called  N -acetylglucosamine are known to be present in the bacterium's adhesive plaque. The authors found that when they treated the polymers with an enzyme to break them down, the strength of the bacterial attachment was reduced. However, the detailed physical and chemical mechanisms of  C. crescentus 's adhesive abilities remain to be revealed. Their elucidation could trigger the development of a new range of synthetic adhesives. Reprints and Permissions"},

A new form of polymer turns that relation on its head. The fact that the polymer polyacetylene reaches metallic levels of conductivity when chemically doped caused quite a stir when it was first reported 1  in 1977. This was not just because conducting polymers might be of great practical use, but also because the underlying physics came as a surprise: the apparently free movement of electrons along the carbon-based backbone of a polymer chain was not widely anticipated. The discovery attracted the attention of many chemists, materials scientists and physicists, and by the mid-1990s several practical conducting polymeric materials had emerged. Despite their metal-like conductivities, these polymers did not pass muster as metals in other important respects. On  page 65  of this issue, Lee  et al . 2  supply missing evidence that supports the prevailing view that it is structural disorder, which is very hard to eliminate in polymeric materials, that prevents making real metals of polymers 3 , 4 . The authors' doped, conducting form of polyaniline, synthesized to produce a more ordered material than was previously available, shows both the electrical and the optical properties required of a true metal. Although the electrical conductivity of this form of polyaniline is, at about 10 3  siemens per centimetre at room temperature, not particularly high (the conductivity of copper at the same temperature is, for instance, around 6\u00d710 5  S cm \u22121 ), it increases steadily as temperature is lowered, and by 4 kelvin has risen by a factor of about 2.5. Such behaviour is a hallmark of a metal: the conduction electrons that carry the electrical current within a metal travel as free particles, and it is the rate at which these electrons are scattered that limits conductivity. Because the dominant source of scattering is the thermal vibrational motions of the atoms, as temperature falls, scattering is frozen out, and so conductivity increases. At very low temperatures, the conductivity saturates at a level set by scattering due to residual disorder. Another defining feature of a metal is its optical reflectivity, which gives, for instance, silver and aluminium their familiar shine. Light is reflected from a metallic surface when its frequency lies below the characteristic oscillation frequency (the \u2018plasma frequency\u2019,  \u03c9 p ) of electrons in a metal. (This frequency is given by the expression  \u03c9 p 2  =  ne 2 / \u025bm , where  n  is the number density of conduction electrons,  m  the electron mass and  \u025b  is the background dielectric constant.) In this case, conduction electrons are able to move fast enough to screen out incident electromagnetic radiation and, mathematically, the real part of the complex dielectric response function of a metal is negative. For metals with high densities of conduction electrons such as silver and aluminium, the plasma frequency lies above the frequency band of visible light, in the ultraviolet region of the electromagnetic spectrum. For Lee and colleagues' conducting form of polyaniline 2 , however, the density of conduction electrons is much lower, and the plasma frequency is deep in the infrared, below visible-light frequencies. Polyaniline does not therefore seem to reflect visible light, as a metal does; nevertheless, its optical reflectivity in the infrared very accurately fits the model for a simple metal, and, critically, the real part of its dielectric response function remains negative down to the lowest frequencies. In fact, the surprise is just how like an ordinary metal polyaniline turns out to be. Modelling its optical reflectivity assuming that it is a metal produces a realistic estimate of the number of conduction electrons (about one for every two aniline groups in the polymer), requires no adjustment to take into account the electron mass, and gives a value for d.c. conductivity that matches the directly measured value. This finding pitches the metallic model against a different model, loosely referred to as the \u2018polaron model\u2019 5 , that over the past two decades has been the favoured explanation of polymer conductivity. This model starts from the fact that, without chemical doping, polymers such as polyacetylene and polyaniline are semiconductors (as such, they are extensively used as the active component in transistors, light-emitting diodes and photovoltaic diodes 6 ). When a small amount of dopant electronic charge is added to the undoped polymer, the electronic charges on the polymer chain are localized. Thermal excitation is required to move charge from one site to the next, and so conductivity drops as temperature falls. Ironically, the localization that hinders conduction is substantially the handiwork of the agents that produced the charge: the chemical dopants are partially ordered in sites adjacent to the polymer chains (so-called \u2018charge transfer complexes\u2019) and their full-blown ionic charges provide random potentials that confine the electrons. Localization is enhanced by the rearrangement near charges of covalent bonds on the polymer chain. This process produces a lower energy state for electrons to occupy, and the resultant coupling of the local structure to the electronic charge can be regarded as a particle-like entity, known as a polaron. It also causes a set of characteristic optical signatures, including vibrational modes of the polymer structure at frequencies between 15 and 60 terahertz and electronic transitions to states within the semiconductor gap, typically at frequencies in the near infrared. Although there is plenty of spectroscopic evidence to support the polaron model for partially doped materials, polaronic features seem insignificant in Lee and colleagues' more ordered doped polyaniline 2 . The transition from polaronic conductor to simple metal \u2014 from a material whose conductivity, at low temperatures, decreases with falling temperature to one whose conductivity increases \u2014 is surprising. The explanation must lie in the way that conduction electrons are able to screen out the local potentials that stem from both polaron geometrical relaxation and structural disorder. This process is self-perpetuating: as the potentials become screened, the conduction electrons are themselves able to become more delocalized, and thus better able to screen. This phenomenon has parallels in some classes of inorganic materials such as \u2018colossal magnetoresistance\u2019 manganites that can show huge changes in conductivity as their magnetic order changes, and in which the role of polaronic interactions is similarly important 7 . The implications for the field of conducting polymers are bitter-sweet: although the demonstration of a polymer acting as a true metal is a real milestone, it sets a limit on the level of conductivity we can expect from such materials.

Mascola"}], "parsed_as_year": "2006_or_before", "body": "One obstacle to realizing the promise of viral vectors for vaccine delivery is pre-existing immunity to such vectors. An adroit application of structure-based design points to a way around that problem. There are still no vaccines against such devastating and widespread diseases as malaria, tuberculosis and AIDS. Because the traditional approach of live-attenuated vaccination is not feasible for most diseases, scientists have turned to molecularly engineered viruses that contain pathogen-specific gene inserts. Such viral vectors direct host cells to produce the foreign protein of interest, thus prompting a pre-emptive immune response. Among the most promising viral vectors is a form of common-cold virus known as adenovirus serotype 5. The recombinant adenovirus vectors (rAd5) cannot replicate and can be safely administered, and they elicit both of the two main types of immune response \u2014 secreted antibodies and disease-fighting T cells. There is a problem, however. The existing immunity to rAd5 in many adults means that the vector could be neutralized before it can have an effect. Hence the work of Roberts  et al . 1 , described on  page 239  of this issue. They have taken a fresh approach to the molecular engineering of rAd5, one that has the potential to circumvent anti-vector immunity and expand the applicability of such vectors for human vaccination. Numerous viral vectors are being studied for use in gene-based vaccine strategies. The most commonly used vectors are derived from poxviruses, alphaviruses and adenoviruses. Among these, rAd5 is the best characterized and is perhaps the most attractive for vaccine development. As a stand-alone vaccine, rAd5 can elicit different types of T-cell immunity (those due to CD4 and CD8 cells), and more potent immune responses can be achieved with a \u2018prime-boost\u2019 approach. For example, use of vehicles known as DNA plasmids followed by boosting with rAd5 can generate durable antibody and T-cell immune responses 2 , 3 . Preclinical studies of rAd5 vaccines include vaccines against Ebola, SARS, HIV-1 and anthrax 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , and phase II human clinical studies of rAd5 HIV-1 vectors are in progress. But anti-vector immunity may be a serious limitation. Adenovirus serotype 5 is common \u2014 depending on the geographical region of the world, most adults are exposed to it and develop some level of immunity. This may lessen the effectiveness of rAd5 as a vaccine vector. Potential ways around this problem include the use of adenoviruses derived from other human serotypes or from non-human animal species. Indeed, there are more than 50 known human adenoviral serotypes, some of which are quite rare in the human population. The genetic manipulation required to engineer alternative serotypes is not trivial, however. The rAd5 vectors contain specific genetic deletions that render them unable to replicate. This contributes to their safety, but also means that specially engineered cells must be used to produce them. The advantages of rAd5 are that the necessary groundwork has been laid, in terms of basic molecular engineering and production of the vector, and that it has been through the regulatory approval process for use in humans. Adaptation of other serotypes will require a methodical process of research and development, and safety testing. Furthermore, preliminary data 5 , 8  from other serotypes, such as rAd35 and rAd11, suggest that they may be less immunogenic \u2014 that is, less effective in producing immunity \u2014 than rAd5. With this as background, Roberts and colleagues 1  took advantage of our improved understanding of anti-vector immunity, coupled with structural data about viral proteins, to derive a rational approach to re-engineering the rAd5 vector. In adenoviruses, the viral DNA is surrounded by a protein shell called a capsid that contains hexon and penton subunits. Because host antibodies that neutralize rAd5 are directed against the hexon subunit, Roberts  et al . studied the atomic structure of this protein to understand where antibodies would probably bind. Molecular modelling revealed that the seven hypervariable regions (HVRs) of the hexon form the outer surface of the protein, making the HVRs a likely target for antibody binding. By exchanging all seven HVRs of rAd5 with those of the rare adenovirus serotype 48 (Ad48), the authors constructed a chimaeric adenovirus that could potentially evade the neutralizing antibody response against rAd5. The core structure of the hexon protein was not altered, so the resulting HVR-chimaeric rAd5 vectors retained their ability to grow well in culture and, importantly, the immunogenicity of the chimaeras was comparable to that of rAd5. As Roberts  et al . hoped, when the HVR chimaeras were administered to mice or monkeys that had antibody immunity to rAd5, there was no decrease in the immunogenicity of the vector. These data provide a proof-of-concept that viral vaccine vectors can be engineered to evade pre-existing immunity. The results are a tribute to the application of modern immunology and structural biology to vaccine design. The potential of this technology is considerable. One can envisage the construction of numerous HVR chimaeras that could be used to vaccinate against various pathogens. Thus, if rAd5 itself were used to vaccinate children against malaria, a chimaeric vector could still be used as an HIV vaccine. Furthermore, the use of multiple chimaeric serotypes could allow booster vaccinations to sustain the long-term immune memory response needed for durable immunity. Yet we are still some time away from studies in humans. Vaccine developers will have to show that these new HVR-chimaeric rAd5 vectors can be manufactured, and that they have stable gene inserts, can pass regulatory review and, finally, are immunogenic in humans with pre-existing immunity. Current rAd5 vectors for HIV-1 are being evaluated in phase II human trials that will more precisely define the extent and effect of pre-existing anti-vector immunity. As we await these data, chimaeric vectors can be manufactured and tested in humans, so that we can further assess the potential effects of anti-vector immunity. Reprints and Permissions"},

Over a period of ten weeks, the authors immunized five camelids \u2014 three llamas and two camels \u2014 with caffeine linked to an immune stimulant called keyhole limpet haemocyanin. They subsequently identified and isolated antibody fragments that bind only to caffeine in blood samples from the immunized animals, and produced one of these as a soluble protein. The chosen antibody preparation retained almost all of its activity after incubation at temperatures up to 90 \u00b0C, whereas that of comparable preparations derived from mice dropped away sharply above 70 \u00b0C. Swilled through regular and decaffeinated coffee and caffeinated soft drinks, in each case it registered caffeine levels in good agreement with established values.

Haswell"}], "parsed_as_year": "2006_or_before", "body": "A method that combines techniques for performing chemical synthesis, separation and measurement on a single device illustrates the considerable potential of integrated lab-on-a-chip technology. The traditional icons of chemistry, the test-tube and conical flask, are in many situations giving way to lab-on-a-chip methodology. This route to miniaturization offers high-throughput control of reactions that range in context from chemical synthesis and measurement, through biological processing, to medical diagnostics. The prospect of realizing the full potential of lab-on-a-chip methodology comes a little closer with work reported by Detlev Belder and colleagues in  Angewandte Chemie 1 . The authors' strategy exploits the various benefits of performing reactions within a microfluidic environment, and interfaces this process to an efficient separation and detection system. They test their procedures by analysing the efficiency with which different mutant enzymes, created by directed evolution, select for different chiral or enantio-meric reaction products. The potential advantages of lab-on-a-chip miniaturization include low operating volumes, faster reaction or sample-processing times, safer procedures, and the more efficient selective generation of products 2 . For processes carried out in solution, many of these advantages arise from the control of samples and reagents that can be achieved within a network of micro-metre-sized fluidic channels. The temperature and concentration gradients created in such systems can be used to control reaction conditions; and the high ratios between surface area and volume can be especially effective in exploiting processes that occur at interfaces. Microfluidic reactors do, however, have their drawbacks. For example, the price of trading the slow thermal and mass-transfer processes of a conventional reactor for the speed of a microreactor is much smaller amounts of product. But high flow rates or scaled-up procedures 3  can compensate. For instance, microreactors with channel cross-sections of only 250 \u00b5m have been used to carry out a common class of reaction, known as Mizoroki\u2013Heck-type reactions, at a flow rate of 500 \u00b5l per minute to produce 12 g of pure product per hour 4 . So, in principle, 1,000 such reactors should be able to produce 288 kg of product per day. Another potential drawback is blockage of the channel network by particulate matter. But this problem can be minimized by careful selection of channel geometries and other parameters. Belder and colleagues' chip for integrated catalysis and product analysis is shown in  Figure 1 . In their paper 1  they describe the reaction of 10 \u00b5l of glycidyl phenyl ether with a similar volume of various mutant epoxide hydrolases derived from the fungus  Aspergillus niger . Enzyme and substrate were allowed to mix and react for 10 minutes, before an electro-phoretic separation step (which took less than 90 seconds); fluorescence detection was used to monitor the proportions of different enantiomeric forms of product. To further illustrate the value of integrating the reaction and separation\u2013detection processes, the authors also used the chip to establish the reaction kinetics; this involved sequential injections of substrate and enzyme variants, followed by repeated analysis of the enantio-meric products as a function of time. So far so good. But Belder and co-workers' chip 1  is also equipped with additional ports for introducing reactants, allowing up to three catalysts to be screened against one substrate in a single set of experiments. In principle, the current fabrication technology should allow this to be scaled up to tens or even hundreds of parallel streams. In terms of throughput, the authors also suggest that the 10-minute mixing and reaction time could be reduced through the introduction of a more efficient micromixer design. Finally, greater integration could be achieved by packaging the fluorescence-detection system, which at present requires an external laser source and detector to be aligned with the chip, into a single, more robust unit. The contents of journals such as  Lab on a Chip  and  Microfluidics and Nanofluidics  attest to what has already been achieved with miniaturized chemistry. Building microreactors with full integration of chemical, biological, analytical and communication systems \u2014 for, say, remote operation \u2014 will require compromises, but it is an advantage that the fabrication of such systems has a common basis 5 . Uses of the technology will include drug discovery, where drug candidates could be synthesized and screened for toxicity and activity in minutes, with an iterative procedure allowing swifter and surer identification of the best molecules 6 . There will be other applications in personalized medicine, drug delivery, environmental and security monitoring, and forensics and space exploration. Finally, integrated miniaturized systems should eventually be relatively cheap. They will be much more affordable than full lab facilities \u2014 not least in developing countries.

But further work is needed to ensure that this promise is fulfilled. Earth's ozone layer completely blocks solar light of very low ultraviolet wavelengths. Biological organisms on Earth have therefore never developed a tolerance for this \u2018UVC\u2019 radiation, and artificially generated UVC light has become a useful tool in the treatment and destruction of bacteria, yeast, viruses and fungi. Mercury, xenon and deuterium lamps are currently the main sources of UVC light, but the high operating voltages and large size of such lamps, together with the environmental dangers of using mercury, preclude their use in techniques for disinfection, for air and water purification and in biomedicine. On  page 325  of this issue, Taniyasu  et al . 1  report the potentially revolutionary production of UVC light using semiconductor light-emitting diodes (LEDs) based on aluminium nitride, which could be powered by low-voltage solar cells. An LED generally comprises a junction between semiconductor materials with two different types of conductivity, electron conductivity and hole conductivity, that are equivalent to the movement of negative and positive charge carriers, respectively. At the junction, electrons and holes recombine, emitting energy in the form of light. Highly efficient blue\u2013green LEDs, using semiconducting aluminium indium gallium nitride (AlInGaN), were initially reported 2  in the early 1990s. Thus, for the first time, miniature low-voltage light sources in all three primary colours \u2014 red, green and blue \u2014 became available, opening up a multi-billion-dollar market for the lighting and display industries. LEDs that emit at even lower, ultraviolet wavelengths, divided into UVA, UVB and UVC, soon followed 3 , 4  ( Fig. 1 ). The main obstacle to the development of both blue\u2013green and ultraviolet LEDs has been the difficulty in manipulating the conduction properties of various AlInGaN materials that possess the appropriate optical properties. The level and type of conductivity of such materials can be controlled by incorporating impurities into them such as silicon and magnesium, in a process known as doping. Indium nitride (with no aluminium or gallium) absorbs visible and ultraviolet light, and is typically a good conductor. Manipulating its conductivity by doping is also relatively easy. The same is true for gallium nitride, but this compound only absorbs ultraviolet radiation, and is completely transparent to visible light. Typically, the wavelength of light emitted from a semiconductor LED is nearly the same as that of the light that it absorbs. And as the proportion of aluminium in the alloy increases, so does its transparency down to lower ultra-violet wavelengths. Thus, whereas an LED based on indium gallium nitride emits visible radiation, those based on aluminium gallium nitride and aluminium nitride generate ultraviolet light with a wavelength in the UVB and the UVC portion of the solar spectrum, respectively. But unfortunately, as the aluminium fraction increases, so too does the difficulty of doping. It is hardest of all for aluminium nitride \u2014 which is, in fact, an insulator. There are several reasons why it is difficult to turn aluminium nitride or aluminium gallium nitride with large aluminium fractions into conductors. It requires the incorporation of many impurity atoms to generate additional positive and negative current carriers, but thermal vibrational effects caused by the high-temperature conditions required for growing high-quality crystalline aluminium nitride layers work against this incorporation process. In addition, the layers are deposited over non-nitride materials, such as sapphire, generating a large number of defects that hinder doping. Defects are also generated if the number of incorporated dopant species becomes too numerous, resulting in a self-compensation effect that actually reduces conductivity. Finally, the effect of doping material on the conduction properties can be compensated by that of other materials such as hydrogen gas, used as part of the manufacturing process. Taniyasu and colleagues' crucial contribution 1  is to overcome these obstacles by using a variation of the standard growth conditions. They control the amount of dopant precisely to avoid self-compensation, and use annealing procedures to avoid compensation effects from the reactant gases such as hydrogen. They are thus able to impart to aluminium nitride sufficient conductivity for both positive and negative current carriers. By combining layers of the two conducting types, they fabricated LEDs emitting at a UVC wavelength of 210 nanometres \u2014 at present the shortest reported wavelength of any LED when injected with electrical current. Developments are needed in two areas to improve such UVC LEDs to the point where they can be used in devices: first, an increase in their efficiency by a factor of at least a million; and second, a reduction in their operating voltage to well below the 25 volts used by Taniyasu and colleagues 1 . The first development will require substantial improvements in the crystalline quality of the aluminium nitride layers; the second will necessitate more-efficient doping to bring about a near thousandfold increase in their room-temperature conductivity. Both challenges are difficult: further bold and innovative research will be required if the promise of UVC LEDs is to be fulfilled. Reprints and Permissions"},

A. Prasanna de Silva and colleagues present an appropriate strategy, which bears the grand title of molecular computational identification, or MCID ( Nature Mater.  doi:10.1038/nmat1733; 2006 ). In essence, the technique involves using a series of single-input 'logic gates' \u2014 in this case, fluorescent dyes \u2014 that respond differently to various chemical stimuli, and whose combined response is unique to a particular molecule. That might be useful to those in the pharmaceutical industry, for example, who need to be able to keep close tabs on libraries of different, but structurally related, compounds. The authors set about finding fluorescent molecules that reproduce the effects of five different logic gates when exposed to the H +  ion, which is responsible for acidity in water. Two of these gates, PASS 1 and PASS 0, produce a positive or a negative response regardless of the input and are trivial: they are, respectively, a fluorescent dye immobilized on a polymer bead, and no tag molecule at all. For the YES gate, a molecule was chosen in which a process known as photoinduced electron transfer hinders fluorescence. When H +  ions are present, they interact with electrons that would otherwise be transferred, so the molecule fluoresces. By using tag molecules with subtly different structures, the H +  concentration at which this effect kicks in can be altered, and different colours of fluorescence can be created. Similar principles apply to the authors' NOT gate, which is activated when the concentration of H +  is low. Pictured is an array of tag beads that has been immersed in hydrochloric acid (where the H +  concentration is high; top image) or the alkali sodium hydroxide (with a lower level of H +  ions; bottom image). The disappearance of twoYES beads (bottom left) and the appearance of two NOT beads (middle) is clearly visible. The technique can be easily extended to multiple-input gates, as the authors demonstrate with a tag molecule that acts as an AND gate. It fluoresces only in the presence of both H +  and the sodium ion Na + . Other distinguishable input stimuli are calcium, caesium and zinc ions, glucose molecules, and even heat and light. The various available inputs, gates, switching thresholds and output colours could make MCID a sophisticated cataloguing tool, say the authors. Molecules and other nanoscale objects, like so much in today's world, may soon become familiar with computerized ID. Reprints and Permissions"},

In the life cycle of these animals, which is spent entirely underground, a single \u2018queen\u2019 female mates with one or two unrelated males. The rest of the colony members generally invest their efforts in caring for successive litters of young, hunting for food and maintaining the colony's intricate network of tunnels. These worker mole-rats are divided into two types: \u2018frequent\u2019 and \u2018infrequent\u2019 workers, the latter being evidently lazy types that may comprise as much as 40% of the community but do less than 5% of the work. Elsewhere in this issue, M. Scantlebury  et al . describe how they have followed up circumstantial evidence for the reasons behind this division of labour, and show that in certain situations the layabouts spring into action ( pages 795 ). Mole-rat workers are thought to postpone their own reproduction (sometimes indefinitely) because of the difficulties of setting up a new colony in the rock-hard soil. Extensive burrowing, and so the chance of meeting a mate from another colony, is restricted to brief periods, maybe once or twice a year, when heavy rains soften the soil. Is this when infrequent workers pay their dues? To find out, Scantlebury and colleagues examined individuals they trapped at burrow entrances. By measuring the body fat, daily energy expenditure and resting metabolic rate of several individuals during a dry period and after rainfall, the authors show that the infrequent workers are fatter and expend far less energy than the other workers when it is dry. Following rainfall, however, they display bursts of effort not shown by the other colony members. Scantlebury  et al . propose that, by conserving their energy during dry periods and then digging furiously after it has rained, the fat workers have a good chance of dispersing far enough to find a mate. As the authors point out, funnelling extra resources into a dispersive caste may well be a sensible strategy for the colony as a whole. These apparent layabouts may spend most of their time reaping the benefits of colony life, such as food and protection, without pulling their weight. But they seem to give good returns when it comes to exploiting environmental conditions to ensure long-term survival of the colony's gene pool. Reprints and Permissions"},

The claim that, under certain conditions, the opposite is possible disturbs that cherished belief. Have you noticed how slick the exteriors of cars have become lately? Side mirrors are aerodynamically shaped; windows are an integral part of the doors; no parts hang out over the side of the body. Even windscreen wipers can be retracted when not in use. A smooth body is not only better looking; it can reduce aerodynamic drag, and thus makes a car faster and more fuel-efficient \u2014 or so we are led to believe. In fact, this prevailing wisdom may not be true: Fransson  et al . 1  report in  Physical Review Letters  that surface bumps are actually useful for reducing drag. So what's going on? To get to the bottom of this matter, we must look at the evolution of fluid flows over a solid surface. Initially, these flows are silky smooth and move together; they are \u2018laminar\u2019. Soon, however, the inherent instability of a laminar flow leads to its becoming random and chaotic, or \u2018turbulent\u2019. Turbulent flow is usually associated with characteristics such as strong mixing of the fluid and high energy loss through dissipation. The drag that cars experience is therefore greater when the surrounding flow is turbulent: if a laminar flow can be maintained, the frictional drag acting on the car is much less. Fransson and colleagues 1  conducted experiments under controlled conditions in a wind tunnel, and were able to maintain laminar flow along a wall for longer by deliberately making its surface rough. We naively expect that surface roughness will create disturbances that lead to turbulent flow, so the result is, on the face of it, puzzling. But the authors were able to show that, by carefully controlling the disturbances created by the surface roughness, they could make the flow over a body surface more resistant to a certain type of instability, and so postpone the onset of turbulence until farther downstream ( Fig. 1 ). The authors used a flat wall, to which uniformly distributed \u2018roughness\u2019 elements were attached that produced steady, corkscrew-like disturbances in the flow, called streaks. Their experimental results confirm simulations showing 2  that a moderate strength of streaks can indeed stabilize the laminar flow. Although the size and shape of roughness elements are important in this experiment, the strength of the disturbance they create in the flow is also crucial. If this is too strong, a more deadly instability kicks in and the flow quickly becomes turbulent 3 . Using surface roughness to reduce friction drag is, in the case of turbulent flow, not new. Randomized, V-shaped roughness elements are known to reduce friction drag 4  in such flows, as are sand grains attached to a surface 5 . Cross-flow variation \u2014 a disturbance in velocity that occurs at right angles to the main flow \u2014 is also known to be caused by regular roughness elements. Its effect on turbulent flow has been studied theoretically 6  by solving the equations governing fluid flows directly by computer. In these cases, the key to drag reduction is efficient modification of organized structures of various shapes that have been identified as supplying most of the energy in turbulent flows. It has been argued that randomized roughness elements destroy such structures 4 , whereas cross-flow variation stabilizes a flow 6 , thus preventing the structures' reproduction. A regular pattern of roughness elements that introduces such a cross-flow variation to a laminar flow is central to Fransson and colleagues' study 1 . Their success in reducing drag reinforces the idea that organized structures in turbulent flows are the remnants of laminar flow structures after they have undergone the transition to turbulence. Several investigations have sought to repeat physical and numerical experiments by artificially introducing disturbances into the flow, but only a few 7  have succeeded. This implies that such results might be sensitive to small variations in geometric and flow parameters. So how robust is the flow-control strategy proposed by Fransson and colleagues? It is fair to say that, as the shape of the roughness elements is critically important in stabilizing laminar flow, totally different flow patterns might emerge even when their shape is changed only slightly. Applying the technique to high-speed flows might also present a problem, as the streaks will become unsteady at higher speed. Roughness elements will introduce additional drag as they disturb the flow, so any reduction in friction drag by roughness elements must compensate for this if a strategy is to have practical value. The prize for overcoming such problems, and recognizing that smooth is not everything, is great. Its value lies in the ability to design and build fuel-efficient airplanes, quieter submarines and faster cars \u2014 both more easily and more cheaply. Reprints and Permissions"},

Similar behaviours, interpreted as feigning death, may also be open to alternative explanations. When gripped by a predator, many animals stop struggling and apparently feign death. This behaviour has been described in mammals, birds, fish, reptiles, crustaceans and especially insects. But its evolutionary benefit \u2014 or adaptive significance \u2014 has generally not been considered, except to speculate that predators somehow \u2018lose interest\u2019 in prey that they mistakenly think are dead. As reported in  Proceedings of the Royal Society , Atsushi Honma and colleagues 1  provide a demonstration of an anti-predator benefit to such behaviour. In laboratory experiments, they found that grasshoppers ( Criotettix japonicus ) adopted a characteristic static pose when grabbed by frogs, such that three body parts were stretched in different directions, making the grasshoppers more difficult to swallow. Frogs often abandoned prey that struck this attitude. In further experiments, the grasshoppers did not adopt this pose when captured by other predators that do not swallow them whole. This is both a demonstration of an advantage to predator-induced immobility and a warning that we are probably mistakenly interpreting other behaviours as feigning death. The adoption of an immobile pose when an animal is physically restrained is also called tonic immobility, thanatosis and (more colloquially) playing possum. This response is quite different from freezing to make detection by predators more difficult, because it generally happens only after the predator has grasped the prey. In poultry, the duration of tonic immobility induced by human manual restraint is used as a measure of stress 2 . And next time you see a beetle scuttling across the ground, you can attempt to induce tonic immobility yourself by tapping the beetle lightly on the back. The usual explanation is that this behaviour fools the predator into thinking that the prey is dead, causing the predator to lose interest. But there is no convincing explanation for this apparently maladaptive loss of interest. Feigning death might be adaptive if the predator is attempting to subdue several prey in rapid succession before returning to consume them, with prey immobility causing the predator to prematurely release one victim and move on to subduing the next 3 . Even if this explanation is true, however, it cannot explain the impressive diversity of this behaviour throughout the animal kingdom. Another potential mechanism is that tonic immobility serves as a signal that an animal possesses defensive chemicals. Miyatake  et al . 4  have shown that tonic immobility is a heritable trait in  Tribolium  flour beetles, and that it is used to good effect when a beetle is attacked by spiders. They report that, when preying on flies, a spider never set a fly free after grabbing it, and always ate it immediately. In contrast, a spider always relinquished its hold on a flour beetle during the first attack. Miyatake  et al . found that if the beetle struggled, it was attacked again and often consumed. But they say that, \u201cIf, however, the prey feigned death and remained immobile after the first attack, the spider often lost interest and the prey survived\u201d. I suggest that, rather than feigning death, the beetles may be signalling that because they have a strong chemical defence, which the spider may have already sampled in the first attack, they have no need to struggle or flee. This is similar to the characteristically slow flying adopted by butterflies with chemical defence, signalling that they have no need to fear capture 5 . This hypothesis could be tested: I would predict that beetle lines bred for tonic immobility might also be expected to have greater chemical defence than control lines. So much for speculation. By contrast, Honma  et al . 1  have produced what is to my knowledge the first logically and empirically supported theory to account for tonic immobility: making physical handling of prey more challenging. It is unlikely that this mechanism can explain more than a subset of cases of tonic immobility. But their paper will do the valuable service of shaking us from the rut of interpreting such behaviours uncritically as feigning death. Reprints and Permissions"},

David R. Walt and colleagues have devised a system to do just that ( J. Am. Chem. Soc.  doi:10.1021/ja057057b; 2006). The authors attached a fluorescent indicator to polymeric, micrometre-sized beads. The indicator, fluoresceinamine, reacts with nerve agents such as sarin and soman that contain chemical groups known as phosphoryl halides. This causes the beads to fluoresce within seconds of a vapour burst (see lower image; red indicates fluorescence). As the reaction also generates acid, which reduces the intensity of the fluorescence, the authors coated the beads with another polymer that included units of the organic compound pyridine. This basic layer neutralized the acid, maximizing the beads' shine. The fluoresceinamine reaction is specific to a certain class of chemical, so the microbeads don't respond to other, chemically distinct warfare agents such as mustard gas. Crucially, everyday vapours such as ethanol, toluene and water also fail to stimulate fluorescence, allowing the unambiguous detection of sarin-like chemicals. The beads can be easily integrated into current \u2018electronic nose\u2019 technology used to detect and respond to many different vapours. Incorporated into the sensor array of such a nose, the sarin-detecting beads could react to small amounts of toxin in high concentrations of background vapours.

William Perkin was an 18-year-old student of August Wilhelm Hofmann at the Royal College of Chemistry in London, working on the chemical synthesis of natural products. In a classic case of serendipity, Perkin chanced on his famous \u2018aniline mauve\u2019 dye while attempting to synthesize something else entirely: quinine, then the only known remedy for malaria. As a student of the renowned German chemist Justus von Liebig, Hofmann had made a name for himself by showing that a basic compound called aniline, obtained from coal tar, had the same properties as a compound distilled from raw, plant-derived indigo. Coal tar was the residue of coal-gas production, and there was intense interest in finding uses for the aromatic compounds, such as aniline, that could be extracted from it. Working at home, Perkin tried to use an aniline derivative to make quinine by oxidation, based on the similarity of their chemical formulae (their molecular structures are very different). The reaction produced only a reddish sludge. But when the inquisitive Perkin tried the reaction using aniline instead, he got a black precipitate that dissolved in methylated spirits to give a purple solution. Textiles and dyeing being big business at the time, Perkin was astute enough to test the coloured compound on silk, which it dyed richly. Hitherto, almost all dyes were natural compounds extracted from plants and animals. Boldly, Perkin persuaded his father and brother to set up a small factory with him to manufacture the dye, which he called mauve; the picture here is of a shawl, dyed with mauve, from 1862. The Perkins and others (including Hofmann) soon discovered a whole rainbow of aniline dyes, and by the mid-1860s aniline-dye companies included the nascent giants of today's chemicals industry, such as Bayer, Hoechst and BASF.

The details of how these duplicated chromosomes are separated are still being puzzled out, but elsewhere in this issue, Georjana Barnes and colleagues ( Nature   440 , 565\u2013569; 2006) add a large piece to the jigsaw. During cell division, an array of tiny filaments called microtubules spreads from the poles of the cell to the central plane, where the duplicated chromosomes congregate. This microtubule structure \u2014 the \u2018mitotic spindle\u2019 \u2014 is responsible for dragging the two copies of the chromosome apart into the two regions that will form the daughter cells. Microtubules are linear polymers of the protein tubulin of diameter 24 nm that grow or shrink as tubulin monomers are added to or lost from their ends. During chromosome segregation, the microtubules depolymerize, and thus shorten, from the end nearest the central plane of the cell. So, as the spindle shrinks, the attached chromosomes are carried towards the pole. The chromosomes stick to the depolymerizing ends of the spindle microtubules through specialized protein complexes known as kinetochores. But if these ends are continually dissolving as the microtubules pull back, how do the chromosomes stay attached? The answer lies with a subcomplex in the kinetochore, called the Dam1 complex, which assembles into rings and paired helices that encircle the ends of depolymerizing microtubules (pictured). Barnes  et al . used real-time imaging to watch the Dam1 complex on dynamic microtubules  in vitro . They labelled the Dam1 complex and the microtubules with different coloured fluorophores. As the microtubules shortened during depolymerization, the Dam1 complex could clearly be seen progressing along the microtubules. This movement could be explained either by a \u2018sliding\u2019 mechanism, in which the Dam1 complex is continually associated with the microtubule lattice, or by a \u2018turnover\u2019 mechanism, with new subunits of the Dam1 complex rapidly incorporating into existing rings as old subunits leave, thus propelling the ring along the microtubule. The authors demonstrated that turnover of Dam1-complex subunits was not taking place and that the ring structure is sliding intact along the depolymerizing microtubule. Finally, Barnes and colleagues showed that the Dam1 complex can function as a coupling device to move objects along the microtubules. These experiments relied on the strong bonds formed between streptavidin and biotin molecules. Streptavidin-coated microbeads were recruited to the microtubules using a biotin-labelled Dam1 complex. As the microtubules depolymerized, the Dam1 complex slid along the spindle away from the shrinking ends, bearing its cargo of beads. It will be interesting to find out whether chromosomes are transported in the same way. Reprints and Permissions"},

The plumes seen in this picture consist not only of steam produced by the evaporation of water, but also of aerosols and gases that stem from the reaction between the lava and salt water. M. Edmonds and T. M. Gerlach have investigated the composition of such plumes produced by lava from Kilauea Volcano, Hawaii ( Earth Planet. Sci. Lett.  doi: 10.1016/j.epsl.2006.02.005). Their main tool was open-path Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, which allowed remote sensing of the plumes and estimation of the amounts of various components \u2014 water, carbon dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, sulphur dioxide and hydrogen chloride. The most notable of Edmonds and Gerlach's conclusions stem from their analyses of this last species, HCl. First, from thermodynamic considerations they calculate that the HCl gas is created following the hydrolysis of magnesium chloride salts (and not of sodium chloride, as an alternative explanation has it). Second, given that conclusion, they estimate how much HCl is produced by the lava\u2013seawater interaction. The outcome depends on various assumptions and factors, including the type, extent and duration of the lava flow. Edmonds and Gerlach estimate that a lava flow of 1 m 3  s \u22121  could in principle produce 3.7 kg s \u22121  of HCl, or 300 tonnes daily. For various reasons that they discuss, this number is likely to be much lower (3\u201330 tonnes). Figures of this latter order of magnitude produce only localized high concentrations of HCl gas and acid rain. But the authors point out that in the past the story must have had a more serious edge. Eruptions of Hawaiian volcanoes in 1840, 1919 and 1950 produced massive lava flows, with sustained lava fluxes entering the sea. The result was an estimated HCl output of 200\u20132,200 tonnes per day over several weeks, a much more serious environmental hazard. Reprints and Permissions"},

Franz Pfeiffer and colleagues ( Nature Phys.  doi:10.1038/nphys265; 2006) now realign the popular view. They use X-rays to generate high-contrast images not only of bone, but also of the soft tissues that surround them. The approach could readily be used to improve the diagnostic power of existing medical-imaging equipment. Conventional medical X-ray imaging uses the fact that the harder and denser the body tissues are, the more radiation they absorb, and the more contrast they produce on X-ray films. This makes it easy to distinguish bones and other dense bodies, such as tumours, from surrounding tissues. But discerning details of softer tissues from only the contrast in absorption is difficult. When an X-ray passes through tissue, however, it is not just absorbed: its phase is changed too. And this phase shift is more sensitive to variations in the composition of soft-tissue structures than is absorption. But until now, extracting information about phase has required interferometric reconstruction techniques and bathing the target object in the ultra-high-intensity radiation of a synchrotron particle accelerator. Pfeiffer  et al . use a sequence of phase-contrast gratings to manipulate the relative phases of the X-rays that illuminate and subsequently emerge from an object. They can thus generate phase-contrast images \u2014 for example this 50-mm\u00d750-mm picture of an angelfish \u2014 using commercial X-ray sources at much lower intensity, and cost, than has previously been possible.

It provides a close-up view of how and when stars formed, and how they affect the primordial gas around them. A trio of contributions to this issue 1 , 2 , 3  presents observations of the most distant stellar explosion ever seen: a \u03b3-ray burst (GRB) that took place when the Universe (currently accepted age, roughly 13.7 billion years) was only about 900 million years old. Thus, for the first time, the most distant objects that can be identified spectroscopically are not just galaxies \u2014 and therefore huge agglomerates of stars, gas and dust \u2014 but also individual stars. The hunt for cosmic structures that ignited when the Universe was in its infancy takes us to the frontier of our current observational capabilities ( Fig. 1 ). Not too long ago, the most distant objects known were quasi-stellar objects, or quasars 4  \u2014 glaringly luminous objects powered by gas falling into massive black holes at the centres of galaxies. Over the past few years, however, extremely sensitive surveys with space- and ground-based telescopes have allowed us to observe ordinary galaxies beyond the farthest quasars 5 . Since then, the race has been on to find the most distant star. As most stars lead relatively unexciting lives, they remain far less luminous than galaxies, and so distant stars are generally too faint to be detected with current technology. Some heavyweight stars, however, end their lives violently and spectacularly. These stars send out bursts of radiation so luminous that they appear bright even when viewed across vast stretches of the Universe. On 4 September 2005, such a flash of \u03b3-rays, lasting for 80 seconds, hit NASA's purpose-built GRB-detection satellite, Swift. Swift's \u03b3-ray monitor established the position of the burst \u2014 prosaically labelled GRB 050904 \u2014 in the constellation Pisces. As Cusumano  et al . describe ( page 164 ) 1 , within seconds Swift turned around to direct its X-ray telescope at the region where the burst occurred, pinpointing the location of a rapidly fading source of radiation to within a hundredth of a degree. This in turn allowed powerful optical and infrared telescopes around the world to search for the decaying \u2018afterglow\u2019 signal within their wavelength ranges. On  page 184 , Kawai  et al . 2  report measurements of the afterglow of GRB 050904 at optical wavelengths. And, on  page 181 , Haislip  et al . 3  detail the tightly choreographed sequence of observations necessary to detect the barely visible afterglow at even longer, near-infrared wavelengths. In astronomy, distance, time and the wavelength at which observations are made are inextricably linked. Light travels at a finite speed, and so takes a finite time to get to us. Far-off objects are thus seen as they were in the past. Cosmologists generally use the redshift  z  to designate distance or, equivalently, look-back time. The quantity 1 + z is the factor by which the Universe has expanded between the time when a source emitted the light we observe and the present, and is also the factor by which the wavelength of light reaching us has been stretched owing to the expansion of the Universe. So by measuring the wavelengths of absorption lines in the spectrum of the optical afterglow of GRB 050904, and comparing these with wavelengths characteristic of the heavier elements such as carbon, sulphur and silicon that are found in stars, the redshift of GRB 050904 was found 2  to be  z =6.295. It is thus the most distant stellar explosion ever witnessed, and occurred when the Universe was about 7% of its current age. Setting a new record for the farthest stellar explosion might seem noteworthy enough, but distance alone does not make GRB 050904 interesting. Its attraction lies in what it can reveal about star formation early in the history of the Universe. Over the past decade, astronomers have been particularly successful in tracing how early stellar systems changed and coalesced to become the \u2018respectable\u2019 elliptical, spiral and irregular galaxies seen in the present-day Universe. These early galaxies are far less luminous than quasars, but are still (as we see them) forming new stars, and so emitting copious amounts of light. Among these, the galaxy hosting the youngest-known quasar 4  gives the earliest example of a star-forming region 6 . The presence in this galaxy of a large amount of mass in the form of interstellar molecules and dust is proof not only that substantial star formation was taking place only 800 million years after the Big Bang, but also that the process of chemical enrichment \u2014 in which heavier elements synthesized by previous generations of stars are incorporated into the galaxy \u2014 was well advanced. Star formation in these early epochs was therefore probably not too different from that taking place now in some regions of the local Universe. It is in itself no surprise that a GRB can occur at these early times: GRBs are thought to be produced by the deaths of a rare breed of massive stars 7 , and, the more massive a star, the shorter its lifetime. Stars slightly more massive than our Sun have lifetimes that are shorter than the age of the Universe at  z =6.295, and a star 20 times as massive can keep going for only a thousandth as long. So far, however, GRB 050904 is the only example of a stellar explosion that occurred at a time in the evolution of the Universe before \u2018reionization\u2019, the point when the hydrogen between galaxies was completely ionized by ultraviolet radiation. Neutral hydrogen in the Universe at  z =6.295 would have been a very effective absorber of any photon from GRB 050904 emitted at a wavelength shorter than the hydrogen \u2018Lyman \u03b1\u2019 line at 121.6 nm. Interestingly, such a damped Lyman \u03b1 absorption profile of neutral hydrogen is not easily discernible in the optical afterglow spectrum 2  of GRB 050904. Instead, one sees flux absorbed by the presence of a dense screen of metal-enriched gas in the immediate surroundings, presumably ejected by the massive stellar progenitor prior to collapse. This might make GRBs less suited as clean markers of when, exactly, the reionization epoch occurred 8 . More optimistically, the detection of metal absorption lines in the afterglow spectrum from the gas around the burst site offers an unusual opportunity to study the physical conditions in the interstellar medium at these early epochs. GRB observations will certainly pave the way for the discovery of more primitive objects than the galaxies presently known at  z =6.5. Distant galaxies are themselves difficult to study because they appear faint and small. GRBs will serve not only as signposts to such galaxies, but could be used to study the gradual build-up of heavy elements in them to determine the conversion history of primordial gas into stars. Although the light from GRB 050904 is likely to have come from a later star that was already metal-enriched, bursts arising from the very first generation of stars 9  (those comprising only light nuclei such as hydrogen and helium produced in the Big Bang) may be detectable. And if bursts can be detected from a time before galaxies had gravitationally assembled, they might even provide a glimpse into the pregalactic phase of the Universe. Reprints and Permissions"},

Analysis of a single-cell parasite, the African trypanosome, reveals that flagella are also essential for viability in this organism. Many cells can move from one position to another, by various means. One locomotive structure that emerged early in evolution is a whip-like appendage called the flagellum that propels the cell by a cyclical beating motion. Stationary cells also use flagella and their shorter relatives, cilia, to move liquid across their surface, as in the lining of air passages for example. In nucleated, or eukaryotic, cells, the flagellum is wrapped in cell membrane and encompasses a central, flexible rod \u2014 the axoneme \u2014 that generates the beating motion. The flagella from diverse organisms have a remarkably similar morphology for the axoneme, with a cylindrical array of nine filaments called microtubules surrounding two core microtubules, which hints that the building-blocks of these structures have been highly conserved during evolution. On  page 224  of this issue, however, Broadhead  et al . 1  reveal a surprising diversity among organisms of the roughly 300 proteins that form the microscopic bricks and mortar of the axoneme. Nonetheless, they also discovered that molecular components of the axoneme in the unicellular African trypanosome parasite are conserved from these ancient protozoa to humans. In humans, abnormal forms of these proteins are linked with debilitating diseases. Perhaps most remarkably, the authors have uncovered a more fundamental role for flagella than cellular motility. Flagella are essential for trypanosome cell division, and thus viability \u2014 an observation that may help in developing therapies against African sleeping sickness, the fatal disease caused by these parasites. Proteomic analysis has become an increasingly powerful tool for defining the structures of subcellular bodies, termed organelles, that perform specialized functions for cells. In this approach, a particular organelle (or sub-structure thereof) is purified and the constituent proteins are identified by sophisticated mass spectrometry. When Broadhead  et al . 1  applied this proteomic analysis to isolated flagellar axonemes from the African trypanosome, they discovered that there were many proteins in the trypanosome organelle that could not be identified from the sequenced genomes of other organisms (with the exception of two other parasitic protozoa closely related to African trypanosomes). A similar analysis by these authors of recently published data on flagellar axonemes from two other unicellular eukaryotes 2 , 3  revealed similarly unique cohorts of axonemal proteins in all three organisms compared. So the apparently conserved morphology of the axoneme belies a hidden molecular diversity. All the same, there are also axonemal proteins that are conserved between trypanosomes and humans. When the authors identified the human chromosomal regions encoding all these conserved axonemal proteins, they found 34 genes that mapped to 25 loci that had been implicated previously in a plethora of genetic diseases. The characteristics of these conditions are consistent with defects in flagella or cilia. These diseases cover a broad spectrum ranging from hydrocephalus and polycystic kidney disease to epilepsy. Although in each case a rough genetic locus had been associated with disease, the specific disease-associated genes had not been identified previously. So Broadhead and colleagues' examination of the ancient trypanosomes has done a significant service to human biology and medicine by identifying likely candidates for disease-causing genes. These results highlight the often-overlooked virtues of studying unusual or \u2018primitive\u2019 organisms. But of course trypanosomes cause a serious disease in their own right. African sleeping sickness is a fatal infection that currently afflicts an estimated 300,000\u2013500,000 people in sub-Saharan Africa 4 . How does the new work 1  help in understanding this devastating disease? This is perhaps the most intriguing part of the story. The authors examined the role of five trypanosome axonemal proteins using RNA interference, a powerful genetic method that allows the selective degradation of an individual messenger RNA, specifically reducing the encoded protein. In all five cases, the trypanosomes underwent a fatal meltdown when they could no longer make each axonemal protein. Although the parasites continued to replicate their DNA, divide their nuclei, and generate new flagella and other organelles, they were unable to divide into independent daughter cells. Instead, they formed spectacularly distorted \u2018monster\u2019 cells ( Fig. 1 ) with multiple nuclei and flagella, and rapidly died. These results were initially astonishing, but they are consistent with observations from the same laboratory that trypanosomes use their flagella to determine cell polarity during division 5 . These previous revelations hinted at what the current paper now confirms, that flagella are indispensable for telling parasites how to divide \u2014 especially in the stage of their life cycle when they are in the bloodstream, causing the human and animal disease. Indeed, the flagellum seems to be the tail that wags the dog. These results raise the intriguing possibility of developing drugs that act selectively against the trypanosome-specific axonemal proteins. It may be possible to identify compounds that cripple the parasite flagellum while leaving the distinct proteins of the human axoneme alone. Reprints and Permissions"},

Erickson"}], "parsed_as_year": "2006_or_before", "body": "Highly complex immunoassays that identify and quantify many different antigens simultaneously need high-resolution imaging capability. A simple, low-cost technique could be music to our ears. The capabilities of immunoassays \u2014 tests that use the binding of \u2018capture\u2019 antibodies to antigens in order to identify the latter \u2014 have been advancing in leaps and bounds over the past three decades. Methods of enzyme amplification have increased assay sensitivity. Diode lasers have reduced the size and cost of instrumentation. Microfluidics has enabled both the analysis of very small sample volumes and the parallel processing of multiple samples. And microarrays of capture antibodies, or other recognition molecules, attached to surfaces have made possible the simultaneous testing of a sample for large numbers of target molecules. This last point harbours a problem. As microarray elements become smaller and smaller for larger and larger numbers of simultaneous tests, the necessary imaging resolution cannot readily be achieved with the standard, off-the-shelf CMOS or CCD technologies. Confocal scanners using microscope lenses can provide the required resolution, but their cost, size and the geometrical alignment of their optics pose other practical problems. Writing in  Angewandte Chemie International Edition , Sebastian A. Lange, G\u00fcnter Roth and colleagues find a way out of this seeming impasse 1 . They demonstrate an immunoassay readout of high efficiency and sensitivity \u2014 using, in a slightly modified form, a pick-up head of a compact-disc player ( Fig. 1 ). The authors' system is both elegant and simple. They used a so-called sandwich immunoassay, in which the antigen to be measured is bound between two different antibodies. First, a capture antibody is stamped in a 25-micrometre square pattern onto a solid substrate; the desired antigen binds to this antibody. Second, a detector antibody binds to this antigen to make it visible to the CD pick-up head. Here, the authors cleverly employed an antibody carrying a gold nanoparticle. This gold nanoparticle catalyses the deposition of silver grains onto the substrate to which the capture antibody, antigen and detector antibody are all now attached. The reflections from the silver grains could be read by the CD pick-up head with a resolution of around 50 nanometres \u2014 considerably smaller than the diameter of most of the silver nano-particles, which is of the order of several hundred nanometres. Using their sandwich system, the authors demonstrated that they could detect antigen in serum at concentrations from 1 microgram per millilitre down to 100 picograms per millilitre. The authors also performed a carefully controlled study in which they spaced antigens, each attached to a capture molecule, well apart from each other on the substrate 1 . They suggest that, by correlating the density of the silver precipitate with the coverage of the antigen, it might be possible to detect single molecules with their system. But measuring a single molecule carefully tied to a uniform surface is a far cry from pulling a single molecule out of a solution, capturing it at a surface and measuring it against a background signal generated from any of several variable sources. The potential for using the CD pick-up head with silver staining for single-molecule detection is therefore less convincing than the suggestion that the technology could be widely useful for low-cost, high-sensitivity readout systems for many different types of assay. Significant issues remain to be addressed. If the CD pick-up head is to be used to detect many different molecules simultaneously, multiple capture molecules will have to be immobilized on surfaces suitable for use with the CD pick-up heads. This is almost sure to require a more flexible technology than the stamping method used by Lange  et al . Optical alignment issues will also need to be addressed. In Lange and colleagues' study, the CD pick-up head is only one part of the optics: it is combined with a microscope stage for coarse adjustment of the magnification, as well as a lateral translation stage to adjust the position of the line of sight over the substrate. Although it may be possible to use built-in hardware in a commercially available CD player to perform these functions, this has yet to be demonstrated. One noteworthy advantage of the CD-pick-up approach, alongside small size, low cost and high resolution, is not emphasized by the authors. Although an assay signal has never actually been generated using a CD as a sensing surface, biochemical manipulations have already been performed directly on a CD. Externally readable fluorescence signals have even been generated in channels within the disc 2 , 3 , 4 , 5  \u2014 the challenge here being the use of centrifugal force to move the fluids through the processing steps on the surface of the CD to the readout position. The combination of such fluidic approaches with  in situ  signal generation as demonstrated by Lange  et al . 1  could potentially lead to a sea change in medical diagnostics. Imagine in the future buying a \u2018respiratory pathogen CD\u2019 from the local pharmacy when you catch a cold, inserting your self-test swab and placing it in your portable player to find out whether you should take antibiotics or stick to the chicken soup.

Richard Henry Dalitz was a giant in the field of particle physics. A theorist who always endeavoured to work close to experiment, his contributions over 60 years shed vital light on the nature of the fundamental forces and the constituents of matter. Born in the small wheat-belt town of Dimboola, northwest of Melbourne, Australia, Dalitz gained degrees in both mathematics and physics at the University of Melbourne. Awarded a travelling scholarship, he moved in 1946 with his wife Valda to England, to study for a PhD under Nicholas Kemmer at Trinity College, Cambridge. There he benefited from the teaching of Paul Dirac, whose lecture course on quantum mechanics he attended twice. After two years, he ran short of funds and, with a small child to support, moved to a one-year post as assistant to Nevill Mott at the University of Bristol. In retrospect, Dalitz considered this year at Bristol vital to his subsequent research: there he first learned from the group of Cecil Powell about elementary particle physics and the \u2018strange\u2019 particles (so named because they left unusual tracks in the emulsions used to detect them) produced in cosmic-ray collisions. He started to think particularly about the nature of one of these, the \u2018tau meson\u2019, or  K + , as it is now known. Dalitz was invited by Rudolf Peierls to the University of Birmingham in 1949, where his encounters with Freeman Dyson proved most useful for his mastery of the quantum-electrodynamical methods that Richard Feynman was then developing to describe electromagnetic interactions. After completing his thesis, which was on transitions between spin states in the oxygen nucleus, Dalitz was finally able to concentrate on particle physics and study of the tau. The result was two seminal contributions that bear his name: the study of the decay of the neutral pion (one of the lightest mesons, a class of particles now identified as quark\u2013antiquark pairings) to a photon and an electron\u2013positron, or \u2018Dalitz\u2019, pair; and the development of the \u2018Dalitz plot\u2019. This plot presents the kinematic variables of the three-body final state of a reaction in two dimensions. This allowed so-called resonances \u2014 transient states that flag their existence through their decay to final-state particles of definite total energy \u2014 to be readily visible. Dalitz was interested in the difference between the tau and another strange particle, the theta, which seemed to be the tau's identical twin except for the fact that it decayed into two pions, whereas the tau decayed into three. Using his plot, he was able to establish that the tau, like the theta, has zero spin, so that the two particles could not be identical if parity holds. (Parity is the idea that reactions proceed the same way when all spatial coordinates are reversed.) Indeed, this \u2018tau\u2013theta\u2019 puzzle was the first indication that parity did not hold for interactions involving the weak nuclear force. The subsequent realization by T. D. Lee and C. N. Yang that this could indeed be the case won them the 1957 Nobel Prize in Physics. After brief periods at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, and back at Birmingham, in 1956 Dalitz accepted a professorship at the Enrico Fermi Institute in Chicago. Working with Riccardo Levi-Setti, he developed what became a lifetime interest, often pursued in collaboration with Avraham Gal, in the recently discovered hypernuclei, in which a strange particle takes the place of a proton or neutron. In 1963, Dalitz was persuaded by Peierls to return to Britain and join him at the University of Oxford as a Royal Society research professor and, from 1964, a fellow of All Souls College. At Oxford, Dalitz continued his work on the resonant states that were being discovered in ever-larger numbers \u2014 often through the use of Dalitz plots. These states could be grouped according to their mass, spin and parity into families of eight and ten. Murray Gell-Mann dubbed this the \u2018eightfold way\u2019, and proposed that the pattern could be explained if the resonances were combinations of fundamental building-blocks of fractional electric charge \u2014 quarks, as he named them. At the time, most physicists considered quarks as merely a mathematical tool. Boldly, Dalitz pursued the possibility that they might be real dynamical objects, and, in a remarkable paper presented in Tokyo in 1965, showed how different combinations of three tightly bound \u2018up\u2019 and \u2018down\u2019 quarks explained many properties of the proton and neutron. He further proposed that the quark model could describe not only these ground states, but also the multitude of higher-energy resonant states. At Oxford, Dalitz established a flourishing research programme to study the quark model, and attracted many senior physicists and students to it. Their work, and work worldwide, has shown that all particles found then and since fit well with quark-model predictions. This encompasses the original strange particles, whose unusual properties are now attributed to the presence of at least one \u2018strange\u2019 quark in their make-up that hampers their decay, as well as states that contain the heavier quarks \u2018charm\u2019 and \u2018bottom\u2019. The quark model was the foundation of quantum chromodynamics (QCD), the comprehensive theory of the strong nuclear force that depicts quarks as being held together by the exchange of gluons \u2014 analogues of the photons of the electromagnetic force \u2014 which are coupled to a new \u2018colour\u2019 charge. Dalitz first heard of colour in a talk by Gell-Mann and recognized that it resolved some profound problems associated with the quark model. The success of this model once colour was included set the scene for the subsequent development of QCD. Dalitz's interest in the quark model continued all his working life. In 1992, with Gary Goldstein, he developed a method still in use today, to determine the detailed properties of the \u2018top\u2019 quark, the last of the six types of quark to be found. A fellow of the Royal Society and recipient of many honours, among them the Hughes Medal and Royal Medal of the Royal Society, \u2018Dick\u2019 Dalitz never lost his appetite for physics. He remained an active member of the theoretical-physics department at Oxford after his retirement in 1990, always keen to encourage students to share in his passion for physics. He died on 13 January 2006, and is survived by his wife, son and three daughters. Reprints and Permissions"},

Borodinsky"}], "parsed_as_year": "2006_or_before", "body": "Rhythmic activities such as walking need tight coordination. In mice, pace is tweaked by a specific set of spinal-cord neurons that, surprisingly, make the animals walk faster by inhibiting the underlying circuit. Watch your step \u2014 walking may seem simple, but is actually quite a complex task. As with other rhythmic motor behaviours (breathing or swallowing, say), locomotion relies on a finely tuned neuronal network that is headquartered in the spinal cord 1 , 2 . The ensemble of spinal neurons that generates a coordinated rhythmic activity is known as a central pattern generator. The rhythm and periodicity of this network determines movement features such as the alternation between left and right, or the speed of walking, jumping or swimming 3 . Understanding how this circuit operates and the specific roles of the different neurons that participate in it is difficult, but Gosgnach and colleagues 4  have taken up the challenge. On  page 215  of this issue, they report that the activity of a group of spinal-cord neurons controls the speed of locomotor behaviour in the mouse. Neuronal circuits are formed by a network of interconnected excitatory and inhibitory neurons. In a very simplistic model, the former group switches the circuit on and the latter turns it off. Gosgnach  et al . studied the role of a subclass of inhibitory spinal neurons known as V1 neurons, which are thought to be part of the central pattern generator. The researchers used detailed information about the gene-regulatory factors that underlie the development and specialization of these neurons, to generate mutant mice in which V1 neurons were either eliminated or silenced acutely during the experiment, and examined the changes in locomotor activity. Counterintuitively, they found that removing the inhibition caused by V1 neurons slows the speed of the locomotor rhythm. Mutant mice lacking V1 neurons are unable to walk fast, but they can maintain normal motor behaviour at a slower pace. The authors demonstrate that this is because motor neurons connecting the spinal cord to the muscle are not sufficiently inhibited, because connections from the V1 neurons are missing in the mutant animals. The activity of motor neurons needs to be interleaved with precise periods of silence to generate a faster pace. These results underscore the value of inhibition in the nervous system: the delicate balance and fine-tuning of neuronal activity set by inhibitory connections is not only important in quieting down the system, but can also change core features of nervous-system function. Even though Gosgnach and colleagues' mice slow down, other parameters of their locomotor activity remain intact, such as the alternation of left and right limbs necessary for coordinated stepping. As the authors showed previously 5 , a different class of spinal neurons (V0) is responsible for left\u2013right coordination. In mutant mice lacking V0 neurons, the left and right motor neurons fire at the same time, rather than alternating. These are significant insights into how the work is distributed among the vast collection of spinal neurons that make up the central pattern generator. How are the circuits of the central pattern generator established? When exploring the formation of circuits, scientists have focused on two principal alternative theories. One of these proposes that a genetically driven programme predetermines the identity of the neurons that participate in a given circuit and dictates how and between which of them connections are made 6 . The second proposes that early in development, neurons exhibit spontaneous electrical activity that affects the process of neuronal specialization and the establishment of appropriate connections 7 , 8 . Changes in activity during development can indeed lead to resetting of the intrinsic excitability of neurons as well as reconfiguration of connections 9 . In particular, formation of motor central pattern generators requires early spontaneous electrical activity, because when this activity is disrupted, motor neuron fibres fail to follow their normal trajectories 10 . However, Gosgnach  et al . 4  find that the activity of V1 neurons does not seem to be involved in the formation of the central pattern generator. Their results show that loss of V1 neurons early in development is not compensated for by any reconfiguration of the circuit \u2014 the mutant mice that chronically lost V1 neurons at early stages exhibit the same slow locomotor rhythm as that observed when neurons are acutely silenced after the circuit is formed. Nevertheless, studies of rewiring during development are complex; they require a rather dynamic approach because exclusive examination of the final end point may not reveal intermediate remodelling processes that are crucial to the resulting network. In this regard, it would be interesting to test what happens to the circuit and locomotor activity if neurons are silenced at different times during development. Formation of circuits is likely to depend on both genetically driven and activity-shaped processes. We need to keep our minds open if we are to understand the interplay of these driving forces. Developmental biologists and physiologists have tended to approach the problem of circuit formation and function from very different angles, without much dialogue between them. But genetic tools are now available to reconcile the results from these two disciplines and establish a fruitful interaction. Information about signatures of gene-regulatory factors that determine the fates of neuronal populations can now serve as tools with which to elucidate the functions of a given set of neurons. The work presented by Gosgnach  et al . sets up a firm bridge across the river that has so far divided developmental biology and physiology. Reprints and Permissions"},

McCall"}], "parsed_as_year": "2006_or_before", "body": "Molecular physicists and astrophysicists alike would like to know how fast the H 3 +  molecular ion recombines with electrons. Fast, seems to be the answer \u2014 with an awkward consequence for the astrophysicists. Every schoolchild knows that, like opposing poles of a magnet, opposite charges attract. But what happens when charged bodies are small enough that the rules of quantum mechanics come to bear, for instance when an electron and a positively charged molecule attract? Here, the situation is more complicated: even the reaction between an electron and the simplest polyatomic molecule, H 3 +  (which can be thought of as a hydrogen molecule, H 2 , with an extra proton, H + ) has puzzled both theorists and experimentalists for decades. In a contribution to  Physical Review Letters , Kreckel  et al . 1  describe an ingenious experiment that provides further elucidation of the speed of this fundamental reaction. When an electron approaches a singly charged positive ion (call it X + ), both bodies experience an attraction that accelerates them and causes them to collide. They can recombine to form neutral X, provided that the extra kinetic energy that they have gained by being accelerated can somehow be removed. For macroscopic objects, this is not generally a problem: friction dissipates the energy. At the quantum-mechanical level, however, this cannot happen. If X +  is the ion of a single atom, energy can be lost only by emitting a photon, a slow process that seldom happens during the short time a collision takes. In most such collisions, the ion and electron fly away from each other again. If X +  is a molecular ion, however, there is a much more efficient option: the molecule can break apart following recombination with the electron, and the resulting neutral fragments can carry away kinetic energy. This is the process known as dissociative recombination. The H 3 +  ion assumes an important role in astrophysics as the first link in a chain of chemical reactions in interstellar clouds through which most of the molecules found in interstellar space form ( Fig. 1 ). Interstellar clouds were recently seen to contain much more H 3 +  than expected 2 , bringing the persistent enigma of its recombination rate back to the fore. Exactly how the dissociative recombination of H 3 +  works was explained theoretically only recently 3 , 4 , and, starting in 1973, many experimental measurements have yielded drastically differing values for the rate at which it occurs 5 . H 3 +  is produced in ionized gases known as plasmas. Different plasma conditions will lead to different degrees of vibrational and rotational excitation of the H 3 +  ions, perhaps accounting for some of the variation in the experimental recombination rates. If the rate of recombination were lower than assumed, especially at the lower temperatures of interstellar space, the overabundance of H 3 +  in diffuse clouds could be easily explained. But without accurate values for the rate, further progress in understanding the mystery of H 3 +  abundance is impossible. Hence the efforts to understand dissociative recombination in terrestrial laboratories. In order to best simulate the conditions in interstellar space, the ions in the laboratory must be cooled to a state of minimum rotation and vibration. Vibrational cooling was first achieved using the CRYRING storage ring in Stockholm, Sweden, by injecting mass-selected ions into an accelerator, and allowing them to relax to their vibrational ground state 6 . Achieving a low rotational temperature is more difficult: H 3 +  cannot cool rotationally by emitting radiation 7 , so the ions must be prepared in a rotationally cold state before they are injected into the storage ring. At CRYRING, this is done by sparking a discharge to ionize a jet of hydrogen gas as it expands through an opened valve into the vacuum of the storage ring and cools 8 . Once the H 3 +  ions are in both their vibrational and rotational ground states, an electron beam travelling at a well-defined velocity is merged with the ion beam, and dissociative recombination occurs. The neutral fragments produced are counted as a function of the relative velocity of the two beams, yielding the \u2018spectrum\u2019 of the rate of recombination as a function of the collision energy. Kreckel and colleagues' experiments 1 , performed at the Test Storage Ring (TSR) in Heidelberg, Germany, follow a similar scheme, but make two improvements over the previous studies. First, they produced their electron beam with a newly developed cryogenic photocathode, allowing more precise control of the ion\u2013electron collision energy and so higher resolution in the dissociative-recombination spectrum. Second, they used a new type of ion source, called a radiofrequency multipole ion trap. In such a trap, H 3 +  ions are stored before injection into the ring at low temperature in the presence of helium gas. The large number of collisions of the ions with the helium means that the rotational energy of the ions can be transferred to the helium, thus ensuring that the ions are rotationally cold. (In contrast, with the expanding jet source used at CRYRING, a small fraction of ions may remain rotationally warm.) The result of the TSR experiment is in excellent agreement with the CRYRING results, and, thanks to its higher resolution, reveals the fine detail of the spectrum more clearly. It confirms that the rate of dissociative recombination is fast under cool, interstellar conditions. Improved theoretical calculations 3 , 4  also yield a rate that agrees well with both experiments. Some minor discrepancies remain, but the general concord implies that the long-standing enigma of the rate of H 3 +  recombination might finally be resolved. If so, the onus is back on the astrophysicists: how can the large observed abundance of H 3 +  in diffuse clouds be explained if recombination is so fast? One likely solution would seem to be enhanced production of H 3 +  through ionization by cosmic rays 2 . Kreckel and colleagues' results 1  do contain an intriguing twist. At the low temperatures of their measurements (and of the interstellar medium), H 3 +  exists almost entirely in its two lowest rotational states, which have a total nuclear spin of 3/2 (ortho-H 3 + ) and 1/2 (para-H 3 + ). But by using para-H 2  in their ion source, and thus enhancing the ratio of para- to ortho-H 3 + , the authors saw a marked difference in the rate of dissociative recombination at low energies. Unfortunately, they were not able to measure the degree of the para-H 3 +  enhancement, and because of the nature of their ion source, it is probably not very large. Future experiments with pure para-H 3 +  would be highly desirable to elucidate the difference in the rate of recombination between the two states. That would indeed represent the first dissociative recombination measurement of a single quantum state. Reprints and Permissions"},

But evolutionary change can often occur through modified gene expression, a process that is now under investigation with species-specific microarrays. Gene expression, the major determining factor of protein abundance in the cell, is regulated by various mechanisms, such as protein binding to the DNA sequence and interference by small RNA molecules. On  page 242  of this issue 1 , Gilad  et al . describe their study of gene expression in four primates. Their work is aimed at identifying similarities and differences in gene expression between humans and their nearest relatives. As we elucidate the complex molecular machinery that controls gene expression, our ignorance of its role in evolution is becoming increasingly alarming. In most cases, we know little about the way in which gene expression is involved in how organisms adapt to new environments or otherwise evolve. It has long been hypothesized that adaptation over short evolutionary time may often proceed by modifications in the regulation and interaction of genes rather than in the protein gene-products themselves 2 . Proteins tend to interact in complex networks, and so small changes in the abundance of one protein may have profound consequences. At the DNA level there may be many different mutations that affect gene-expression levels, but very few potentially beneficial mutations that directly affect protein function. Nonetheless, for convenience, most evolutionary studies have focused on protein evolution, leaving gene expression as one of the great unknowns in evolutionary biology. Gilad  et al . 1  make new strides in this field of research. They compare gene-expression data in humans, chimpanzees, orangutans and rhesus monkeys to identify genes that have changed their level of expression in the human lineage. This research differs from earlier studies 3 , 4  in using microarrays designed specifically for each species. Microarrays consist of a number of probes that bind messenger RNA from specific genes (mRNA is the linking molecule between a gene and the protein it encodes). By determining how much mRNA binds to each probe, the relative abundance of mRNA from each gene can be assessed. However, if the same microarray is used for all species, results may differ between species because of species-specific mutations that affect the binding affinity of the probes. Although this problem can be partially circumvented by removing genes that have such mutations, species-specific microarrays are the only known way to obtain a fair comparison among several divergent species without the loss of any genes. Using this technology, Gilad and colleagues demonstrate that most genes are under natural selection to maintain a constant level of expression, but that a few genes show evidence of species-specific changes. The fact that selection in most cases is working to maintain expression levels near some optimum is not surprising \u2014 levels of expression of a gene that are too high or too low would presumably often be detrimental to an organism. Gilad  et al . also observe no systematic increase or decrease in the regulation of gene expression in either humans or chimpanzees, contrary to previous claims to this effect 3 , 4 , 5 . But the authors do find that some groups of genes, particularly those encoding gene-transcription factors, tend to include greater numbers of upregulated genes in humans. Transcription factors are proteins that themselves play a role in regulating expression levels. So this observation is further support for the view that many evolutionary changes that are specific to humans may be related to gene expression. Gilad  et al . 1  also find that genes that are significantly up- or downregulated in humans, compared with other species, are often genes that have changed rapidly at the DNA-sequence level 6 . So there seems to be a correspondence between genes with altered expression and genes that have been targeted by positive darwinian selection in their protein-coding regions. This makes sense \u2014 we would expect changes in the function of a protein to be followed by changes in its distribution and abundance. Likewise, we may expect genes that have suffered a loss or reduction in functionality to subsequently experience an increased rate of evolution in both the sequence of the protein it encodes and its expression level, because selective constraints on it will have been relaxed. What factors might be causing differences in gene expression between species? Such factors could include changes in the DNA close to the gene, for example changes in transcription-factor binding sites, or in distantly located elements such as gene enhancers, RNA genes or genes encoding transcription factors. Quantifying the relative importance of the evolution of these various elements will not be easy, but large-scale studies comparing many different organisms should reveal correlations between evolutionary changes at the DNA level and changes in expression level or pattern. The comparative analysis of expression data may thereby serve to detect functional correlations between DNA and expression levels in organisms in which it is difficult to carry out direct studies using standard genetic techniques. The result, I predict, will be a new perception of the mechanisms underlying evolutionary change \u2014 one in which the emphasis is on changes in regulatory elements, in RNA genes and in segments of DNA other than protein-coding genes.

Heresy? The view through the microscope suggests otherwise. On  page 191  of this issue 1 , Sheiko and colleagues show that the mechanical deformation induced merely by the adhesion of a complex molecule to a surface can trigger the break-up of that molecule. They thus provide convincing support for the seemingly heretical notion that the commonplace and unremarkable process of adsorption to a surface can bring about what otherwise occurs only with the greatest effort: the rupture of the strong, covalent carbon\u2013carbon bond.  The system designed by the authors 1  is elegant in its simplicity. They placed brush-like, polymeric macromolecules on various solid and liquid surfaces to which the molecules' side-chains (the \u2018bristles\u2019) were strongly attracted. This attraction drove the bristles to spread out so as to maximize their contact with the surface, in turn causing the polymeric backbone of the molecule to stretch until it was eventually strained too far. Direct imaging of the size of the molecules using atomic force microscopy proved that they had been torn apart, just as if the rope had failed in a game of tug of war ( Fig. 1 ). When a chemical bond snaps, a chemical reaction takes place. But exactly how can a purely mechanical effect have chemical consequences? That is the wider question investigated by a field known as chemomechanics 2 . Future research in this area might well focus on whether mechanical stress shifts the energy level of the transition state of a chemical reaction, through which reactants must pass before becoming products. This view has long been held for \u2018hard\u2019 materials, such as metals, ceramics and semiconductors (steel, for example, corrodes most easily when stressed and bent 3 ). Mechanical stress could thus lower the activation threshold of certain reactions, making it easier to kick-start them, or even, depending on the magnitude of the stress applied, switch them off and on. Organic systems such as that of Sheiko  et al . 1  add a new twist: whereas the basic unit of hard materials is the atom, that of an organic material is the molecule. The added complexity of a molecule's internal architecture means that the kind of stress transmission described by the authors could not have been observed in an atomic system. In biology, the fact that a mechanical stimulus has chemical consequences \u2014 for example, in cellular processes that sense mechanical change 4  or changes in the conformation and function of ion channels in lipid membranes 5  \u2014 is being increasingly acknowledged. Thus, investigations of the effect of stress on complex molecules have considerable appeal. In many organic materials and elastomers (rubbers or rubber-like plastic), the internal architecture of the molecule focuses large stresses on weaker chemical bonds, and stress-induced scission of chemical bonds in such materials is a costly problem 6 . We believe that the work of Sheiko and colleagues 1 , by pointing the way towards understanding this ubiquitous and deleterious phenomenon, could provide a general model for designing molecular materials that have an architecture better able to cope with mechanical stress. Such research has myriad technological implications, because the ideas suggested here comprise a new paradigm for solving those problems. What is in our opinion even more exciting is that there is a general proof-of-concept here \u2014 that slow or even forbidden chemical reactions can be activated by mechanical stress. Chemical reactivity clearly depends on the relative orientation of the reactants; so could mechanical deformation be used to place molecules in a more favourable alignment for reaction? For example, friction and confinement offer a versatile way to align molecules 7 , and tribologists, who earn their bread from the study of these things, have known for a long time that friction promotes chemical reactions 8 . The tribological question 7 , 8  is not directly addressed in Sheiko and colleagues' experiments, but will be an interesting motivation for further work. And what about using the heat released to accomplish useful chemical change? Carbon\u2013carbon bonds, by dint of their strength, release a lot of energy when they are broken \u2014 just as, in a bout of tug of war, energy is lost when the rope fails and competing teams fall to the ground. Although Sheiko  et al . did not set out to capture energy from breaking carbon\u2013carbon bonds, there is no reason that molecules could not be designed that use this energy for productive chemical means. In this area, too, Sheiko  et al . 1  have presented a fundamental proof-of-principle on which further efforts can be built and go beyond the more obvious, unwanted consequences of mechanical degradation.

Non-mythical peoples have found various other solutions. The Tibarini used to hang their old on gibbets, the Hircanians and Bactrians cast them, while still living, to the dogs, and the Scythians buried them alive. In Great Britain, such drastic measures have never been contemplated, although the plight of the aged has often given cause for much distress. During the past two or three decades we have become increasingly conscious of the wider repercussions of our ageing population and the resulting social and economic disadvantages.

Cornish"}], "parsed_as_year": "2006_or_before", "body": "Ways of evolving proteins, and assessing the vast numbers of variants needed to identify those with novel enzymatic activity, are themselves evolving. Oil droplets containing basic cell machinery provide a promising approach. The cell has the enviable ability to evolve through mutation of its hereditary DNA code. When we first learned how to mutate DNA in the test tube, and so manipulate the amino-acid sequence of a protein, we quickly learned how difficult it is to rationally alter protein function with just a few amino-acid changes 1 . However, modern DNA technology makes it possible to generate not one or two but 10 10  or more protein variants with an altered amino-acid sequence, and we can now carry out \u2018directed evolution\u2019 \u2014 of, for example, surrogates of green fluorescent protein that range in colour from cyan to red 2 . But what will it take to compete with the evolutionary power of the cell to create and identify even more dramatic changes in function? As described in back-to-back papers published in  Chemistry & Biology , groups led by Dan Tawfik 3  and Andrew Griffiths 4  attempt to extend the directed evolution of enzyme catalysis to chemistry beyond that naturally carried out in the cell. Proteins with new functions presumably evolve in the cell through the accumulation of mutations in genomic DNA generated by random genetic drift, followed by selective amplification of cells with the fittest variants when some selective pressure is applied. Directed evolution seeks to recapitulate this process on an experimentally accessible timescale by selectively introducing mutations into the DNA encoding the protein of interest at a high rate, and then picking the handful of protein variants that have acquired the desired new function 5 . Synthesizing 10 10  protein variants at the DNA level is, in fact, easy. Variations of the polymerase chain reaction, a technique for selectively amplifying a segment of DNA, make it possible not only to mutate select amino acids in the active site of a protein, but also to replace a whole loop in a protein or mimic natural recombination by swapping whole segments from a related protein sequence. (Note, however, that 10 10  sequence variants is a tiny number compared with all the possible sequence variants for even a 200-amino-acid protein composed of 20 different amino-acid building-blocks.) But with such large numbers, identifying the handful of proteins with the desired new function is very hard. The cell offers an elegant solution to this problem of finding the needle in the haystack. It acts as a self-replicating compartment that links a mutatable and amplifiable DNA code to the catalyst translated from that DNA, and to the myriad functions that determine the fitness of the cell. Some methods (phage display, for example) can directly or indirectly link each protein physically to its unique DNA sequence, even for 10 10  variants, and have been exploited for the  de novo  evolution of binding proteins 6 . But they do not lend themselves readily to high-throughput assays for enzyme catalysis. Traditional enzyme assays can be carried out one-by-one in microtitre plates using automation techniques. But signal-to-noise issues limit these assays to smaller numbers of protein variants in practice. For the vast range of chemical transformations not carried out in the cell, we do not have the assays to sort through the large number of protein variants, and the directed evolution of  de novo  catalysts eludes us. Tawfik, Griffiths and their co-workers have confronted this problem by developing an \u2018 in vitro  compartmentalization\u2019 (IVC) technology that basically strips the cell's machinery for transcribing and translating DNA to RNA to protein, and reconstitutes it in water-in-oil droplets that have about the same volume as a bacterial cell. This approach provides one solution for linking each unique protein variant to its DNA sequence, because statistically it is easy to create 10 10  water-in-oil droplets each containing a unique DNA sequence encoding a unique protein variant. Tawfik and Griffiths have already successfully used their IVC technology for test-tube evolution of proteins, but largely for enzymes involved in modifying DNA. In the new papers 3 , 4  they go further, providing not only a link between the DNA and the protein it encodes, but also a functional assay that can handle large numbers of variants. Both groups show that they can make water-in-oil-in-water emulsions that allow the encapsulation of fluorogenic indicator dyes used to detect enzyme catalysis in more traditional formats. They then submit some 10 7  droplets, each containing a unique protein variant, to a technique known as fluorescence-activated \u2018cell\u2019 sorting (FACS;  Fig. 1 ). Using FACS on these water-in-oil-in-water emulsions, they can carry out test-tube evolution to increase the catalytic activity of a known protein. Tawfik and co-workers 3  leave behind the IVC technology and literally encapsulate a bacterial cell. They show that this increases the concentration of enzyme that can be produced in each individual droplet to about 10 5  molecules. From just one round of mutation and FACS screening, they then isolate a variant of the natural enzyme paraoxonase with a 100-fold increase in hydrolytic activity from 10 6  different variants. Griffiths and co-workers 4  carry out FACS with cell-free IVC droplets, which synthesize about 100 copies of protein per droplet. Returning to a classic experiment in directed evolution, they evolve Ebg, a protein of unknown function made by the bacterium  Escherichia coli , into a \u03b2-galactosidase enzyme using a fluorogenic \u03b2-galactosidase substrate. With multiple rounds of mutation and screening, they isolate several Ebg variants showing a more than 300-fold increase in \u03b2-galactosidase activity compared with Ebg. So what is the best way to compete with the evolutionary power of the cell? Tawfik and Griffiths strip the cell of some of its basic machinery, and, by analogy to the cell, compartmentalize this machinery in a water-in-oil droplet. Their IVC system preserves the cell's means of linking DNA to protein, and then adds on  in vitro  chemistry to create the evolutionary pressure. At the other extremes are completely synthetic encoded systems 7 , 8 , 9 , or solutions that seek to expand the chemistry carried out by the cell 10 . The advantage of a completely synthetic system may be that it can go beyond the chemistry that can be synthesized or tolerated by the cell, although the range of chemistry naturally carried out by the cell is awfully impressive. The field of directed evolution is in a vibrant phase 11 , 12 . Beyond that, this tinkering with cells will provide useful technologies for genomics and biomedical research, and will inspire thinking about what might be synthesized to recapitulate the functions of the cell and how the cell might be co-opted for new functions 13 , 14 .

Pierre Potier, who died on 3 February 2006 at the age of 71, was at the forefront of the French school of natural-products chemistry during the second half of the twentieth century. He was a leading light in the development of anticancer drugs from natural sources, and also in encouraging communication between the public and private sectors. In France, these circles tend not to mix. Potier showed that cooperation between the CNRS, the main agency of publicly funded research, and industry could be highly fruitful if the two communities shared their knowledge and experience. The son of a watchmaker, Potier was born in Bois-Colombes, a northern suburb of Paris. He first trained as a pharmacist, graduating in 1957 from the Faculty of Pharmacy at the University of Paris. He then completed his PhD in chemistry as a student of Maurice-Marie Janot and Jean le Men, taking his first steps in the field of drug synthesis from natural products under the tutelage of Janot at the CNRS's new Institute of Natural Products Chemistry in Gif-sur-Yvette. Following Janot's death, Potier took up the baton in collaborating with the likes of Edgar Lederer, Derek Barton and Guy Ourisson on various projects. Potier himself first co-headed, then headed the institute from 1974 to 2000, and so was responsible for guiding the research of several hundred investigators in learning from, and imitating, nature. Potier was himself a highly innovative scientist. In 1965, he devised a modification of the Polonovski reaction, which is used to obtain the  N -demethylation (or  N -deacylation) of various plant alkaloid derivatives. The modification consisted of replacing one reagent (acetic anhydride) with another (trifluoroacetic anhydride), which facilitated the biomimetic synthesis of many indolic natural products that could not otherwise be made. This reaction was central to the later work involving the \u2018vinca\u2019 alkaloids. In 1976, Potier and colleagues created a new tool for drug development: the tubulin test for identifying anticancer treatments. Tubulin is the main component of microtubules, which have a central role in cell division. The test was devised by Potier and Daniel Gu\u00e9nard. It does not require sophisticated lab conditions, and allows the swift and cheap evaluation of a drug's capacity to inhibit cell division \u2014 and thus of its potential anticancer activity. The tubulin test led Potier's team to identify the anticancer activity of vinorelbine (Navelbine), a semi-synthetic derivative of the vinca alkaloids vincristine and vinblastine found in periwinkles. All three drugs inhibit cell division, and have been part of anticancer treatments since the mid-1970s. The production of vinorelbine was taken up by the Pierre Fabre Laboratories for use in treating lung cancer and breast cancer in particular. (Poignantly, Potier's first wife Marie-France, herself a pharmacist, had died of breast cancer in 1968. Potier remarried, and is survived by his second wife Odette and three children.) But perhaps Potier's greatest contributions came between 1979 and 1994 from a succession of discoveries involving the chemistry of the yew tree. With Gu\u00e9nard and Fran\u00e7oise Gu\u00e9ritte, he first synthesized docetaxel (Taxotere) using a semi-synthetic pathway based on a reaction with 10-deacetylbaccatin III extracted from the needles of the European yew. Taxotere, which was developed with the Rh\u00f4ne-Poulenc Rorer laboratories, is a highly potent antineoplastic drug used mainly against breast, prostate and lung cancer. With Andrew Greene, and using the same chemical steps, the same team then found a way to produce large amounts of paclitaxel (Taxol). The drug had previously been made from the bark of Pacific yew, so that entire trees had to be sacrificed. More recently, Potier became involved in studying the origin of the degenerative effects of diabetes. He identified a role for glyoxal and methylglyoxal (end-products of carbohydrate metabolism) in causing the enhanced protein degradation seen in diabetic patients. These molecules damage proteins unless they are detoxified by mechanisms involving glyoxalases. Potier patented several drug candidates for treating diabetes in 2005, but at the time of his death was still carrying out experimental investigations on them. Potier was an author on more than 400 publications and several dozen patents. Ever keen to encourage international cooperation, he created the Franco-Japanese Society of Fine and Medicinal Chemistry, and the Franco-American Chemistry Society. Both nationally and on the global stage, he was especially effective in fostering the collaboration between chemists, biologists and clinicians that is so necessary for successful drug development, and in encouraging links across the academic\u2013industrial divide. It was this background that perhaps led to Potier's appointment by the French government as director-general for research and technology at the Ministry of Research. He held this position from 1994 to 1996, giving priority to promoting publicly funded research and the status of science in France. He retired from the Institute of Natural Products Chemistry five years ago, but remained emeritus director. On his retirement, he noted with justifiable pride that the royalties paid by pharmaceutical companies marketing the drugs he discovered were able to fund the entire institute. Pierre Potier became an eminent man, with connections among top politicians and scientists in France and internationally. He received many prizes, among them the CNRS gold medal and the Ernest Guenther Award in the chemistry of natural products; he was also a member of the French Academy of Sciences and the National Academy of Pharmacy, as well as of five foreign academies. Yet he didn't take himself too seriously, retaining the gifts of whimsy and a readiness to laugh. Claude Bernard, a towering figure in physiology during the nineteenth century, was among the first Frenchmen to dream of reconciling the aims and methods of chemists and biologists. With his acute scientific brain and cross-cultural awareness, allied with his sense of humour, generosity and deep appreciation of literature and history, Potier holds a prominent place among Bernard's successors.

A world map, for instance, relies on some form of projection that transfers \u2014 with inevitable distortion \u2014 the unbounded surface of the globe to the bounded page. Mark Newman has taken this idea of distortion a stage further, producing a world map that gives each territory a size proportional to its population. The idea of such density-equalized \u2018cartograms\u2019 is not new, and can be applied to a host of variables, besides population, whose distribution is geographically uneven. The innovation in Newman's map (pictured) is the use of the diffusion equation, familiar from the physics of heat transfer and molecular mixing, to produce a map that smooths out population density, but keeps geographical distortion to a minimum. The map follows on from work in which Newman and Michael T. Gastner applied the diffusion technique to (among other things) maps depicting the results of the 2000 US presidential election ( Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA   101,  7499\u20137504; 2004). For the world cartogram, a grid of 4,096 by 2,048 squares was overlaid on a rectangular world map based on a cylindrical equal-distance (plate carr\u00e9e) projection. A starting population-density function was computed by dividing the population of each country equally between the squares covering its territory. Population was then allowed to diffuse away from areas of higher density to those of lower density, with national boundaries moving such that the net population flow through them was zero at all times. The displacement of the boundaries was recalculated throughout the diffusion process by integrating the diffusion-velocity field, until the population density was equalized over the land surfaces. Constituent parts of non-contiguous territories (such as nations divided between several islands) were treated as separate entities, and the oceans and unpopulated Antarctica were treated as a sea of uniform population density equal to the average density of the populated land areas. This ensured an end result that maintained the semblance of familiar geographical relationships. Apart from the domination of Asian nations \u2014 China and India alone account for about a third of the world population of some 6.6 billion \u2014 the map throws up many other interesting facets. The Americas are diminished; Russia and Canada, the two largest geographical territories, are reduced to Arctic buffer zones. Australia all but disappears, especially when compared with its near neighbour Indonesia. The value of Gastner and Newman's technique lies in its intuitiveness and the relative simplicity of the algorithm, which requires a computation time of minutes. The diffusion method may also be extended readily to three dimensions, to create, for example, a three-dimensional \u2018homunculus\u2019 in which each part of the body is scaled according to the size of the brain region devoted to it. The potential of such techniques for producing startling representations that challenge our preconceptions seems \u2014 unlike world maps \u2014 unbounded. Reprints and Permissions"},

In times of famine, soil-dwelling  Bacillus subtilis  bacteria (pictured) shut down, forming tough spores that can lie dormant for years. But before that, they stock up on nutrients by releasing a toxin that kills off their neighbouring siblings and then feed off the remains of the dead cells. But how do the toxin-producing bugs shield themselves from the poison's deadly effects? Craig Ellermeier  et al . ( Cell   124,  549\u2013559; 2006 ) have unravelled the surprisingly simple mechanism that protects the toxin-producers. When nutrients are in short supply, a protein called SpoOA is activated to coordinate the cells' response. This regulator seems to be controlled by a bistable genetic switch such that it is turned on in only about half of the cells in a bacterial population. The activated SpoOA triggers manufacture of the toxin (SdpC) and an \u2018immunity\u2019 protein. With some nifty genetics, Ellermeier  et al . have identified the immunity protein and worked out how it is regulated. The key to the process is the fact that the immunity protein is also a signal-transduction protein that controls its own synthesis. As toxin accumulates outside the cell, the immunity protein \u2014 which lies in the cell membrane \u2014 mops it up, preventing the cell from being killed. At the same time, the toxin works with the immunity protein to grab hold of a repressor protein in the cell and tether it to the cell membrane. The repressor normally inhibits the gene that encodes the immunity protein, but it cannot function when bound to the membrane. So the cell keeps pumping out more immunity protein. When all the toxin is mopped up, free repressor starts to accumulate, shutting down further synthesis of the immunity protein. Thus, the cell produces only as much immunity protein as it needs.

In the early 1960s, Nick Shackleton, then a graduate student at the University of Cambridge, UK, developed a mass spectrometer that could analyse the oxygen isotope ratios ( 18 O/ 16 O) in small numbers of foraminifera, tiny calcareous creatures that can be found fossilized in deep-sea sediments. This innovation triggered a revolution in our understanding of ice-age cycles and provided a cornerstone for the relatively new discipline of palaeoclimatology. Throughout his career, and until his death on 24 January 2006, Shackleton remained at the forefront of the field, supported by his lab manager Mike Hall. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1985 and was knighted in 1998. Among his many awards were the Crafoord prize in 1995 and Japan's Blue Planet prize in 2005. He remained at Cambridge as Professor of Quaternary Palaeoclimatology until his retirement in 2004. Nicholas John Shackleton studied physics at Clare College, Cambridge, graduating in 1961. In 1967 he received his PhD for a thesis entitled \u2018The measurement of palaeotemperatures in the Quaternary era\u2019. With his mass spectrometer, Shackleton was able to routinely measure oxygen isotope ratios of both planktonic and the much rarer benthic foraminifera. Given the isotopic co-variation of these organisms in the ocean surface and abyss, Shackleton realized that the dominant control on oxygen-isotope variations was not temperature, as suggested by Cesare Emiliani in the 1950s, but instead was changes in the isotopic composition of the oceans caused by preferential removal of the lighter  16 O in the water that makes up continental ice sheets. He had thus discovered a method for reconstructing the history of global (mainly Northern Hemisphere) ice volume through the succession of ice ages. At the end of the 1969 meeting of the International Quaternary Association in Paris, Shackleton found himself the only person in the audience at a talk given by John Imbrie, a palaeontologist. Imbrie presented a statistical method for estimating temperatures using census information on the same species of surface-dwelling foraminifera that Shackleton had been measuring. Shackleton and Imbrie realized that their methods could be combined \u2014 Shackleton's isotopic method allowed for the establishment of a temporal framework based on ice volume, whereas Imbrie's statistical methods would yield the temperature information. Thus, in effect, was born the CLIMAP Project, a multi-institutional programme that in the 1970s produced the first global map of sea surface temperatures during the Last Glacial Maximum, around 21,000 years ago. In 1973, Shackleton made the fundamental discovery that the dominant ice-volume cycle revealed by the oxygen isotopes lasted roughly 100,000 years. He analysed a sediment core from the western tropical Pacific in which Neil Opdyke had identified the signature of the most recent reversal of Earth's magnetic field, an event that occurred about 780,000 years ago. With an improved timescale that could now be applied to other deep-sea records, Shackleton, together with James Hays and Imbrie, were able to rigorously test the Milankovitch hypothesis \u2014 the idea that the great ice ages of recent Earth history were caused by subtle changes in the distribution of solar radiation across Earth's surface, in turn caused by orbital variations well known to astronomers. They managed to use oxygen isotope and other records to detect the anticipated changes in orbital periodicities \u2014 of 19,000 and 23,000 years (precession), 41,000 years (obliquity) and 100,000 years (eccentricity) \u2014 in continuous sediment sequences. This provided the benchmark evidence that orbital changes act as a \u2018pacemaker\u2019 of climate change. Shackleton recognized that the orbital pacing of climate change made it possible to calibrate climate records from sedimentary sequences using the timing of the orbital cycles. Applying this principle, he gradually extended the orbitally tuned age-scale back some 30 million years. This has provided accurate dates for reversals of Earth's magnetic field, and for the evolution and extinction of marine organisms. It is a technique that has revolutionized the practice of stratigraphy. Shackleton also pioneered the use and interpretation of carbon isotopes in palaeoclimate studies, an undertaking in which he moved on from studying the orbital forcing of glacial cycles to the positive feedbacks that amplify this forcing into dramatic changes in climate. He recognized that the carbon isotopic composition of the oceans is affected by the amount of carbon stored in forests and soils. And he was the first to use carbon isotope ratios in benthic foraminifera to assess the changing land reservoir of carbon between glacial and interglacial times. Shackleton also provided data that confirmed Wallace Broecker's proposal that the carbon isotopic difference between the surface and deep ocean could provide insights into the cause of the glacial\u2013interglacial changes in carbon dioxide reconstructed from ice cores. Later, by combining deep-sea and ice-core records, he demonstrated that orbital eccentricity, the least well understood of the orbital forcings, probably affects climate through its influence on atmospheric carbon dioxide. Shackleton, in his trademark sandals, was spirited and curiosity-driven. He let his students and an entire community share in his brilliance and vision. Through his meticulous work \u2014 he inspected every sample analysed in his lab \u2014 he was a champion of \u2018small science\u2019, showing by example that the most important data and the best ideas do not necessarily require high-priced enterprises. It is revealing that Shackleton was an avid clarinettist, and taught a course on the physics of music at Cambridge. Music, more than any other art form, reveals itself through time and cyclic change. We owe a debt of gratitude to Nick Shackleton for his efforts to read the complex score of the Pleistocene climate symphony, and for helping to identify its composer \u2014 the variations in Earth's orbit and rotation. The challenge remains to reconstruct the orchestral players: the factors within the Earth system that work together to produce alternately the deep freeze of ice ages and the equable climates of interglacial periods, the last of which hosted the rise of human civilization.

As described elsewhere in this issue ( Nature   439 , 929; 2006), Katsumi Tsukamoto has filled in a missing part of the picture of the species' ocean biology. When they are mature, eels migrate from fresh water out into the open ocean, travelling thousands of kilometres to spawn. But the when and where of the actual spawning event, although suspected in general terms, have been hard to pin down. This is partly because of the technical challenges of isolating and identifying the tiny, transparent larvae just after they hatch. Tsukamoto has tackled those challenges to pinpoint the timing \u2014 which aptly coincided with a new moon in June \u2014 and strategic location of  A. japonica  spawning. This fishing feat also meant that the newly hatched larvae could be photographed. As shown in this picture, teeth, jaws and pigmented eyes are evident within five days of hatching, when the larvae are still less than 5 millimetres long. Thanks to the efforts in the 1920s of a Danish oceanographer, Johannes Schmidt, the spawning area of the European ( A. anguilla ) and American ( A. rostrata ) eels was identified as the Sargasso Sea in the western North Atlantic, spreading over some 5 million square kilometres. But it seems that the nursery of the Japanese eel, as identified by Tsukamoto, is much more compact \u2014 spawning is confined to a seamount northwest of Guam in the Philippine Sea, a location that enables the larvae to ride the northbound Kuroshio Current to their freshwater destinations in eastern Asia. This discovery will be applauded by researchers specializing in eel biology, as well as by those intrigued by a life history that constitutes one of nature's wonders. But there is a commercial aspect too: eels are of great economic value, not least in Asia, and there is a pressing need for management and conservation of natural populations.

Systematic inoculation began in Hamilton, Ontario, in 1925, and the death-rate from diphtheria fell so steeply that after 1930 there were no more deaths and after 1933 no more cases. In Great Britain a full-scale preventive inoculation campaign was not inaugurated by the Ministry of Health until 1940 and was not fully under way until 1942. In 1940 there were still in England more than 45,000 cases of diphtheria, and more than 2,400 of these were fatal. As inoculation became effective, in spite of a counter-campaign, the numbers fell steeply and steadily until in 1954 there were only 173 cases; of the nine deaths, six were in children less than fifteen years old, and all in the minority who had not been inoculated.

Opella"}], "parsed_as_year": "2006_or_before", "body": "An innovative approach to the isotopic labelling of proteins places the determination of the structures of larger proteins \u2014 particularly those in solution \u2014 within reach, while improving the accuracy of the method. With completion of the sequencing of the human and many other genomes, molecular biology is able to return to its roots to focus on, as Francis Crick 1  put it, \u201cthe description of [proteins, viruses, bacteria and chromosomes] in terms of their structure, i.e. the spatial distribution of their constituent atoms\u201d. Significantly, this definition includes systems that range from individual globular proteins in aqueous solution or highly regular crystals, to large assemblies of macromolecules, such as virus particles and membranes, that behave like aperiodic solids 2 . Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy can be used on molecules in all physical states and degrees of order, and so is fundamentally capable of determining the structures of proteins in all these environments. Although powerful, the full promise of this technique has yet to be realized. In this issue, Kainosho  et al . ( page 52 ) 3  demonstrate a method to optimize the isotopic make-up of the proteins being studied. This allows far more information to be gleaned by both simplifying and sharpening the spectra. The potential of NMR spectroscopy for structure determination was obvious from the earliest results, when Pake 4  showed that the distances and orientations of pairs of nuclei could be determined from the perturbations that the magnetic field of one nucleus causes in a neighbouring nucleus. The initial  1 H NMR spectrum of a protein 5  showed that a dispersion of chemical shift frequencies results from the local spatial relationships of atoms that are not necessarily bonded to one another; thus, the chemical shift interaction provides a means to distinguish all of the atoms in a protein. The Achilles' heel 6  of protein NMR is the \u2018size problem\u2019, which has two distinct components. The first is obvious: the spectra of larger polypeptides are more complex, with more signals and consequently overlap within the same limited range of frequencies. This is compounded by the second, more daunting, \u2018correlation-time problem\u2019: larger polypeptides (and their complexes) tumble slowly in solution 7 , which results in broad linewidths. The correlation-time problem can be solved under certain circumstances for proteins that are immobile (on NMR timescales) by virtue of their being in the solid state or very large complexes. But the problem has so far been intractable for larger soluble proteins in their native aqueous environment. The past half-century of technological developments in NMR for investigating proteins has followed three parallel paths: instrumentation, experimental methods and isotopic labelling. The benefits of advances in all three areas are highly synergistic, despite their seemingly disparate nature. The selective replacement of hydrogen ( 1 H) with deuterium ( 2 H) in a protein 8  was the first real step towards the resolution of overlapping NMR spectra, preceding the advent of high-field magnets and the sophisticated magnetic pulse sequences employed today. Deuterium nuclei couple much more weakly with the external magnetic field (and with the nearby  1 H nuclei of interest), so that replacing most  1 H by  2 H has a substantial effect on the properties of the remaining  1 H nuclei. In various incarnations, the incorporation of deuterium remains among the most widely used methods in protein NMR, even though, up to now, it required several difficult trade-offs. When uniform deuteration is performed at very high levels, there are no  1 H nuclei left as sources of magnetization or the couplings that provide structural information. Intermediate levels of deuteration generate a mixture of proteins with the  2 H nuclei in different positions, complicating the chemical shift patterns, and the signal intensity decreases because there are fewer  1 H nuclei in the sample. Kainosho and colleagues 3  describe a strategy for optimal isotope labelling for protein NMR that addresses these problems. Their approach goes far beyond just improving sample preparation \u2014 it is a major step forward in the attack on NMR's size problem. In addition, it provides a path to structure determination with higher spatial resolution. The authors developed protocols for \u2018stereo-array isotope labelling\u2019 (SAIL), which incorporates deuterium into a protein's constituent amino acids such that each carbon or nitrogen nucleus in the final protein will have at most one  1 H nucleus bonded to it, the remaining hydrogen atoms having been replaced by  2 H. These amino acids are then used to make the protein in a cell-free expression system that maintains the careful positioning of the isotopes. The patterns of replacement are designed to provide the most information consistent with spectral simplification and isotopic dilution (Fig. 1 on page 52), and it constitutes a general approach to overcoming the limitations of deuteration in a way that also enhances the contributions of  13 C and  15 N labelling for both distance and angle measurements throughout the protein. Contemporary alternatives are more limited; their focus is on specific labelling of methyl groups in a highly deuterated background 9 , 10 , 11 . The SAIL technology improves NMR spectra because it decreases the number of signals without losing sensitivity for the resonances of interest, and it produces narrower linewidths because the dilution of  1 H nuclei attenuates the line broadening. Moreover, it makes the short-range distance measurements more accurate, and, combined with easier assignment of side-chain resonances, leads to higher-resolution structures. Kainosho  et al . demonstrate their approach by solving the structures of two proteins \u2014 calmodulin (relative molecular mass 17,000) and maltose binding protein (41,000) \u2014 at a resolution of about 1 \u00c5. This rivals the highest resolution of structures previously determined for smaller proteins by solution NMR or X-ray crystallography. The combination of SAIL with other NMR technologies means that protein structure determinations can be expected where accuracy is no longer limited by experimental methodology. Rather, the structures could reflect the fundamental dynamic properties of the backbone and side-chain atoms \u2014 portraying the essence of a working protein. Equivalent improvements in solid-state NMR studies can be readily envisaged. Kainosho and colleagues' study is a significant advance in the field of protein NMR. It demonstrates that by dipping your heel in the river while sailing, the protein size problem will fade away. This will allow the study of proteins selected on the basis of their biological functions or in genuinely unbiased surveys of proteomes, resulting from its ease of automation.

Fluorescence microscopy could help: the technique allows single catalytic events to be observed in real time. Catalysts are the workhorses of the chemical industry: more than 80% of all modern chemicals come into contact with at least one catalyst during their manufacture. They can also be extremely complex: solids with large surface areas, for example, possess many potential active sites in their crystal structure. In this issue, Roeffaers  et al . 1  ( page 572 ) premi\u00e8re a method of \u2018filming\u2019 single catalytic events in real time on a solid crystal, allowing catalytic activity to be mapped over its whole surface. The innovation is a step further on the road to the \u2018rational design\u2019 of catalysts, which offers the prospect of improved formulations for existing catalysts, and more effective and selective catalysts created from scratch. Rational design remains in most cases a pipe-dream: the experimental tools available for monitoring catalysts in action are still, in the main, too rudimentary. Nevertheless, this area of research \u2014 often referred to as  in situ  spectroscopy \u2014 has seen tremendous progress over the past decade, partially as a result of improvements in analytical instrumentation 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 . The latest contribution 1  exploits a method known as fluorescence microscopy. This technique has been used, for instance, in combinatorial catalysis, to screen whole series of catalyst libraries for the formation of fluorescence, and for monitoring the disappearance of specific organic molecules during catalytic transformations 7 , 8 , 9 . It has also been used to track the diffusion patterns of fluorescent molecules, and to determine their diffusion coefficients in different porous oxides 10 , 11 . Furthermore, fluorescence microscopy can monitor the adsorption and desorption of a dye molecule by individual crystals of a catalyst material 12 . The distinctive aspect of Roeffaers and colleagues' work 1 , however, is the use of high-resolution fluorescence microscopy to observe a catalytic crystal at work in liquid-phase reactions. The high sensitivity of their approach enabled the authors to monitor single catalytic events in real time by observing a \u2018reporter\u2019 molecule that becomes fluorescent only after catalytic action. They could thus beautifully map the spatial distribution of active sites over a single catalytic crystal. The authors tested the method on a layered double hydroxide (LDH) catalyst consisting of prismatic crystals with large basal planes and lateral faces (see Fig. 1 on page 573). Intriguingly, the tracks of the fluorescing molecules revealed that one reaction, ester hydrolysis, is catalysed only by active sites on the lateral faces of the LDH particle, whereas another reaction, transesterification, occurs on the entire outer crystal surface. In the terminology of surface scientists, ester hydrolysis is a structure-sensitive reaction, whereas transesterification is not. Such \u2018crystal-face-dependent\u2019 catalysis has already been observed on metal single-crystal surfaces, for example in the synthesis of ammonia, where the rate of product formation is found to depend critically on the orientation of the crystalline iron catalyst 13 . But the current work is, I believe, the first of its kind to use catalytic solids in liquid-phase applications. Whether fluorescence microscopy can be introduced as a more general method for  in situ  spectroscopy in catalysis research clearly depends on the availability of a sufficient range of fluorescent molecules that respond to different reactions. Attention should also be paid to the question of whether fluorescent reporter molecules behave like non-fluorescent molecules, and so indeed reproduce the distribution of catalytic sites reliably. Finally, fluorescence quenching \u2014 which may significantly affect the intensity of fluorescent emission \u2014 could become a problem, especially when the approach is extended to more severe reaction conditions. Currently, work on the  in situ  spectroscopy of catalytic solids is divided, roughly speaking, into two groups, probably reflecting the differing expertise of the chemists involved. The first group focuses on the inorganic part of the catalyst material, and aims to capture its oxidation state and the geometrical structure of its bonds (its \u2018coordination environment\u2019). This group uses techniques such as absorption spectroscopy and electron paramagnetic resonance. The second group, which focuses on the organic parts of the catalyst, uses nuclear magnetic resonance and vibrational spectroscopic techniques, such as infrared and Raman spectroscopy, to illuminate reaction mechanisms and potential reaction intermediates. With Roeffaers and colleagues' work 1 , the organic chemists gain a new tool for their  in situ  spectroscopic work. Further efforts should be directed towards combining both schools of thought, focusing, with nanometre resolution, on both the inorganic and organic parts of a catalyst. That could allow crucial insights into changes in the coordination environment of an active site, as well the reaction intermediates formed. The results could then be interpreted in terms of catalytic reactivity and selectivity in a \u2018joined-up\u2019 fashion. Although combining two or more spectroscopic techniques might seem simple, many hurdles must be cleared before it becomes a reality 14 , 15 . But the main challenge is to push the resolution of  in situ  spectroscopic tools into the nanometre range. Transmission electron microscopy offers resolution at the atomic scale (around a tenth of a nanometre). Coupling this with electron energy-loss spectroscopy, in which the sample is bombarded with a monoenergetic beam of electrons, allows chemical mapping of a catalytic surface. However, the energy resolution of this technique is still too low to identify the different oxidation states of the bombarded material. Moreover, electron-based techniques also need low pressures (in the millibar range), and thus the results obtained may deviate from those of experiments performed under true reaction pressures. So there is room for other spectroscopic tools that, in combination with Roeffaers and colleagues' fluorescence microscopy 1 , could deliver both inorganic and organic information about a catalytic process, creating a powerful  in situ  nanospectroscopy technique for taking snapshots of a wide variety of catalytic solids at work. If this endeavour succeeds, rational catalyst design will be a step closer to realization. Reprints and Permissions"},

This second type of behaviour is an example of chaotic, turbulent flow, the course of which \u2014 because of the huge number of interacting particles involved \u2014 cannot be precisely predicted. Denis Bernard  et al . instead perform numerical simulations of turbulent flow ( Nature Phys.   2 , 124\u2013128; 2006 ). Surprisingly, they find a connection between two-dimensional turbulence and a simpler, hitherto unrelated phenomenon \u2014 that of critical percolation. Percolation describes the flow of a fluid through a porous material, such as honey seeping through beeswax. In a honeycomb, percolation reaches a critical threshold at which half the cells are filled with honey and the probability that a row of honey-filled cells spans the whole layer is not zero (although it might be infinitesimally small). At criticality, the filled and empty clusters of cells assume a \u2018fractal\u2019 pattern that follows a principle known as conformal invariance: as long as the angles don't change, magnifying different sections of the pattern by different amounts results in a pattern that is indistinguishable from the original. The principle is demonstrated in this image of Bernard and colleagues' turbulent flow. Here, connected clusters of vortices rotating in one direction are coloured and those rotating in the other are black; the resulting pattern is indistinguishable on small and large scales. The authors calculate a fractal \u2018dimension\u2019, a measure of the degree to which the pattern seems to fill space as one looks at ever finer scales. The value they find, 4/3, corresponds exactly to that found in the distribution of a fluid such as honey at the critical percolation threshold. The discovery of this link could open the field of turbulence to the full theoretical artillery of conformal mapping, a technique that is central to a whole range of physical theories, such as string theory, besides critical percolation.

Thus both are stable to heat and to acids but less to alkalis, soluble in acetone and alcohol, both are active, at least under certain conditions, when taken orally, and both serve to inhibit development of the ovary and related phenomena.

I wish to point out that it is possible to express this advantage quantitatively on the assumption...that bullets are, on average, uniformly distributed over the target presented by a man's body, also that a man presents a target proportional in area to the square of his height. The Anthropological Institute has kindly given me figures for the purpose; the average height of 2500 Japanese... was 1585 millimetres as compared with an average of 1642 millimetres for the average of 177,948 European Russian conscripts. The average Russian height thus exceeds that of the Japanese by about 3.47 per cent. The squares of the two average heights, representing, as I have said, the average targets offered by each to an enemy, differ therefore approximately by 7 per cent, so that the Russian fire was relatively ineffective to that extent. \n               John H.

The latest observation of two-proton emission, however, will provoke some head-scratching. On  page 298  of this issue 1 , Mukha and colleagues report the simultaneous emission of two protons from a complex, long-lived state of the silver isotope  94 Ag, which has an odd number of protons. This type of radioactive decay is expected only for proton-rich nuclei with an even number of protons \u2014 so the observation leaves nuclear physicists with some explaining to do. Whether an atomic nucleus is stable or decays depends on the interplay between two fundamental forces: the short-range, attractive strong nuclear force and the longer-range, repulsive electromagnetic Coulomb force. Whereas the strong force acts between all the nucleons (protons and neutrons) that make up the nucleus, the Coulomb force acts only between protons. This means that in nuclei that are extremely rich in protons \u2014 said to lie beyond the \u2018proton drip-line\u2019 ( Fig. 1 ) \u2014 the strong force can no longer bind all protons, and such nuclei can decay through the emission of one or two protons. In these rare radioactive decays, protons tunnel quantum mechanically out of the nucleus, through the energy barrier formed by the combined effect of the strong and Coulomb forces. In the lowest allowed energy state of a nucleus, it is energetically favourable for protons or neutrons to pair up. Single-proton emission is therefore expected to occur among proton-rich nuclei that have an odd number of protons, whereas two-proton emission should be characteristic of nuclei with an even number of protons. Single-proton radioactivity was discovered 2  several decades ago in the decay of an excited state of cobalt-53 to the ground state of iron-52. Today, about 30 different single-proton radioactivities are known 3  for nuclei with proton numbers between 50 and 84, and the phenomenon is fairly well understood theoretically. In contrast, two-proton radioactivity was observed only recently 4 , 5  \u2014 from the ground states of isotopes of iron, nickel and zinc,  45 Fe,  48 Ni and  54 Zn, all of which have an even number of protons \u2014 and information on the energy and angular correlations of the emitted protons is incomplete. The emission of the protons was in all cases simultaneous; because of the extra energy required to break proton pairs, sequential emission is not energetically possible. A quantum-mechanical tunnelling model involving three bodies \u2014 two protons and a remnant core nucleus \u2014 describes the observations satisfactorily 6 , but for the process to be further elaborated theoretically, more precise information is required about the lifetime and decay energy of the system, and about the energy and angular correlations between the emitted protons. The two-proton radioactivity observed by Mukha and colleagues 1  was from  94 Ag nuclei, not in their ground state, but in a metastable, long-lived, high-spin state that the authors produced by bombarding a nickel-58 target with a beam of calcium-40 ions. They also contrived to measure the energy and angular correlations of a two-proton decay for the first time; the proton\u2013proton and proton\u2013nucleus correlations derived are characteristic of simultaneous rather than sequential emission. As  94 Ag was already known to undergo single-proton decay, Mukha and colleagues' state is the first for which both one- and two-proton decay modes have been shown to exist. All previous studies of the two-proton decay of short-lived nuclear resonances from which sequential decay is energetically possible have proved that these decays are indeed exclusively sequential. Sequential emission is probably suppressed in  94 Ag because the daughter state that is populated by the first of two sequential decays would be an excited state of the palladium isotope  93 Pd. Rather than emitting a second proton, this state would tend to decay electromagnetically \u2014 by emitting a photon \u2014 to its ground state. But why does the energetically unfavourable simultaneous two-proton decay itself occur with such high probability? Mukha  et al . tackle this question using a simple model 1  that neglects any interaction between protons, but that is consistent with the observed energy and angular correlations as well as the half-life of the  94 Ag nucleus. Their model describes the decay as two independent emissions at either end of a strongly prolate (cigar-like) super-deformed nucleus. The authors supply a similar calculation that assumes the emission of a correlated proton pair with a relative spin of zero (a so-called  2 He model). However, the small number of events, and consequent limited accuracy of the results, does not allow the two modes to be distinguished. Further work is also needed to independently characterize the structure and shape of the complex high-spin  94 Ag state and thus allow a more detailed interpretation of the process. Two-proton radioactivity can provide far-reaching insights into problems of low-energy quantum-mechanical tunnelling in strongly interacting systems. A full elucidation of the nature of such decays \u2014 whether from the ground state or from fast-spinning excited states \u2014 will be a major goal for further experiments at current and future radioactive ion-beam facilities.

Last summer, Ted Bullock and I walked under the wooden arcade covered by bougainvillea vines at Casa de Ma\u00f1ana, the retirement community in La Jolla, southern California, where he lived with his wife. All of a sudden, Ted stopped and pointed to the rich pattern of light and shade on the ground from the sun penetrating the plants. \u201cHave you noticed that the size of the light points enclosed by the shadows are never smaller than a certain minimum size?\u201d he said, and expounded the physical reasons he thought might cause this \u201cquantum\u201d phenomenon. For Ted Bullock, who died in the night of 19\u201320 December 2005, no problem was too trivial to be examined, no question too simple to be thought about. This never-ending curiosity was key to his success as one of the greatest neurobiologists of the twentieth century. Like no one before him, he pioneered a reductionist approach based on careful observations of a large variety of animal species under natural conditions to explore how nervous systems work, how they control behaviour, and how they developed during evolution. Theodore Holmes Bullock was born to American Presbyterian missionaries in Nanking, China, in 1915. During his first 13 years, immersion in the Chinese culture, with its atmosphere of mutual respect, laid the foundation for his lifelong cosmopolitan outlook. He considered himself, \u201ca citizen of the world first, of the United States second\u201d. After earning his PhD in zoology from the University of California at Berkeley in 1940, he spent four years at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut, with summers at the Marine Biology Laboratory at Woods Hole, Massachusetts. There, the ample opportunity to work on a large variety of organisms had a major influence on the development of Bullock's interests in comparative physiology. He continually searched for simple systems with which to explore the multitude of neural mechanisms that work together to produce an output, both at the physiological and the behavioural level. He argued that examination of the different mechanisms used by various organisms is as important as the search for commonalities in understanding how brains work. As a consequence, he studied an enormous number of different taxa over his lifetime, including cnidarians, crustaceans, fish, amphibians and reptiles. His research life entered a decisive stage when he was appointed to the zoology faculty of the University of California at Los Angeles in 1946. Twenty years later, he moved to the University of California at San Diego, where he headed the Neurobiology Unit of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography and became a major force behind the creation of the world's first department of neuroscience. One of the research themes to which Bullock returned time and again, was the role of direct current and low-frequency electric fields in intercellular communication in the nervous system. In the early 1960s, the dominant view of neuronal communication was that it takes place only through action potentials, with chemical synapses acting as switches to regulate the flow of information through neural circuits. Bullock, however, showed that neurons can also communicate through non-synaptic interactions, and without such impulses. Using the cardiac ganglion of lobsters as a particularly favourable model system, he demonstrated that graded potentials spread electrically from one neuron to another through proposed low-resistance cytoplasmic bridges. Today we know that this type of electrical interaction is mediated by gap junctions \u2014 electrical synapses that couple groups of cells into functional units. As an extension of this work, Bullock maintained a lifelong interest in field potentials resulting from the summated electrical activity of millions of brain cells. He argued that present approaches to analyse these electric activities are insufficient to extract all of the information possibly used for signalling within the brain. Furthermore, he demonstrated that certain patterns of field potentials underlying cognitive processes can be recorded not only from higher brain centres in taxonomically higher vertebrates, but also from sites involved in low-level sensory processing (for example, the retina) and in lower vertebrates, such as rays and turtles. On the basis of Bullock's research, this comparative approach has proven to be a powerful tool for uncovering principles of the evolution of cognition. Bullock's other scientific contributions include the discovery of two new senses in animals. In a series of papers in the 1950s, he and his associates showed that the facial pit of pit vipers, located midway between the nostril and eye on either side of the head, acts as a thermal sensor. The snakes use receptors in the facial pit to detect temperature changes caused by prey animals in the vicinity. A second landmark discovery came in the early 1960s, when he and his colleagues found a novel class of sensory organ in the skin of certain fish. Using a specialized organ, these fish produce weakly electric discharges that aid orientation and communication with members of their own species. The receptor cells of the electric sense organs respond to electric fields, even of extremely low intensities, and are tuned optimally to detect the fish's own discharges and those of neighbouring electric fish. A researcher who maintained the highest standards, Ted remained enormously productive until his death. He was an inspiring teacher who encouraged broad education and independence. Over his lifetime, he attracted a tremendous number of graduate students, postdocs and visiting investigators from all over the world, helping many of them to enter promising research areas, without necessarily pursuing the field himself. Above all, his attitude towards people was clearly that of a humanist. He was dedicated to his wife of 68 years, Martha, and their two children. He always had time for other people and, when asked, gave advice \u2014 not by dictating what to do, but by presenting a well-balanced analysis. The volume of his correspondence with friends, students and colleagues all over the world was immense and hardly decreased with age \u2014 as the photo above from last year shows, he remained youthful and vigorous even at 90. His last e-mail to me was sent just a few hours before his death, with detailed suggestions on a manuscript. He, who considered it a duty and a pleasure to help others, finished his e-mail \u201cthanks for the privilege\u201d. It was a privilege to be among those with whom he shared his wisdom, enthusiasm and love for science, nature and people. Reprints and Permissions"},

But with those reactions denied to them, plants have evolved an extensive and varied repertoire for responding to threats to their well-being. Apart from the tolerance mechanisms discussed above by Schroeder and Kuhn, such responses can include calling upon insect allies to deal with pests that would otherwise damage or destroy the plant by eating it. Christiane Schnee and colleagues have started to dissect one such signal system \u2014 that used by maize seedlings when they are attacked by caterpillars ( Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA  doi:10.1073/pnas.0508027103; 2005). The plant signals consist of volatile chemicals, which in the case investigated by Schnee  et al . attract female wasps of the species  Cotesia marginiventris . The wasps lay their eggs in the caterpillars, with predictably unhappy results for the latter. Maize emits a cocktail of volatile defence signals in response to an attack by herbivores, and the general difficulty in studying the process is identifying which constituent of these complex blends has which effect. From investigations of maize biosynthetic pathways, Schnee  et al . first isolated an enzyme, a terpene synthase dubbed TPS10, that is responsible for producing most of the herbivore-induced volatiles. But that was only an initial step. To look into the biological effects of these terpenes, the authors used genetic engineering to insert the gene that encodes TPS10 into  Arabidopsis , the standard lab plant for biologists. The transgenic  Arabidopsis  plants were then used in experiments in which female  C. marginiventris  could choose between the options offered in an \u2018olfactometer\u2019 (fresh air and untransformed  Arabidopsis  being the other choices). The main result to emerge was that the wasps indeed showed a strong preference for the plant that produced the TPS-mediated terpene \u2014 but only after they had learned the association between the defence signal and the host by having previously laid eggs in the caterpillar host. This approach, say Schnee  et al ., is an example of the value of using transgenic technology to study the effects of complex volatile compounds. Even when the compounds themselves or their constituents are not available, if the genes concerned have been identified, the ecological influences of these signals can nonetheless be investigated in genetically transformed plants.

This was because the finances of the Royal Society were so low that it was not only unable to carry out its original resolution to pay for printing the \u201cPrincipia\u201d, but was even unable to pay Halley, then assistant secretary, his promised stipend of \u00a350 a year. In July 1687, in the same month that Halley sent Newton twenty copies of the \u201cPrincipia\u201d to \u201cbestow on your friends in the University\u201d, he accepted seventy copies of Willughby's \u201cDe Historia Piscium\u201d, published the previous year by the Royal Society, in lieu of some eighteen months salary.

But quantifying human movement and dispersal, and then applying general principles to those data, is not straightforward. Elsewhere in this issue, a group of theoretical physicists describe how they have taken an ingenious approach to the problem (D. Brockmann  et al .  Nature   439 , 462\u2013465; 2006). They use the dispersal of dollar bills within the United States as a proxy measurement for human movement. The researchers analysed data on the peregrinations of more than half-a-million US dollar bills recorded over a five-year period on an online bill-tracking system ( http://www.wheresgeorge.com ). This allowed them to quantify even statistically rare events with high reliability. They found that the movement of dollar bills resembles enhanced diffusion, or \u2018superdiffusion\u2019. Long-distance jumps are disproportionately important in the distribution of travelling distances. And this distribution decays as a power law reminiscent of \u2018L\u00e9vy flights\u2019, which are characterized by many short steps interspersed with long-distance jumps. The result may seem unsurprising \u2014 most cash transactions are carried out locally, but every now and again someone departs and uses the bill at a distant location. The beauty is that actual numbers can now be put on the process. Although the observed distribution of travelling distances implies superdiffusion, however, this process is attenuated by the tendency of bills to remain in the same area for longer than might be expected given the overall pattern of movement. Thus, human travelling behaviour apparently involves disproportionately long waiting times between displacements as well as jumps without any characteristic distance scale. But how well do bill trajectories reflect actual human movement? Happily, the authors find that data on passenger travel on the US aviation network, and long-distance human travel information published by the US Bureau of Transportation Statistics, agree well with the results based on dollar-bill trajectories. This research is more than a curiosity \u2014 epidemiologists could in principle use quantitative information on human movement to understand better how infectious diseases such as influenza spread.

Nevertheless, inventive approaches to the extraction and sequencing of DNA from mammoths preserved in Siberian permafrost are allowing direct access to the deeper memories of elephant evolution.

Analysis of the complete mitochondrial genome of a mammoth by Hofreiter and colleagues ( Nature   439 , 724\u2013727; (2006) ) provides the answer: mammoths are more closely related to Asian elephants, but only just. Current wisdom has it that the lineages leading to mammoths and both extant elephant species diverged about 6 million years ago in Africa. The new data suggest that the African lineage split first, followed around 440,000 years later by the separation between Asian elephants and mammoths. Now that the phylogenetic relationships are slightly clearer, it would be interesting to discover how other extinct elephants fit into the picture. One thinks of elephants such as  Anancus  and  Palaeoloxodon  that foraged in temperate Europe during the Pleistocene \u2014 not to mention the mighty  Mammuthus trogontherii , which at up to five metres tall was possibly the largest species of elephant ever, making the woolly mammoth look, if not dwarfed, then at least somewhat petite. These questions may not be answered using ancient DNA, however. The permafrost environment seems to favour the preservation of ancient DNA in quantity, from mammoths as well as other species, as shown by Poinar and colleagues ( Science   311,  392\u2013394; 2006). But the likelihood of finding sufficiently informative DNA from species living outside the Arctic is almost certainly very much less.

In fact, some ionic liquids can be distilled, and even thermally separated. The unique physical and chemical properties of ionic liquids \u2014 molten salts characterized by melting points below 100 \u00b0C \u2014 can be used to enhance the efficiency of a wide range of electrochemical, analytical, synthetic and engineering processes 1 . This has generated huge interest in these liquids, with their first applications in industrial organic synthesis now being reported 2 , 3 . On  page 831  of this issue 4 , Earle and colleagues, a collaboration of researchers from Portugal, Northern Ireland and the United States, report that some ionic liquids are volatile, and so can be distilled. The findings shake up the received wisdom that ionic liquids are involatile as a class, and might extend their range of applications still further. Exactly how an ionic liquid behaves varies sharply according to its specific ionic composition: for example, both highly hydrophobic and highly hydrophilic liquids can be produced ( Fig. 1 ). Certain ionic liquids are known to undergo thermal decomposition through mechanisms such as the transfer of an alkyl group 5  or, in the case of protic ionic liquids 6  (whose cation is a proton-donating, or Br\u00f8nsted, acid), through deprotonation. For some imidazolium-based ionic liquids, in which a weakly acidic proton is bound to a carbon atom, the formation of highly reactive organic molecules known as carbenes in the presence of a strong base has also been reported 7 , 8 . The decomposition products are usually volatile, and, in some cases, re-formation of an ionic liquid in colder parts of the apparatus has been observed. Involatility had been assumed to be a property common to all ionic liquids that do not undergo thermal decomposition. Earle and colleagues 4  change that assumption, showing that certain ionic-liquid structures known for their very high thermal stability, in particular bis{(trifluoromethyl)sulphonyl}amide salts, can be evaporated and recondensed under relatively mild conditions. The distillation of 1-hexyl-3-methylimidazolium bis{(trifluoromethyl)-sulphonyl}amide, for instance, is reported to occur at 170 \u00b0C and at a pressure of 0.07 millibar. It should be noted that Earle and colleagues do not give direct proof for the presence of ions in the gas phase of their distillation processes. But they do describe several instances of ionic liquid evaporation and recondensation for which alkyl- and proton-transfer processes leading to neutral volatiles are both highly unlikely. Most interestingly, they report the separation by distillation of a mixture of two ionic liquids. This is also by itself no absolute proof that ions are present in the gas phase: the separation could, in at least one of the demonstrated cases, just reflect the different volatility of carbenes formed in a process of decomposition. Yet despite these reservations, the evidence for the volatility of at least some ionic liquids is convincing. At first sight, these findings 4  seem to contradict previous studies that have reported applications of ionic liquids reliant on their blanket non-volatility. Ionic liquids have, for instance, been used in extractive distillation processes, and tested 9  for their long-term stability over three months at 175 \u00b0C and 50 millibar. Those tests showed no significant loss of the ionic liquid. Ionic liquids have also been used in ultra-high vacuum conditions of 10 \u22129  millibar for X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis without decomposing or evaporating 10 . Detailed analysis, however, reveals that the ionic liquids and reaction conditions used in these previous studies differ significantly from those used by Earle and colleagues. The clear corollary of the authors' findings is that non-volatility is not a property that can be assumed for all thermally stable ionic liquids: vapour pressure is just another physical\u2013chemical property that depends on an ionic liquid's cation\u2013 anion combination, and will in the future have to be checked experimentally for each new liquid. Adjusting the vapour pressure of the ionic liquid will become an integral part of finding the best ionic liquid for a given application. Do these developments bring into question the view that ionic liquids are \u2018green solvents\u2019? That reputation is built largely on their non-volatility, because they do not create the atmospheric pollution that can result from the volatility of classic organic solvents. The answer is no: Earle and colleagues clearly state that the vapour pressure of ionic liquids remains negligible at near ambient conditions, and many ionic liquids show no signs of distillation below the temperature of their thermal decomposition. What the proven volatility of some thermally stable ionic liquids under relatively mild (and close to technically realistic) conditions will most assuredly do, however, is make these substances more useful for us. New purification methods and reactions that use ionic liquids in the gas phase are territories that are now ripe to be explored. The possibility of separating two ionic liquids by distillation will, in particular, unlock the door to new routes towards the manufacture of ionic liquids, and towards the regeneration of spent ionic liquids from technical processes.

These twinkling bugs communicate with one another using flashes of light \u2014 a trick biologists have appropriated to convey readouts from their experiments. Various forms of the enzyme responsible for the fireflies' luminescence \u2014 luciferase \u2014 can produce slightly different colours, ranging from red to yellow to green. Elsewhere in this issue, Toru Nakatsu  et al . ( Nature   440 , 372\u2013376; 2006) report several X-ray crystal structures of luciferase from the Japanese Genji-botaru firefly ( Luciola cruciata , pictured) that explain how small changes in this protein can change the colour of the emitted light. To create bioluminescence, magnesium, adenosine triphosphate and a small molecule called luciferin react with molecular oxygen. This reaction, which is catalysed by luciferase, generates an electronically excited oxyluciferin species. The yellow-green sparks we see in the night sky are emitted when oxyluciferin relaxes from its excited state to the ground state, losing energy in the form of light. Single amino-acid changes in the active site of luciferase can alter the colour of the light emitted by the protein, but the chemical mechanism involved has been a mystery. Now Nakatsu  et al . have obtained a series of \u2018snapshots\u2019 of the reaction \u2014 luciferase bound to the reactants (adenosine triphosphate and magnesium); an analogue of one of the reaction intermediates (known as DLSA); and the products (oxyluciferin and adenosine monophosphate). The structure of luciferin bound to the reactants and the structure of the products are similar, both possessing an active site that is \u2018open\u2019 to the environment surrounding the protein. But when the protein is bound to DLSA, the active site closes: DLSA is tightly packed against several amino-acid side-chains, including isoleucine 288. Analysis of the three structures revealed that the side-chains of isoleucine 288 and serine 286 rotate when DLSA is present, closing the active site and forming a pocket. The authors thought that the conformation of these amino acids might affect the colour of the light discharged by luciferase. So they solved the X-ray crystal structure of DLSA bound to a mutant luciferase known to emit red light. Their theory was borne out, as the active site of the DLSA-bound mutant protein was open. The authors propose that the colour of the emitted light depends on the formation of this compact microenvironment during the reaction. In the normal protein, the excited oxyluciferin is held tightly in this pocket, packed against the side-chain of isoleucine, and yellow\u2013green light is emitted. However, if this rigid pocket does not form \u2014 for example, in proteins that have mutations at isoleucine 288 or serine 286 \u2014 the excited oxyluciferin loses some energy, possibly because it can move around a little, and the protein emits red light, which is lower in energy. In further work, Nakatsu  et al . found that many of the other firefly luciferases that emit yellow\u2013green light have either isoleucine or the slightly smaller amino acid valine at position 288. So it seems likely that the movement of the 288 amino acid is a common mechanism for controlling the colour of luciferase bioluminescence. Reprints and Permissions"},

This unusual construction also endows soap bubbles with a uniquely large ratio of surface area to contained liquid. Tinakorn Kanyanee  et al . ( Anal. Chem.  doi:10.1021/ac052198h; 2006) set out to exploit this feature \u2014 by \u2018wiring up\u2019 soap bubbles and using them as the functional heart of a fully automated detection system for trace gases. The authors' bubble factory uses a sealed, transparent plastic box with water at the bottom to keep the environment moist and so prolong bubble life. Soap solution is first supplied to the box through the inner of two concentric tubes. As the solution spreads from this tube's slightly recessed tip, it coats the tip of the surrounding outer tube, through which a controlled blast of air is delivered, inflating the soap film and creating a bubble. Precise metering of the air pulse ensures that the bubble is inflated just enough to touch two opposing stainless-steel electrode rods that jut into the box. The bubble-box reproducibly generates long-lived bubbles of uniform size and wall-thickness, so that the conductance measured between the electrodes for a given bubble geometry depends on the bubble's chemical composition. To use their system for trace-gas analysis, the authors added the oxidizing agent hydrogen peroxide to the soap solution and exposed the resulting bubble to air containing traces of sulphur dioxide. The sulphur dioxide readily diffused into the bubble, where it was oxidized and sulphuric acid was produced. The presence of acid increased the bubble's electrical conductance. This effect enabled quantitative determination of part-per-billion levels of sulphur dioxide within minutes. The approach should also be applicable to a range of other soluble and reactive gases. But as Kanyanee and colleagues point out, the wider message is that soap bubbles are an attractive, yet largely unexplored, tool for concentrating trace gases to enable their detection. Whether these species are then detected through conductance measurements, or through bursting the bubble and analysing its liquid by other means, there is, in that sense, more to this story than mostly froth and bubble.

The reversed film will show contracting circular waves of increasing amplitude. Moreover, immediately behind the highest wave crest, a circular region of undisturbed water will close in towards the centre. This cannot be regarded as a possible classical process.

Simpson and colleagues have a gory story to tell ( Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA  doi:10.1073/pnas.0508915103; 2006). They investigated the factors that contribute to the mass movements of flightless Mormon crickets ( Anabrus simplex ), which inhabit western North America. Under certain conditions, these insects form into marching bands millions strong and several kilometres in length, and can walk up to 2 kilometres a day. From their studies, Simpson  et al . conclude that group movement is driven not only by \u2018pull\u2019 from in front, in the form of the search for specific nutrients (protein and salt), but by \u2018push\u2019 from behind \u2014 cannibalism. The crickets are themselves \u201cwalking packages of protein and salt\u201d. So unless an individual is in the forefront of the band as it rolls into new territory, its only recourse to satisfy its dietary needs may well be to make a meal of a fellow traveller. As this picture shows, Mormon crickets have a taste for their own. It was taken near Reno, Nevada, and shows one unfortunate individual, killed by a car, being consumed by another cricket (a phenomenon that sometimes occurs on a mass scale). To identify which nutritional components might drive mass movement, Simpson and colleagues conducted feeding-preference tests for nutrients placed in the path of a marching band. The results showed, for example, that marching crickets have a decided requirement for protein over carbohydrate, and for salt solution over water (to the extent that the insects fought for the preferred salt concentration). Other experiments demonstrated that crickets that had had their fill of protein and salt were much less likely to be cannibalistic. And other experiments again, using crickets with compromised movement, showed that the crickets safest from cannibal attacks were those that were able to defend themselves with their hind legs. But inactivity or reduced mobility meant that the cricket concerned was literally dead meat. Cannibalism presumably sets a high cost on group life, so why do the bands of mormon crickets stick together? Simpson  et al . answer this question by pointing to previous work involving the use of radiotelemetry which showed that the price of leaving the migratory group is the high likelihood of being killed by a predator. Better, then, to opt for the protection conferred by being one of a crowd, even at the risk of being consumed by one of your own \u2014 or, as the authors put it, being a member of a cricket migratory band \u201cis a compromise that makes the best of a seemingly very bad situation\u201d.

[this dealt with] the necessity for limiting the prevalent idea that \u201crecreation is a change of occupation.\u201d This dictum is useful and true so long as occupation does not amount to fatigue, but its utility ends at this point. When the system becomes fatigued, and this is especially true of the brain, the toxic bodies produced affect unused as well as used cells. It is futile to throw these cells, already prejudiced, into activity. Such action simply adds to the amount of poisonous or toxic bodies in circulation. This point was worked out with great clearness by Dr. Bevan Lewis... The practical outcome of his argument, as well as of Dr. Acland's, was that physical exercise was no substitute for sleep, but that active physical exertion added to severe mental strain demanded a double need of slumber. In illustration of this point Dr. Acland recounted how Mr C. B. Fry, at once a scholar and an athlete, frequently slept till midday or even late in the afternoon during his school vacations, and in doing so gratified nothing more than the healthy demand of his frame \u2014 physical and mental \u2014 for rest.

But how did these evolve from the single-chambered pumps seen in simpler organisms? While examining the development of the heart of the sea squirt, Brad Davidson and colleagues ( Genes Dev.   20,  2728\u20132738; 2006) may have chanced on the answer. The adult sea squirt ( Ciona intestinalis , pictured) is a classic squishy invertebrate, but as a larval tadpole it resembles a fish embryo. This puts it closer to humans on the evolutionary scale than other genetic model organisms such as fruitflies and worms, and makes it a useful system for studying certain developmental processes. Davidson  et al . followed the single-chambered sea-squirt heart as it grew from two cells in the early embryo. These cells divide and specialize to form muscle cells in either the heart or the tadpole tail. The authors find that the decision about which muscle type develops centres on a gene-regulatory factor called Ets1/2 \u2014 cells in which the factor is active become heart cells. But Ets1/2 is also present, though inactive, in the cells destined to become tail. So something must activate it to set embryonic cells on the path to becoming heart cells. Davidson  et al . teased apart the genetics to discover that the activating signal comes from a classic growth factor called FGF. Both Ets1/2 and the FGF signalling pathway have relatives in vertebrates, and these have been linked to heart development. This implies that the developmental pathway in the sea squirt has been conserved through evolution. The twist in the tale came from an experiment in which Davidson and colleagues looked at the effect of a permanently active form of Ets1/2 on embryonic cells destined to become tail. Not only did these cells develop into heart cells, confirming the role of Ets1/2, but in some animals the resulting organ had two chambers rather than one. So the authors speculate that since it separated from the sea-squirt lineage, an ancestral vertebrate recruited additional heart precursor cells to make a two-chambered heart. As their study shows, even a subtle change in signalling in the pool of cells that can form muscle cells might have allowed this transition. Reprints and Permissions"},

But does the same physics pack both objects' punches? It seems that it does. The existence of black holes \u2014 agglomerations of mass so concentrated that their gravitational pull allows nothing, not even light, to escape from them \u2014 is perhaps the most intriguing prediction of Einstein's general theory of relativity. Since the early 1960s, astronomers have identified two types of compact source that are probably black holes. These are galactic black holes (GBH), which have masses between 5 and 20 times that of the Sun, and active galactic nuclei (AGN), which weigh in at many millions of solar masses. On  page 730  of this issue, M c Hardy  et al . 1  present observations of X-ray emissions from these sources that indicate that, despite the huge disparity in their masses, the physical mechanisms that power these two classes of object are the same. Evidence for AGN is to be found at the centre of most galaxies, including our own Milky Way 2 . AGN are point-like sources that radiate light equivalent to that of several billion stars \u2014 as much as their host galaxy. The maximum luminosity of GBH, on the other hand, is typically more modest, equivalent to that of a few tens of thousands of Sun-like stars. This radiation, it is important to note, does not emerge from the black hole itself. In both cases, the radiation is probably a by-product of a process known as accretion, in which matter from the host galaxy or a companion star is attracted towards the deep gravitational well of the black hole 3 . A full understanding of accretion is one of the fundamental goals of astrophysics. The process is ubiquitous in the Universe, and many astrophysical objects have undergone episodes of accretion at some point in their life. The bare bones of the process are thought to be these: owing to conservation of angular momentum, material cannot fall straight into a compact, massive object such as a black hole, but forms a disk in which angular momentum is transported outwards as the accreted material spirals inwards 4 . At the disk's inner edge, the accreted gas reaches temperatures of 10 6 \u201310 7  K, and so emits radiation at X-ray energies. The energy thus released is between 7% and 42% of the total energy of the gas at rest, making accretion onto a compact object the most efficient energy-producing process known. (For comparison, when hydrogen atoms fuse in the centre of our Sun, the energy released is just 0.7% of their rest energy.) Thus, despite their huge luminosity, AGN need to accrete material at a rate of just 1\u20132 solar masses a year to fuel themselves. Because X-rays come from the hottest parts of the accretion disk, they provide diagnostic information about physics close to the black hole itself. AGN and GBH have similar X-ray spectra, so most astronomers believe that the physics of emission is similar in both. But secondary effects, such as absorption in the material surrounding the black hole, complicate comparison of AGN and GBH spectra, and direct proof for the two sources' similarity has been lacking. M c Hardy  et al . 1  study the time variability of AGN and GBH. The idea is that, if the physics of AGN and GBH emission is similar, the variability in the emission should be similar too. The typical timescales of the variation should, however, scale with mass 5 . GBH are aperiodically variable on timescales from days down to around 0.01 seconds, so similar variability patterns in AGN are expected on timescales of months to years. For this reason, their variability has been studied less, as measurements routinely performed in a few hours for GBH require observational campaigns of several years for AGN. Such measurements have become available only within the past decade through satellites such as NASA's Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE). To measure the contribution of variations at a given frequency,  f , to a source's overall variability, astronomers use a mathematical transformation of the source's light curve known as its power spectral density. With black holes, the most common feature of this function is a break 6 , 7  at which it turns from a shape roughly proportional to  f \u22121  to one proportional to  f \u22122 . Previous searches 5  had shown that this break tends to occur at a lower frequency (on a slower timescale) the greater the mass of the object. But a large scatter in the data points remained, making it difficult to extrapolate from this apparent correlation any general conclusion on the similarity of the mechanisms underlying GBH and AGN. M c Hardy  et al . 1  show that the reason for this scatter is that the break frequency depends strongly on luminosity. Once the authors took this into account, they could describe the observed variability of ten AGN, extending over more than three magnitudes in mass accretion rate, with one relation. Extending the sample to GBH allowed the variability properties of these sources to be explained, too. It would be hard to credit that two different physical processes should show essentially the same timing behaviour when extrapolated over such a large range of masses. Thus, these results provide a strong indication that the physics responsible for X-rays from stellar-mass and supermassive black holes is identical. The message is that for a full understanding of accretion onto compact, massive objects, objects of all sizes must be studied. At least here, the classical separation of astronomy into 'galactic', dealing with objects on the scale of GBH, and 'extragalactic', engaged with larger objects such as AGN, is artificial. But with only ten AGN and two GBH, the number of objects in M c Hardy and colleagues' sample 1  is small. Further work is required to refine their relation by increasing the number of long-term AGN light-curves, and by adding data from more GBH-monitoring observations. Data from individual GBH should constrain the relationship between the characteristic timescale and the accretion rate: the shorter timescales of GBH mean that dramatic luminosity changes caused by changes in accretion can be observed in a single object 8 . Providing better data on AGN variability might be more challenging: understandably, it is difficult to convince the time-allocation committees of major satellites to commit themselves to such time-intensive long-term projects. RXTE is a commendable exception here. For the next generation of satellites, dedicated, all-sky X-ray monitors are being discussed. These instruments will provide AGN light-curves without requiring repeated observations of single sources. Should these instruments come into being, together with dedicated instruments for the study of bright galactic sources, more intriguing insights should emerge from black holes.
