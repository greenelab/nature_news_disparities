Although much of the progress is still guarded by military necessity, space flight is emerging as an activity in its own right \u2014 one that can command the efforts of many scientists and engineers... A recent survey shows that the study of physics in American public high schools has been declining for more than half a century... why [does our youth] turn away from a career in science? We can only grope for the answer. Perhaps they sense, better than their elders, that too much of our scientific talent is engaged in the unproductive task of developing weapons for war. Is there much inspiration to devote one's life to this end, when we are rapidly approaching the borderline of total destruction? I believe that space flight might serve in no small measure to turn men's minds toward a more appealing scientific goal. As the exploits of Cabot, Drake and Davis inspired many generations of Englishmen to turn to the sea, so may the first astronauts reawaken our youth to the romance of scientific exploration. \n               Milton W.

This page displays a collection of the stamps and associated philatelic memorabilia issued by the world's postal services to commemorate the occasion (see also  http://fizjlk.fic.uni.lodz.pl/rut/Stamps/wyp/wyp2005.html ). The event may have been global, but the iconography of the stamps is, in many cases, distinctly national. The Republic of Ireland, for example, takes the opportunity to celebrate the 200th birthday of William Rowan Hamilton, the prodigious mathematician and physicist. Apocryphally, the formula for the multiplication of quaternions (four-dimensional complex numbers used in an early form of vector algebra) depicted on the Irish 48-cent stamp came to Hamilton as he was walking along the Royal Canal in Dublin. He carved it into the stone of the nearby Broome Bridge \u2014 an intellectual cut above most graffiti. Slovakia likewise commemorates one of its own, Dion\u00fdz Ilkovic\u0306, with a first-day cover that includes his expression for the mean-limiting diffusion current in polarography, an electrochemical analysis technique. India trumps this with a triumvirate: Satyendra Nath Bose, of boson fame; Homi J. Bhabha, the nuclear physicist who lent his name to electron\u2013positron scattering; and Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar, the astrophysicist who looked into black holes. Unsurprisingly, however, the iconic status of one physicist transcends national boundaries. The World Year of Physics does, after all, celebrate the hundredth anniversary of Albert Einstein's  annus mirabilis , during which he published five papers \u2014 covering atomic behaviour, the quantization of light, and the nature of space and time \u2014 from which classical physics never recovered. The most famous product of that fertile year, the equation that embodies mass\u2013energy equivalence, is no less iconic than its creator \u2014 though not, admittedly, as  m = L /c 2 , the form in which it appeared in 1905. Many countries are eager to stamp their claim on the greatest physicist of the twentieth century: Germany, naturally, where he was born in 1879 and whence he fled in 1933; and Switzerland, scene of his greatest triumphs, which famously emanated from the patent office at Bern. The Czech Republic remembers his association with Prague, where he obtained his first full professorship in 1911, and where he consorted with the writers Max Brod and Franz Kafka in Bertha Fanta's salon on the Altst\u00e4dter Ring. And Italy chooses for its 85-cent stamp (next to a Feynman diagram and a depiction of the birth of a black hole) a woodcut of the university town of Pavia, near Milan, where Einstein's family settled in his late teens. Cuba even breaks with the Year of Physics theme, commemorating instead the seventy-fifth anniversary of a visit by Einstein to the island. With his luxuriant moustache and untidy hair, and expression ranging from the lugubrious to the avuncular, Einstein \u2014 preferentially depicted as an old man here \u2014 is instantly recognizable. This remains so even when pictured with half his head missing (Poland), or when the depiction is schematic in the extreme (Cuba, Israel). Which raises the question, is there a minimal Einstein? What are the bare essentials required to make an image that remains unmistakably him?

Almost all our theories of the origin of the stars, the planets and the chemical elements have been developed in the past half-century. These were the diverse arenas in which Alastair G. W. Cameron worked, and where his ideas \u2014 he was a well-spring of ideas \u2014 inspired and guided two generations of colleagues. Cameron, who died on 3 October in Tucson, Arizona, was born in Winnipeg, Canada. He received his PhD in nuclear physics from the University of Saskatchewan in 1952, and took a faculty post at Iowa State College in Ames. While there, he read of the discovery of the highly unstable element technetium in the atmospheres of a certain class of red-giant star. He was inspired by this to wonder about the source of the flood of neutrons that would be required to maintain a spectroscopically observable concentration of the element. Ignorant of astrophysics, Cameron acquired a shelf of textbooks and set about educating himself. Without regret, he thus turned his back on experimental physics, embarking on a lifetime career as a theorist. While at Iowa, Cameron also met Elizabeth MacMillan at a science-fiction convention; she would become his wife. In 1954, Cameron joined the Canadian atomic-energy project at Chalk River, Ontario. There he worked on calculating the reaction rates that control nucleosynthesis inside stars. (Nucleosynthesis is the creation of chemical elements through nuclear processes such as fission, fusion and neutron capture.) After a brief stay at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, he moved in 1961 to the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York City's Upper West Side. Given Cameron's increasing interest in the creation of the Solar System, the fact that the institute's home was called the Interchurch Building was a source of mild amusement for his colleagues. Cameron's approach to understanding the formation of chemical elements was guided by their present-day abundances in the Solar System, which had been reviewed in 1956 by Hans E. Suess and Harold C. Urey. In working to update and improve their table, Cameron came to appreciate the importance of data from meteorites. Seeing the need to improve communication between the meteoritic and astrophysical communities, he instituted a series of interdisciplinary meetings in New England under the aegis of the Gordon Research Conferences, first during the 1960s and again in the 1990s. In the 1960s, Cameron also wrote his first semi-quantitative papers modelling the solar nebula, the disk of matter from which the meteorites and planets of the Solar System formed. These papers came to be taken very seriously by the meteoritics community \u2014 perhaps more seriously than Cameron, who saw them rather as steps towards the right answer, intended them to be taken. In 1966, Cameron (now a US citizen) moved to the Belfer Graduate School of Science at Yeshiva University in Manhattan, and in 1973 became a professor at Harvard University and associate director of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics. He remained at Harvard until his \u2018retirement\u2019 in 1999 \u2014 when he shifted his activities, undiminished, to the Lunar and Planetary Laboratory at the University of Arizona. Any account of Cameron's career would be incomplete without noting his love affair with digital computers. The complex, interlocking nonlinear equations that describe the reaction networks in stellar nucleosynthesis and the behaviour of protostellar disks require numerical integration, which in turn needs computing power. Cameron had been an eager consumer of that commodity ever since his first encounter with a card-fed IBM 650 in his Chalk River days. As soon as he could, he acquired his own minicomputers, preferring these to the shared mainframes at his various institutions. Cost-effectiveness was his justification; in truth, it just pleased him to be the master of his own computing. And no one was more knowledgeable on the subject: for about a decade, computers dominated his social conversation. Visitors to his office frequently complained that the whine of massed cooling fans made conversation difficult. But Cameron was a man of uncommonly broad interests, and his activities and enthusiasm routinely overflowed the boundaries that confine most workers. From discussions of the solar nebula it was a short step to questions of planetary formation, and so to the origin of the Moon (which had not been explained by the results of the Apollo Moon missions of the 1960s and '70s). Cameron and others suspected that a gigantic collision between sub-planets during Earth's accretion must have blasted off debris, creating an orbiting circumterrestrial disk from which the Moon formed. The proposition was difficult to test quantitatively: the trajectories of a huge number of debris fragments needed to be followed, in a complex gravitational field and under the effects of an expanding vapour cloud. The problem posed a fine challenge to Cameron's computational prowess, and he rose to it royally, making clear in a series of co-authored papers dating from 1976 that the Moon could have been created in a collision. In the light of the severe problems attached to other models, it became generally accepted that this was indeed the case. This was arguably the closest Cameron came to reaching closure on a major problem. His many papers on nuclear astrophysics (his first and continuing love), star formation, and protostellar-disk theory contributed profoundly to those fields; but Cameron knew his interpretive papers were successive approximations to the truth, not final answers, and right to the end he continued rethinking his vision of the cosmos. Appropriately, at the end of his life, Cameron was awarded the Hans A. Bethe Prize of the American Physical Society for his work in astrophysics and nuclear physics. He lived long enough to learn of this honour, but not to attend the prize ceremony, which was scheduled for the society's April 2006 meeting. Bethe, who wrote the classic 1939 paper on hydrogen burning in stars, had been the first to put his foot on the path that Cameron trod for so many years. Reprints and Permissions"},

Modern ecology emerged in the 1960s and 1970s as a fusion of scientific natural history, applied biology and more rigorous approaches from population biology and mathematics. Richard (Dick) Southwood, who died on 26 October, was a major figure in forging the new subject. He was influential both for his own research and for the research groups that he built and fostered. Southwood's background was as an entomologist, in particular as an expert on the Heteroptera or true bugs, a group that contains many pest species. His PhD on their systematics and ecology, undertaken at Rothamsted Experimental Station in Hertfordshire, UK, was very much in the mould of classical entomology; likewise the first research he did when, in 1955, he moved to Imperial College London to study the cereal pest  Oscinella , the frit (not fruit) fly. Although he continued to study applied problems, for example mosquito dynamics and improving the habitat for partridges, Southwood increasingly turned to the more fundamental issues in ecology for which he is best known. Here his work was invariably motivated by his encyclopaedic knowledge of insect faunas. In the early 1960s he began studying why different species of tree support remarkably different numbers of herbivorous insect species. Using many sources, he compiled a database for insects on trees in different regions, which indicated the roles of history, biochemistry and whether a tree species has few or many close relatives in Britain. Today, this method would be called macroecology, but then it was an unusual and new approach. Over the next 20 years, studies of insect herbivore communities by Southwood and the many others he inspired became test cases in community ecology. They were used, for example, to explore the degree to which the theories of island biogeography could be applied to non-overlapping resource types and the extent to which terrestrial insect communities are structured by interactions with their environment, as opposed to being mere assemblages of species drawn at random from those that can survive in a particular habitat. Heteropteran bugs vary greatly in their dispersal capabilities, with many being strong fliers and others completely wingless. Ever since his PhD, Southwood had been interested in the evolution of life histories, and in particular how the scale and spatial structure of the habitat of different species led to selection for varying reproductive and dispersal strategies. He summarized this approach in 1977, in a major review article, \u201cHabitat, the templet for ecological strategies?\u201d, which became a citation classic. This work was notable for linking the traditional informal approach to studying life histories with the growing mathematical theory based on optimality arguments and trade-offs between different demands on an organism's limiting resources. Southwood remained at Imperial until 1979, building a strong group in pure and applied ecology. For the rest of his career he was based at the University of Oxford, initially as head of the Department of Zoology, where he continued to apply his talents as a scientific leader and group builder. He eventually became vice-chancellor of the university, a post that, particularly at Oxford, requires the wisdom of Solomon. He also became increasingly involved in scientific policy, and was an adviser to the UK government on many issues involving the environment and health. In the early 1980s, he chaired the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution that produced a report on the consequences of lead in petrol. It was this report that led to the adoption of lead-free petrol in the United Kingdom, as well as in many other countries. In 1988, Southwood was asked to chair the working group set up to advise on control measures and the risks of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), which was ravaging UK cattle herds. This was a highly sensitive issue, with obvious risks for public health if the disease could jump the species barrier to humans, but also with serious economic consequences for British farming if the risks were overstated. Southwood's group strongly criticized the changes in rendering practices that had led to cattle and sheep products being fed to cattle, and recommended that certain parts of the cow should not enter the human food chain. Most of these recommendations were implemented, although with less urgency than Southwood wanted; he was particularly critical of the decision to compensate farmers for only half of the economic value of infected cows, a clear disincentive for farmers to report the disease. The working group also considered that the risk of BSE jumping to humans was most unlikely, although it stressed the importance of reducing that risk further. This opinion was shared by the vast majority of scientists at the time, and was particularly influenced by the fact that scrapie in sheep, a disease with a similar aetiology to BSE, had never been a problem for human health. To Southwood's dismay, his report was used by government without equivocation to persuade people of the near impossibility of human infection. When human infections did occur, and when it was unclear how many people would become infected, Southwood's group was criticized for not warning more strongly of the possible dangers. The episode highlights the great difficulties in providing scientific advice in the face of uncertainty, and the dangers of nuanced scientific arguments being reinterpreted in the political arena. Dick Southwood was a man of immense charm who will be remembered with great fondness, and some awe, by generations of ecologists. He never lost the love of natural history that filled his summer holidays as a schoolboy in Kent, and which informed so much of his scientific research. The handbook for the identification of British Heteroptera that he wrote in 1959 with Dennis Leston,  Land and Water Bugs  of the British Isles, is still the standard work on the group. He was also an inspired teacher, and wrote an influential textbook on ecological methods. Students found his exuberance for science and natural history infectious. Mischievously, when teaching sampling techniques on Imperial College field courses, he would contrive that \u2018randomly\u2019 placed quadrats would include the most interesting plants or insects in the site \u2014 to this day, we teach our students the difference between randomized, stratified and southwoodian sampling!

When it is breathed in, however, it also causes the rarer but deadlier pneumonic plague. The pathology of this disease in humans and animals is fairly well understood, but much less is known about the earliest stages. Wyndham W. Lathem and colleagues ( Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA   102,  17786\u201317791; 2005) have developed a mouse model of pneumonic plague that gives perspectives on these stages as experienced by the host and by the bacterium. The team infected mice with  Y. pestis  through the nose, and the animals developed a disease that closely resembled pneumonic plague in humans. Bacterial numbers in the animals' lungs increased massively in the first 24 hours after infection. Yet when the authors studied the levels of inflammatory molecules normally produced during an immune response, there was little change during this period. So the bacteria must have a potent anti-inflammatory activity that allows them to become established before the host immune system detects them. After 48 hours, the levels of inflammatory molecules escalated, showing that the mouse immune response does eventually kick in; but it would seem to be too little, too late. And what happens in  Y. pestis ? A microarray analysis showed that there is a change in the expression of about 10% of the bacterium's genes after it infects its host. Notably, many of these genes are associated with virulence, and in particular with the so-called type III secretion system. This system was already known as a potential means for the bacterium to subvert its host's immune system by altering the types and amounts of inflammatory molecules. That the expression of genes for the system is increased in the mice confirms this animal model as biologically valid. Moreover, a comparison with  in vitro  studies showed that the regulation of this system is more complex  in vivo  \u2014 suggesting that the model will provide greater insight into this devastating infection.

Comparison of the genomes sheds light on, among other things, what endows them with pathogenic or beneficial features. The genome sequences of three  Aspergillus  fungi are reported in this issue:  Aspergillus oryzae 1 , used in making the Japanese drink sake; the human pathogen  Aspergillus fumigatus 2 ; and the genetic model species  Aspergillus nidulans 3 . The 185 known species of  Aspergillus  include 20 human pathogens, numerous plant pathogens and a variety of species that we use to produce foods, chemicals and industrial enzymes. The genomes provide a wealth of information about the evolution of this fascinating group of organisms, and about the beneficial or detrimental characteristics of each species. The sequences, published by teams from Japan, the United States and Europe, cover an average of nearly 95% of each genome. In total across the three species, more than 95 megabases have been sequenced, crammed with over 33,500 protein-coding genes contained on 24 chromosomes (eight chromosomes per species). By comparison, the human genome has about 30,000 protein-coding genes in 3,000 megabases. Aspergillus oryzae  has been used for nearly a thousand years to produce traditional Japanese fermented foods and drinks. Its genome 1  has about seven to nine megabases more DNA than  A. fumigatus  and  A. nidulans . To account for this, the authors propose that some genes were transferred to  A. oryzae  from other species during evolution. The extra DNA stretches are dispersed throughout the genome and are enriched in genes involved in the synthesis and the transport of numerous secondary metabolites \u2014 the chemical compounds in an organism that are not directly involved in normal growth, development or reproduction. Secondary metabolites are often specific to one or a few species, so they provide a window on the particular biology of the species. Species closely related to  A. oryzae , such as  Aspergillus flavus  and  Aspergillus niger , have similar gene acquisitions. For instance, the toxic  A. flavus  has 25 genes encoding proteins involved in the pathway that produces the poisonous \u2018aflatoxin\u2019. These genes are present in  A. oryzae  but are not expressed. It is likely that an ancestor of  A. flavus  passed these genes to  A. oryzae , and that they were then inactivated during the subsequent evolution of  A. oryzae . Aspergillus fumigatus  is a potentially deadly human pathogen and a major allergen. The  A. fumigatus  sequence 2  pinpoints nine previously unknown allergens, numerous genes involved in the production of specific secondary metabolites, and a set of essential genes that may be potential targets for drugs. However, the factors that underlie the pathogenicity of this species are complex, and their identification required other approaches to complement the genome analysis. For instance, for  A. fumigatus  to thrive inside warm-blooded creatures such as ourselves, it must be able to tolerate our high body temperature (compared with that of the external environment). Using DNA microarray analysis, a set of \u2018thermotolerance genes\u2019 whose activity increases at 37 \u00b0C has been identified. But it seems that warming up to 37 \u00b0C is insufficient to turn on many genes that are associated with virulence in this species. Aspergillus nidulans  has long been a model organism used to study the genetics of fungi. Its genome 3  was crucial for the comparative analysis of the three aspergilli, but it also had some features of its own to reveal. For instance, the regulation of several of its genes was clarified, with the identification of putative binding sites for gene regulatory factors and control elements, as well as many short open reading frames that lie upstream of genes; these short sequences may stall the expression of neighbouring genes. In addition, the sequence disclosed many previously unknown genes involved in peculiar metabolic (fatty-acid oxidation), developmental (polarized growth) and DNA-repair pathways. The three species diverged several hundred million years ago, and their genomes differ considerably 3 . There are almost 3,000 proteins that are closely related, or \u2018homologous\u2019, among the genomes. On average, these proteins have only 68% of their constituent amino acids present in all three genomes \u2014 a value comparable to that of proteins homologous between mammals and fish, which diverged around 450 million years ago. Nevertheless, the order of the homologous proteins along chromosomes (synteny) is conserved in the three species, indicating that no whole-genome duplication occurred during evolution. However, large regions lack any synteny because of small tandem repeats, gene rearrangements in the chromosome extremities, and considerable random breakage and rearrangements of syntenic blocks. Such genome reorganization is seen to a greater extent in  A. oryzae  than in  A. fumigatus . The rates of amino-acid evolution within homologous genes are similar for all three species, so the evolution of large structural rearrangements does not parallel the rate of individual amino-acid changes. The chief revelation from the three-genome comparison is the mating systems in  A. fumigatus  and  A. oryzae . Sexual reproduction in yeast can take place only between individuals of opposite mating type, or \u2018sex\u2019, as determined by mating-type genes.  Aspergillus nidulans  has two mating-type genes: one contains an alpha box and the other a high-mobility-group (HMG) domain. So each cell can have two sexes at once, and  A. nidulans  is self-fertile.  Aspergillus nidulans  can also reproduce asexually by \u2018mitotic reproduction\u2019, creating spores that are sprinkled by structures known as conidiophores. Aspergillus fumigatus  and  A. oryzae  were believed to reproduce only through the asexual mitotic process. Unexpectedly, however, the  A. oryzae  and  A. fumigatus  genomes each have a mating-type gene: the  A. oryzae  sequence contains an alpha mating-type gene, whereas the  A. fumigatus  sequence has an HMG mating-type gene. These genes occupy nearly identical positions in their respective genomes, with conserved synteny for 1.7 megabases on either side. In addition, 215 genes implicated in different phases of the  A. nidulans  mating process occur in  A. oryzae  and  A. fumigatus . These and other recent data 4  raise the possibility that  A. fumigatus  and  A. oryzae  are heterosexual, and that conversion of bisexuality to heterosexuality occurred during the evolution of the  Aspergillus  genus ( Fig. 1 ). These reports describe only the initial examination of the genomes, of course, and the sequences provide much scope for further analyses. The sequencing of other  Aspergillus  genomes is under way and will provide an even broader perspective on the biology and evolution of these fungi. The most keenly anticipated  Aspergillus  sequence is that of  A. niger , which has long been used in the industrial production of citric acid 5 . The commercial significance of several  Aspergillus  species has meant that their genome sequences, including that of  A. niger , have been kept behind the closed doors of biotechnology companies for some time. However, this practice seems to be changing: a consortium of Japanese companies has agreed to release its  A. oryzae  sequence, and Monsanto provided access to its  A. nidulans  genome sequence, so that they could be added to the publicly funded sequences now published. And, fortunately, the US Department of Energy has undertaken to complete one of the industrial  A. niger  sequences (which is currently of low coverage) to make public a useful version of this genome. Perhaps the time when genome sequences belong exclusively to industry is over. Reprints and Permissions"},

Curl"}], "parsed_as_year": "2006_or_before", "body": "Chemist and champion of nanotechnology. Towards the end of his life, Richard Smalley had begun to say, \u201cIf it ain't tubes, we don't do it\u201d. He had become fascinated by the prospect that fullerenes \u2014 the massive carbon molecules with distinctive geometrical shapes that he had co-discovered in 1985 \u2014 might be re-formed into single-walled nanotubes with exciting properties. In particular, he dreamt of making a metallically conducting cable of billions of these carbon nanotubes, which, for the same weight, would be many times stronger than steel. Smalley's time ran out before he achieved that goal; nevertheless, the legacy of this research already extends far beyond the confines of materials science, to such diverse fields as energy technology and medicine. The single-minded obsession that Smalley, who died on 28 October, brought to nanotube research was in fact rather out of character. In his early career as an independent researcher, he had tended to create a new research field about every two years, often abandoning them with equal frequency. The tenor of this period was set in postdoctoral work at the University of Chicago, where he pioneered a technique that combined laser excitation of molecules with their cooling by supersonic jets of gas. He demonstrated that the method greatly simplified the complex spectra of the molecules' energy levels, and allowed complexes bound together by very weak van der Waals interactions to be created and observed. On arriving, in 1976, at Rice University in Houston, Texas \u2014 where he was to stay for the rest of his career \u2014 he rapidly created a series of spectroscopic tools based on this technique that are used to this day. Smalley's approach was to conceive a way to investigate a chemical system or phenomenon, construct the necessary sophisticated apparatus, do enough work to show the true potential of the method, and move on. Each new project was better than the last, offering further valuable scientific information. The discovery of the fullerenes, which led to his Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1996, grew out of one such project. In this, Smalley was studying jet-cooled molecular clusters formed by the condensation of laser-vaporized metals or semiconductors. In March 1984, the British chemist Harry Kroto, whose radio astronomy observations had detected long carbon-chain compounds in interstellar clouds, visited Rice. Kroto saw the vaporizing graphite in Smalley's apparatus as a way of testing his idea that these chains were being formed by the condensation of species ejected from carbon-rich stars. When the experiments were finally performed at the facility in September 1985, proof for the formation of carbon chains between 7 and 12 atoms long, the size range of the astronomical observations, was indeed found. The experiments also showed striking evidence that more interesting, much larger carbon clusters of between 40 and 80 atoms were being formed simultaneously. The particularly high abundance of the C 60  cluster could only be explained if it were a stable, closed cage with 20 hexagonal and 12 pentagonal interlocking faces, rather like a football, or soccer ball. Because of the transatlantic conflict between the experimentalists over the exact name of the ball and the sport it belonged to \u2014 and because the structure was reminiscent of the geodesic domes of the architect Buckminster Fuller \u2014 the C 60  structure was named buckminsterfullerene. A more general examination of the number of carbon atoms in the other, differently sized clusters that were found led to the gradual realization that they must all be carbon cages consisting of exactly 12 pentagons and a number of hexagons that grew with increasing cluster size. Efforts in Smalley's laboratory to make a macroscopic sample of buckminsterfullerene were abandoned fairly quickly after experiments to vaporize a graphite rod using a laser left no trace of C 60 . The isolation in 1990 of a mixture of C 60  and C 70 , using an apparatus consisting of a carbon arc inside a bell jar, seemed ridiculously simple compared with Smalley's high-tech approach. Smalley reinvestigated the laser vaporization technique, and found that the amount of C 60  produced depended strongly on the temperature of the wall of the quartz tube that surrounded the graphite rod: no C 60  was obtained when it was at room temperature, but there was a 20% yield at 1,100 \u00b0C. The isolation of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs), announced in June 1993, soon drove Smalley's attention and considerable powers to another domain. The development of synthesis techniques for SWNTs was a challenge unlike anything Smalley had encountered before 1990, and virtually all that was known was the need for a metal catalyst \u2014 iron, cobalt or nickel. Soon Smalley found that, by impregnating these metals into the graphite rods used to make C 60  in the laser vaporization experiments, he could create SWNTs in the form of ropes containing more than a hundred individual tubes. Between 1993 and 2005, Smalley found a generally better way of making the tubes, as well as ways of cutting them up, performing chemical reactions on them and producing them in solution. In the last week of his life, desperately ill with leukaemia, he was enthusiastically receiving progress reports in his hospital bed and suggesting new ideas and experiments. Rick Smalley was a remarkable person, both professionally and personally. He had two sons almost thirty years different in age, and four wives \u2014 the first two of whom were his guests at the Nobel ceremony in 1996 (when he himself was single). Everyone got along amiably, both former wives seeming to have a wonderful time. As his end neared, Smalley's fourth wife Deborah and older son Chad cared for him constantly. Smalley's ability to vacuum up information, organize it and use it for creative scientific endeavour was prodigious. He always tackled the most challenging problems, was indefatigable in the pursuit of answers, and in all arguments met logic with logic. Smalley had a whimsical sense of humour and tremendous personal charisma. Others usually found it to their advantage to follow his lead, as collaboration with Smalley generally resulted in excellent scientific results. Smalley's persuasiveness came most effectively to bear in the campaign to convince the US government to create its National Nanotechnology Initiative, a great achievement in public policy.

But a technique that uses chaotically varying signals to transmit information more privately may help it shed that bad-boy image. Synchronization leads to communication \u2014 even when the signals used are chaotic. That is the lesson of a study by Argyris and colleagues on  page 343  of this issue 1 . It reports the successful transfer of digital information at gigabit rates by chaotically fluctuating laser light travelling through more than 100 kilometres of a commercial fibre-optic link around Athens, Greece ( Fig. 1 ). The transmitter and receiver become harmonized in chaotic synchrony, allowing information to be reliably extracted at the other end \u2014 a result that brings us closer to exploiting the inherent advantages of chaos, rather than trying to eliminate it whenever it appears. The phenomenon of synchronization in periodic systems has been known since at least 1665, when Christiaan Huygens observed that pendulum clocks become synchronized when placed close to each other on a common support. Asian fireflies flashing together, flocks of geese flying in remarkable formations and pedestrians in lock-step on London's Millennium Bridge are illustrations of synchronization when large numbers of living creatures get together 2 . But synchrony also arises in inert matter: lasers and masers both exploit the ability of large ensembles of atoms and molecules to harmonize their oscillations and emit light in coherence. The key to synchrony in such systems is that the individual elements are in some way coupled to each other, leading to the formation of \u2014 sometimes beautiful \u2014 patterns in space and time. So can synchrony be observed in systems that behave chaotically? One of the hallmarks of chaotic systems that are isolated from one another is that their evolution diverges exponentially fast, even when their initial conditions are very similar. This is why predicting the weather more than a few days in advance is so hard. Therefore, the finding a couple of decades ago that suitably coupled chaotic systems could (under certain conditions) do exactly the opposite, and converge from distant initial conditions to synchronize their chaotic motions, came as a huge surprise 3 , 4 . The subsequent discovery that lasers can emit light in patterns that are chaotic in time and space clearly implied that remote lasers should be able to synchronize if they receive light from one another, whether through space or through an optical fibre. Experiments soon confirmed this, and with the exchange of only small amounts of light, too 5 , 6 . The synchronization is sufficiently robust for information to be exchanged: if one of the chaotic laser systems, the transmitter, is perturbed by a message source, it can \u2018fold\u2019 that information into its own chaotic waveform, which it transmits to the input of the second laser system, the receiver. Meanwhile, the receiver's output is a synchronized replica of the transmitter's original, unperturbed chaotic waveform \u2014 so the receiver recovers the message as the difference between its input and output waveforms. (Analogously, a radio receiver that is tuned to a carrier frequency recovers information from perturbations of the amplitude or frequency of a periodic waveform.) Argyris and colleagues 1  take a large stride towards showing that the method of transmitting and receiving information using chaotic waveforms can also work in the real world, without the stable conditions of the laboratory. Applying chaotic systems in real-world communications is a beguiling prospect, because a third party intercepting the signal would have difficulty extracting the information sent. Such security aspects of chaos-based communications admittedly need much further analysis. But as the authors point out, chaotic carrier waveforms offer privacy in a manner that could be complementary to and compatible with conventional software-based and quantum-cryptographic systems. The remarkable features of the authors' work are the simplicity of their set-up \u2014 they use chaotic diode laser systems and instrumentation that are widely available off the peg \u2014 and their demonstration that information can be recovered with quite reasonable bit-error rates over a commercial fibre-optic link. The optical fibre used for the experiments in Athens was temporarily free of network traffic, but was still installed and connected to the switches of the network nodes. The authors measured the characteristics of the fibre, such as its attenuation and chromatic dispersion, before the experiment. This allowed them, for example, to exactly counter the effects of dispersion by inserting an appropriate length of dispersion-compensating fibre at the beginning of the link. Three amplifiers were used, one at the transmitter, one 50 kilometres from the transmitter, and one at the receiver, followed by optical filters with bandwidths of around 1 nanometre \u2014 this respectively compensated for optical losses and removed spontaneous noise. The scheme used by Argyris  et al . exploited time-delayed feedback to generate high-dimensional, high-capacity chaotic waveforms at high bandwidths. This has turned out to be a most fruitful approach: the bit-rate limit of several gigabits in these experiments is set by the electronic and optical components used, and could become much higher with suitably designed systems. For instance, the authors' strategy is compatible with a technique known as wavelength multiplexing; this allows much higher bit rates to pass through a single fibre by transmitting light of many different wavelengths simultaneously. The exciting possibilities revealed by these experiments 1  may be pursued in other directions that more fully exploit the possibilities available for communication using electromagnetic waves. The vector properties of light waves (their polarization) could be used to encode data 7 . Optical patterns that are chaotic in time and space might also be used to communicate holographic information 8  by generalized synchronization. Here, transmitter and receiver do not share identical synchronized dynamics; instead, the relationship between the two is given by a mathematical function, supplying an additional element of privacy. The success of such developments will ultimately depend on our willingness to implement new ways of transporting optical signals, as well as on novel transmitters and receivers. The rewards could be considerable, not only in understanding the communication of information using chaotic physical systems. Such work could in the long term also help us to elucidate the workings of that most private of communication networks \u2014 the human brain. Reprints and Permissions"},

Stylophorans, which were just centimetres in length, bear little resemblance to any extant animal and have defied categorization for decades. S\u00e9bastien Clausen and Andrew B. Smith, in a report elsewhere in this issue ( Nature   438 , 351\u2013354; 2005), claim to have broken the deadlock. They have identified a single feature which, they argue, rules out two of three hypotheses about the biology of stylophorans. Figure 1 of their paper ( page 351 ) offers a quick guide to the hypotheses under test. The body of  Ceratocystis  is divided into a large, irregular-plated blob at one end; a long, thin, segmented section at the other (apparently constructed as a column of discs); and a connecting region that looks like bellows run over by a lawnmower. The only feature on which all authorities agree concerns the various plates: they look exactly like the calcitic plates of echinoderms, a large group of marine organisms that today includes starfishes, sea urchins and the like. This assignment has given rise to the three hypotheses. The most enduring is that the long segmented section and the connecting region comprise a mobile stem. Many fossil echinoderms, and some extant ones \u2014 the crinoids \u2014 have similar appendages. According to this view, stylophorans are very primitive echinoderms that evolved before the appearance of other echinoderm features, such as the distinctive water-vascular system manifested as arrays of canals ending in avenues of \u2018tube-feet\u2019. In one of the alternative hypotheses, stylophorans are held to be highly evolved echinoderms in which the stalk is a feeding arm, with a mouth somewhere in the middle linked to tube-feet that are covered by retractable plates. In the other hypothesis, they are interpreted as primitive chordates that retain a calcite skeleton from a more remote common ancestor of echinoderms and chordates, and the stalk contains muscle blocks, a notochord and a brain. Clausen and Smith tackle the job of inferring the soft parts of  Ceratocystis  by studying the microstructure of the calcite plates. The mid-stalk region of the creature bears one large ossicle known as the stylocone, and the surface structure of the calcite (replaced by iron oxides in the specimens studied) has textures that, by analogy with modern echinoderms, give an indication of the kind of tissue to which the stylocone was adjacent in life. It seems that the part of the stylocone adjoining the long segmented section faced connective tissue, as is now seen in modern stalked echinoderms such as crinoids. In contrast, the part of the stylocone next to the bellows region shows a surface similar to those that in echinoderms act as attachment sites for muscle. There are no signs of anything like a mouth or tube-feet as implied by the feeding-arm model, and the plates in the stalk do not seem to have been hinged to allow exposure of tube-feet. The chordate hypothesis is also ruled out, as the muscle would have inserted directly into the calcite, rather than being bound up in discrete, chordate-style muscle blocks. The conclusion, then, is that  Ceratocystis  used its appendage as a muscular, locomotory organ. So its anatomy (and its evolutionary position) conforms to the oldest and least demanding of the three hypotheses. Reprints and Permissions"},

Close examination confirms the interplay of conduction electrons and lattice vibrations that contributes to this effect. Certain manganese oxides (manganites) exhibit an intriguing effect known as \u2018colossal magnetoresistance\u2019. Below a certain critical temperature, these materials become ferromagnetic \u2014 showing the spontaneous alignment of electron spins that accounts for the magnetic attraction of materials such as iron \u2014 and this is accompanied by a drastic reduction in electrical resistance. On  page 474  of this issue, Mannella and colleagues 1  describe the electronic properties of a two-layer manganite compound, La 1.2 Sr 1.8 Mn 2 O 7  (LSMO), revealing that the interaction of electrons and lattice vibrations known as phonons is crucial to colossal magnetoresistance. The results also bring to light unexpected similarities between the electronic structures of manganites and superconducting copper oxides. In a metallic material such as a manganite, electrons fill quantum-mechanically allowed energy states singly from the lowest possible energy upwards. (This is a consequence of the Pauli exclusion principle, which holds that no two electrons may share the same quantum state.) The energy of the most highly occupied state is known as the chemical potential, or Fermi energy. The electronic energy states in a solid with a periodic lattice structure also have a well-defined momentum; when components of these momenta in the three spatial dimensions are plotted against each other, the occupied states form a characteristic shape bounded by a so-called Fermi surface. Only electrons in states near the Fermi surface \u2014 those with the highest momenta \u2014 contribute to conduction. According to a central tenet of quantum mechanics, known as Heisenberg's uncertainty relation, how sharply defined these energy states are is a measure of the degree to which electrons scatter on the lattice or on each other. So a good metal, with a low electrical resistance (little scattering), will have a sharply delineated Fermi surface. Mannella and colleagues 1  provide the first experimental observation of the Fermi surface in a manganite. The technique they use, photoemission spectroscopy, is based on the photoelectric effect, in which light striking a metallic surface behaves as if it were a particle, knocking out a loosely bound electron. The electron's momentum and energy can be probed directly using this method, and the photoelectric effect has been a workhorse of experimental condensed-matter physics since it was first explained by Albert Einstein 100 years ago (for which he won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921). The authors show that the Fermi surface of LSMO becomes more sharply defined when the material is cooled into the ferromagnetic state, indicating that its resistance has fallen. The result fits in with our understanding of colossal magnetoresistance as the suppression, induced by the onset of ferromagnetic order, of an interaction between electrons and phonons (the quanta of lattice vibrations) 2  that increases resistance. This bundling of electron and lattice properties can itself be treated as a physical entity moving through the lattice \u2014 a \u2018quasiparticle\u2019 known as a polaron. Scanning tunnelling microscopy measurements of LSMO support this picture 3 , showing images of polarons trapped by occasional impurities. Mannella and colleagues' results also indicate that the spectral weight of the sample (loosely, the proportion of the total number of energy states that exist at the Fermi surface) is very small, explaining why these states have not been observed previously. In addition, the measured energy spectrum at the Fermi surface is not isotropic, but depends strongly on the direction: electrons propagate readily (albeit with a velocity five times smaller than expected) in a direction that is diagonal to the square lattice of manganese atoms, but poorly along the axes of the lattice. The reduced spectral weight and velocity seem to imply that, even in the metallic state, in which conduction electrons supposedly move freely throughout the lattice, electrons and phonons are interdependent. The results are puzzling, because at low temperatures manganites such as LSMO are good metals with an isotropic conductivity. The shape of the Fermi surface itself \u2014 with large parts that are nearly parallel, or \u2018nested\u2019 \u2014 supplies one possible interpretation. Nesting provides a channel through which an electron can be scattered between different parts of the Fermi surface; in this case it is scattered by a phonon, but in general it could also be scattered by magnetic fluctuations, should these exist. Scattering would reduce the electronic spectral weight around the Fermi energy and induce a gap in the energy spectrum. The spectrum measured by Mannella  et al . is very similar to that of the mysterious \u2018pseudogap\u2019 phase seen in high-temperature cuprate superconductors. This intriguing fact suggests that such a gap is a generic feature of the oxides of transition metals \u2014 rather than being a facet only of cuprate superconductors, as had been assumed. A further widespread belief is that phonons play no role in the high-temperature superconductivity seen in cuprates, despite the fact that interactions between electrons and phonons underlie conventional, low-temperature superconductivity. But it has been shown 4 , 5 , 6  that phonons affect various properties of the electrons in these superconductors, especially in the pseudogap phase. Mannella  et al . 1  provide yet another incentive to examine the role of phonons more carefully. Reprints and Permissions"},

So physicists have recently begun to exploit structures known as photonic crystals to try to extract more light. But while they have been trying to forge the most efficient devices, it now turns out that the swallowtail butterfly has already mastered the art of emitting light. The eye-catching  Papilio nireus  butterfly from eastern and central Asia has wings emblazoned with iridescent blue-green patches (pictured). Pete Vukusic and Ian Hooper have used electron microscopy to learn more about the optical properties of these spots ( Science   310 , 1151; 2005). Their images reveal that the scales on the butterfly's wings contain an intricate nanostructure of all-natural photonic crystals. The crystals are just one part of a sophisticated photonic system that provides intense, directed light and endows the butterfly with its striking colours. A two-dimensional photonic crystal \u2018slab\u2019, about two micrometres thick, is set within the solid outer wing layer, and consists of hollow cylinders arranged in triangular domains. Highly fluorescent pigment, whose peak excitation wavelength matches that of the blue of the sky, is infused throughout the slab. And layered structures, known as Bragg reflectors, sit about 1.5 micrometres below the crystals. Photonic crystals can stop light of specific frequencies from propagating within them. In this way, they can be used to limit or inhibit the emission of an optical emitter that is embedded deep within the crystal. The optical properties of the crystals in this butterfly's scales are such that emission from the fluorescent dye is inhibited only within the crystal plane. Added to the effects of the underlying Bragg reflectors, this means the fluorescent light has nowhere to go but up and out. The effect is clearly seen in the optical-microscope image of a single scale (inset). Notably, similar techniques are used in the latest ultra-efficient LEDs. An astonishing variety of natural photonic structures are being uncovered not just in butterflies, but also in other insects, birds and fish. Although nature and technology have evolved independently, they have ultimately come up with the same design. Reprints and Permissions"},

May"}], "parsed_as_year": "2006_or_before", "body": "Analyses of contact-tracing data on the spread of infectious disease, combined with mathematical models, show that control measures require better knowledge of variability in individual infectiousness. The SARS epidemic was notable for the existence of \u2018superspreaders\u2019 who infected dozens of people, whereas other infectious individuals infected few or none. Were SARS superspreaders anomalies, or are superspreaders characteristic of most infectious diseases? What effects does heterogeneity in infectiousness have on disease emergence and control? On  page 355  of this issue, Lloyd-Smith  et al . 1  provide insight into such questions, and more. The first question any ecologist asks about an invasive species is: what is the invader's intrinsic capacity for population increase? To answer this, the species' basic reproductive number,  R 0 , is measured by the average number of offspring per capita that survive to reproductive age. For a directly transmitted infectious disease, be it polio, smallpox, SARS, HIV/AIDS or some newly emerging pathogen,  R 0  is the average number of infections produced by an infected individual in a susceptible population 2 . If  R 0  is less than one, a self-sustaining epidemic is not possible (at least without further pathogen evolution). If  R 0  exceeds one, then although early stochastic fluctuations may extinguish the invader, an epidemic is possible. If  R 0  is large, an epidemic is virtually certain. Initial work in this area largely treated individuals in populations as having an equal chance of transmitting disease \u2014 that is, as being homogeneous \u2014 and ignored stochastic fluctuations in transmission capability. However, studies of gonorrhoea 3 , and of HIV/AIDS 4 , could not explain epidemiological patterns without acknowledging heterogeneities in patterns of sexual-partner acquisition, including the disproportionate influence of superspreaders. Similarly, knowledge of heterogeneous parasite burdens is fundamental to accurate modelling of helminthic diseases 5 , 6 . Explanations of epidemiological patterns of malaria also depend on understanding heterogeneous biting by the mosquito vector 7 . These observations led to the proposal of the 20/80 rule 2 , 8 , which suggests that roughly 20% of the most infectious individuals are responsible for 80% of the transmission ( Fig. 1 , overleaf). This rule has been applied mainly to helminthic and sexually transmitted diseases 7 ; for other directly transmitted diseases, such as smallpox or influenza, heterogeneity in infectiousness has been neglected. The superspreading that seemed to fuel the 2003 SARS epidemic was largely treated as anomalous in most models, but it highlighted the need for a reassessment of heterogeneous infectiousness 9 . Lloyd-Smith  et al . 1  address this point by posing infectiousness as a continuous variable, and formulate an unambiguous and universally applicable definition of superspreaders as those who transmit more infection than is predicted by a homogeneous \u2018null model\u2019. The authors analyse data from eight human infections, including SARS, measles, smallpox, monkeypox and pneumonic plague, to show that superspreading occurs across the board, although to a greater or lesser extent depending on the disease. Heterogeneity is greatest for SARS and least for Ebola haemorrhagic fever. Analysis of the epidemiological dynamics shows that, for a given  R 0 , both the probability that an epidemic will take off, and the subsequent course of the epidemic, are affected by such heterogeneity. These results may be appreciated intuitively. For a given value of  R 0 , high heterogeneity in infectiousness implies that relatively few individuals are responsible for most of the transmission \u2014 or conversely, that many individuals do not transmit at all. In turn, such small numbers tend to generate pronounced stochastic fluctuations in the initial stages of the epidemic. Consequently, a heterogeneously infectious emerging disease will be less likely to generate an epidemic, but if sustained, the resulting epidemic is more likely to be explosive. Thus, it is dangerous to underestimate a disease on the basis of frequent \u2018failed\u2019 attempts, as exemplified by bird flu. The authors highlight the practical implications of their work. Control efforts should aim to identify the highly infectious superspreaders, and target vaccination or other interventions at them. In this way, the outbreak may be halted sooner, and with fewer people treated, than if efforts are directed at random individuals. Furthermore, Lloyd-Smith  et al . distinguish between individual-specific and population-wide control measures (for example isolating individual patients as opposed to advising an entire population to reduce the behaviours associated with transmission). They show that individual-specific strategies are more likely to exterminate an emerging disease than population-wide interventions, because the former increase heterogeneity in infectiousness. Comparisons can be drawn between these new findings 1  and work on heterogeneities in contact patterns among individuals (for example in SARS 10 , or sexually transmitted diseases such as HIV/AIDS 4 ) and among groups (foot-and-mouth disease, for instance 11 ). Earlier research on contact patterns led to a generalized theorem (ref.  2 ; equation 12.23), which was based on the following reasoning. We can estimate the proportion,  p * , to be vaccinated or otherwise treated in order to eradicate infection in a homogeneous population ( p * =1\u22121/R 0 ). However, if we take advantage of the heterogeneity, and target the more infectious or more sexually active individuals (depending on the disease), then we can achieve our aim by treating a smaller proportion than is estimated by  p * , as echoed in the results of Lloyd-Smith and colleagues. This general result, first discovered in the epidemiological literature in the mid-1980s, also applies to the structure of information-technology networks in relation to targeted versus random \u2018viral\u2019 attacks 12 . There are also differences between the work of Lloyd-Smith  et al . and work on heterogeneities in contact patterns. Given that contact rates govern the likelihood both of becoming infected and of passing on infection, models based on heterogeneous contact rates have assumed perfect correlation between infectiousness and susceptibility. Consider HIV/AIDS, where in the simplest case  R 0 = \u03b2Dc , with  \u03b2  being the transmission probability (a measure of the infectiousness of an infected individual),  D  the duration of the infectiousness, and  c  the average rate at which new sexual partners are acquired. Heterogeneities among individuals with respect to  \u03b2  or in  D  do not directly affect  R 0  as such: the quantities  \u03b2  and  D  enter the dynamic equations linearly, and the appropriate values for estimating  R 0  are just the simple averages. By contrast, the distribution of partner-acquisition rates enters nonlinearly; those with more partners are more likely to acquire infection by virtue of their higher activity, and they are also more likely to transmit infection. Consequently, the epidemiologically appropriate \u2018average partner-acquisition rate\u2019,  c , is not the mean of the distribution, but rather the mean-square divided by the mean. An incorrect result is obtained for  R 0  when the average of the partner-acquisition or contact distribution is used. (This observation, incidentally, helps explain how large geographical variation in HIV incidence can arise from differences in the tails of such distributions.) In contrast, Lloyd-Smith  et al . evaluate heterogeneity in overall  R 0  (integrating all contributing factors), and assume that infectiousness is not correlated with susceptibility. As they note, the reality probably lies somewhere in between, with some intermediate level of correlation between infectiousness and susceptibility. Although there is a considerable advantage in targeted control measures if highly infectious individuals can be identified before they have transmitted infection 1 , 8 , this is easier said than done. In the case of sexually transmitted diseases and contact patterns, however, Cohen  et al . 13  formulated a seemingly paradoxical method for achieving this aim, without directly identifying the active individuals. This procedure is based on the realization that one's contacts will on average be more highly connected within a contact network than oneself, simply by virtue of being a contact. Thus, highly connected individuals can be identified for intervention by first picking individuals at random, and then selecting randomly among their acquaintances. In this way, highly connected individuals are identified with minimal effort. Moreover, this procedure can be carried out either before or after an outbreak. Among the next steps to be taken are further parametrization of heterogeneity for different diseases and for the same disease in different settings, and determination of the characteristics of emerging diseases that are likely to exhibit the most pronounced heterogeneity. Heterogeneous infectiousness, and its extreme manifestation of superspreading, are likely to be general properties of disease transmission in populations. The ambitious aim of controlling disease emergence will require a better understanding of those properties, which is most likely to be achieved through the combination of data analysis and epidemiological theory exemplified by Lloyd-Smith and colleagues' study.

Could this be similar to an ancestral catalyst that existed billions of years ago? The title of this piece evokes the capture of exotic beasts for zoos, and hints at the reanimation of the extinct. Both goals apply to the work of Fusz  et al . 1 , who, as they report in  Chemistry and Biology , went hunting for a sort of molecule that might have existed about 4 billion years ago. According to the \u2018RNA world\u2019 hypothesis, life at this time consisted of macro-molecular or cellular assemblies, with RNA molecules rather than proteins catalysing chemical reactions. In support of this, a number of RNA enzymes (ribozymes) have been created, or captured from the wild, that can carry out the sorts of chemical reaction \u2014 the formation of peptide bonds, for example \u2014 that would have been necessary for such life. Now Fusz  et al . identify a ribozyme that can catalyse the particularly tricky aldol reaction. This involves carbon\u2013carbon bond formation which would have been required at several significant points in the evolution of life, including, possibly, when ribose was first produced. Fusz and colleagues' success at finding a ribozyme that could catalyse the aldol reaction ( Fig. 1 ) makes it more likely that the \u2018organisms\u2019 in the RNA world actually used aldol reactions 2 . The authors used selection\u2013amplification, or SELEX 3 , to track down their prey. This technique sifts through a quadrillion or so random sequences of RNA to find a few (or perhaps just one) that can carry out a specified reaction. This may seem like looking for a needle in a haystack, but SELEX is extremely powerful: it has turned up more RNA catalysts than have been found by harvesting from living material 4 . Aldol chemistry occurs in a crucial step in sugar metabolism in all cells, and is central to glycolysis, the Calvin cycle, and other energy-yielding pathways. As only the second reaction forming a carbon\u2013carbon bond found to be carried out by RNA 5 , 6 , aldol reactions are also a welcome addition to RNA catalytic diversity. In nature, novel activities would probably arise from the adaptation of existing molecules that already had some of the required properties. By contrast, SELEX usually involves a single search of a set of randomized sequences. The number of sequences expands exponentially with the size of the molecule found \u2014 ten times for each 1.6 nucleotides added 7 . It is much easier for a novel activity to evolve in nature, through the selection of subtle enhancements of an existing molecule, than for us to happen upon an entirely new activity all at once by finding a sequence of 15\u201320 nucleotides. Thus, when single-step selection succeeds, it strongly implies that the active site could also have been found by ribocytes, the supposed primordial RNA \u2018cells\u2019, using a more effective evolutionary search. Fusz  et al . ensured that the desired aldol catalyst would announce itself by coaxing the aldol reaction to link a tag to the active RNA. The tag then aided the physical separation of the RNA from the substrate so that the RNA could be studied in isolation. The result of their search was a ribozyme that could carry out an aldol reaction about 4,300-fold faster than the reaction would occur in solution. This catalyst was difficult to find: there was only one sequence that could carry out the reaction efficiently among the 10 15  starting RNAs. This unique large RNA had a major nucleotide tract that could be deleted without affecting the aldol reaction ( Fig. 1 ). This is to be expected given the single-pass nature of the experiment \u2014 had an aldol ribozyme evolved naturally, this \u2018junk\u2019 would probably have been whittled away by the selection. The new ribozyme absolutely requires zinc ions, which are also uniquely sufficient for the RNA's activity (magnesium, barium, copper, manganese and many other metals will not, on their own, activate ribozymes). This is notable because, of the two common types of protein enzyme that carry out aldol reactions in modern cells, one uses zinc as a catalytic element. So the RNA found by Fusz  et al . may resemble an existing protein in the way it polarizes its reactants to speed up the aldol reaction. Finding an aldol ribozyme is provocative because an RNA world would have required some form of energy metabolism; energy must be captured to maintain complex and unstable molecules such as RNA. Rudimentary catalysts for the replication 8  of RNA or the synthesis of proteins 9  were isolated some time ago. But very few RNAs, either natural or recently winnowed out by artificial selection, supply clues to how energy might have been harvested in an RNA world. So there is a void even in purely imaginative accounts of the RNA world, which these findings help to fill. The reverse aldol (retroaldol) reaction ( Fig. 1 ) is interesting in this light because although not itself an energy-harvesting reaction, it enhances the energy yield from hexose sugars such as glucose during glycolysis. In today's biology, it is closely coupled to reactions that yield ATP, the energy currency for most cellular work. The new reaction is thus a potentially useful part, if not the heart, of a possible metabolic RNA engine that would eat carbohydrates. Reprints and Permissions"},

Only 60 years ago, smoking was generally regarded as innocuous. Now it is recognized as the main cause of lung cancer, the world's commonest cancer. More than any other person, Richard Doll was responsible for this remarkable transformation in attitude, as well as for the now widely accepted view that much cancer (not just of the lung) is, at least in principle, avoidable. Doll, who died on 24 July 2005 aged 92, was the world's foremost epidemiologist and had a wide influence on the progress of the subject. Doll was born on 28 October 1912, the son of a London general practitioner. He might have pursued his strong interest in mathematics, but at the last moment decided to follow his father into medicine, qualifying at St Thomas' Hospital in 1937. His epidemiological career began after war service, with work on the causes of peptic ulcers that attracted the attention of Tony Bradford Hill. At this time many considered that the marked rise in lung cancer deaths between the two world wars was simply due to improved diagnosis. In 1948, however, Percy Stocks and Ernest Kennaway succeeded in persuading the Medical Research Council (MRC) to investigate the issue. For this, the MRC turned to Hill, who recruited Doll, and together they obtained detailed smoking histories from a large number of patients with and without the disease. In 1950 they reported the findings of this \u2018case-control\u2019 study. The rarity of non-smokers and the relative excess of heavy smokers among the lung-cancer cases, compared with the controls, convinced them that cigarette smoking was \u201ca cause, and an important cause\u201d of the disease. This was not, in fact, the first such study, for earlier in the same year similar findings were reported in the United States by Ernst Wynder and Ewart Graham. Doll and Hill, however, went on to collect details of smoking habits from 40,000 British doctors, and to ascertain the causes of death of those who died. Their earlier findings were confirmed, including the dose\u2013response relationship (the more cigarettes smoked, the greater the lung cancer risk). But this \u2018cohort\u2019 approach was also able to reveal the wide range of other smoking-related diseases; in the recent 50-year follow-up, published with Richard Peto, he showed that one-half of persistent smokers were estimated to die as a result of the habit. The long interval from starting smoking before its major effects on mortality appear was another notable finding. This study has continued and is unique in its regular updating of the smoking habits of participants that has allowed recognition of the (unexpected) benefits of stopping smoking. The strong dose\u2013response relation between lung cancer and cigarette smoking, the high standard of the design and conduct of the study, and the balanced assessment of its findings in many papers \u2014 all of these played a part in making a convincing case about the perils of smoking. In consequence, habits have changed. For example, in Britain the proportion of men who smoke has fallen from 80% a few decades ago to less than 30%. Doll's work went far beyond smoking, however. He was involved in early investigations of the carcinogenic effects of ionizing radiation; in 1957 with Michael Court Brown he followed the fates of 14,000 patients with ankylosing spondylitis who were treated with radiation. This cohort study brought independent confirmation of studies of Japanese A-bomb survivors that radiation could cause leukaemia, and it has been a major source of data on the dose\u2013response relation of radiation and cancer. In another project, British radiologists were investigated because of their repeated exposure to low doses of radiation, the only group with excess cancer being those with long practice in the early twentieth century when high cumulative doses were likely as a result of the relative lack of protective procedures. Later Doll studied many aspects of exposure to low levels of radiation, both ionizing (for example radon and its relationship to lung cancer) and non-ionizing (electromagnetic fields from power lines and childhood leukaemia). Doll was an author of the first compendium of worldwide data on cancer incidence, and was the first to recognize that each cancer that was common in one part of the world was rare in another \u2014 and for reasons that are not primarily genetic, but largely extrinsic. In 1954 with Peter Armitage, long before the relevant advances in molecular biology, he adduced evidence for the multi-stage nature of carcinogenesis. In 1955 he was also the first to show a significant excess of lung cancer among asbestos workers and later, with MartinVessey and others, he studied the side-effects of oral contraceptives. He continued a clinical attachment at the Central Middlesex Hospital until 1969, conducting therapeutic trials on peptic ulcers, including the first demonstration of the efficacy of both liquorice extract and carbenoxelone. In 1969 Doll left the MRC Statistical Research Unit in London (of which he had been director since 1961) to become Regius Professor of Medicine at Oxford, an unexpected appointment that brought added attention to the subject of epidemiology. The range of his epidemiological activities was extraordinarily varied. In his career he published over 500 papers, reputedly without the irritation of writing a single grant application (he was, incidentally, saddened that new government rules will prevent certain harmless but valuable research into public health, like some of his own). Late in life he participated in randomized trials, and meta-analyses of trials, of treatments for breast cancer and vascular disease, as well as in collaborative meta-analyses of risk factors for breast cancer. Doll's approach to his work was exemplary. He examined data with extraordinary detachment, even when surrounded by intense preconceptions. The more closely people worked with him, the more respect they had for him. Highly (but unobtrusively) organized, his concentration, efficiency and memory were formidable \u2014 as was his capacity for work, which was unaffected by long-haul flights or age. He is commemorated in Oxford by Green College, which he established, and by the two research units he helped to found. Both of these are now housed in the new Richard Doll Building.

Now it seems that spin can lag considerably behind charge. The recognition that electrons can transport through a solid not just charge, but also spin (the intrinsic \u2018rotation\u2019 of electrons, which gives rise to their magnetic moment), sowed the now burgeoning field of spintronics. As charge and spin are properties of individual electrons, it is tempting to conclude that both will be transported equally efficiently. But Weber  et al . 1 , writing on  page 1330  of this issue, show that the diffusion of electron spin can be substantially slower than that of electron charge. This could have important implications for spin-based electronics. The ability to generate, study and use phenomena such as spin injection, spin currents and spin accumulation, in metals as well as semiconductors, has made it imperative to discover how similar \u2014 or different \u2014 spin and charge transport are. In metals, no substantial differences have been observed 2 ; but in semiconductors, experiments in the past decade have already indicated that charge and spin diffusion act differently 3 . The comparison of the two transport mechanisms is simplified by assuming that the electron spin (or its associated magnetic moment) can point only up or down along a specific axis. In conventional charge currents, these spin-up and spin-down electrons move in the same direction. But when, in the absence of a charge current, spin-up electrons move in one direction, and an equal number of spin-down electrons move in the opposite direction, a spin current is established, with magnetic moment effectively being transported in one direction. Usually, electron motion is diffusive: scattering on impurities, lattice defects and lattice vibrations will, after some time, randomize the direction of an electron's movement. The more scattering that takes place, the slower the electron diffusion will be. As this effect applies equally to spin-up and spin-down electrons, the naive expectation is that the effective rates of charge and spin diffusion should be the same. But this neglects the electrostatic repulsion, or Coulomb interaction, that exists between electrons. The Coulomb interaction does not affect the diffusion of charge, as it does not change the total momentum of the electrons. But it does reduce the diffusion rate of spin through scattering between spin-up and spin-down electrons ( Fig. 1 ) \u2014 the effect known as spin Coulomb drag that has now been demonstrated experimentally by Weber and colleagues 1 . Measuring the relevant experimental parameter, the spin diffusion constant  D s , necessitated a clever technique based on a so-called spin grating 4 . The authors first used 1  the interference between two laser beams polarized linearly, but at right angles to each other, to \u2018pump\u2019 their sample \u2014 a crystal of the semiconductor gallium arsenide \u2014 with a very short light pulse. The two beams met in the plane of the semiconductor at an angle, so their relative phase changed linearly along its surface. This induces a periodic variation in spin density \u2014 the spin grating \u2014 in the quantum wells in which the electrons are confined. Here, regions of excess spin-up and excess spin-down electrons alternate with a spatial period  L  that is dependent on the angle of incidence of the two beams. This spin grating decays with time, partially through intrinsic relaxation of the spin, and partially as a result of diffusion between the excess spin-up and spin-down regions (on a typical timescale  T =L 2 / D s , given by the laws of diffusion). The authors then applied a further linearly polarized, \u2018probe\u2019 laser pulse to their crystal. This brought the Faraday effect into play, which dictates that the interaction of a beam of light with a magnetic field \u2014 in this case, that induced by the electron spins \u2014 will bring about a (slight) rotation of the polarization of the reflected beam. The angle of rotation depends on the induced magnetization (and thus the spin density), so the decay of the spin grating can be investigated by varying the delay between the pump and probe pulses. By ascertaining the effective decay time as a function of the spatial period  L , the authors determined the relative importance of diffusion and relaxation, and obtained values for both  D s  and the intrinsic spin relaxation time. They found that the rate of spin diffusion indicated by  D s  was considerably slower than the charge diffusion rates obtained from conventional electronic measurements. In theoretical calculations 5 , 6 , spin Coulomb drag is expressed by a parameter known as the spin-drag transresistivity; this relates the current in each of the spin channels (spin up or spin down) to the effective electric field in the opposite spin channel. The significance of the transresistivity depends on the number of spatial dimensions considered, the strength of the various interactions between the electrons, and the conventional electronic resistivity. If this last quantity is small, as it is in good conductors such as metals, the effect of spin drag will be relatively small 2 . In the two-dimensional system used by Weber  et al . 1 , however, the effect of spin Coulomb drag turns out to be considerable. Reducing further to a one-dimensional system has revealed that spin and charge can even separate 7 , with the two intrinsic electron properties developing their own distinctive transport modes. These findings are bound to stimulate further research. What is already abundantly clear, however, is that spin and charge both move at their own pace. Reprints and Permissions"},

This species, pictured here, is infamously poisonous, with many other mushrooms being toxic to a greater or lesser degree. Thomas N. Sherratt, David M. Wilkinson and Roderick S. Bain have addressed two issues raised by the existence of poisonous mushrooms ( Am. Nat.  doi:10.1086/497399). The first question was what purposes possession of poisons might serve in mushrooms. One possibility is that toxins are simply a metabolic by-product. Another that has been suggested by several authors is that they act as a deterrent to predators, which might otherwise destroy the mushroom before its spores have matured and dispersed. Fungus-loving vertebrates could in particular be highly destructive. An evolutionary principle is that if you as an organism go to the bother of being unpalatable, you might as well signal that fact. Does this apply in mushrooms? To investigate this second issue, Sherratt  et al . turned to data compilation and neural-network analysis. They made use of modern evolutionary trees to judge the incidence of poisonousness in mushrooms, then analysed data sets, culled from field guides, to see whether poisonous species tend to have particular ecological correlates \u2014 whether, for instance, they are more colourful, more aggregated or have a more noticeable odour. Overall odour (and not cap colour) came out as the best predictor of toxicity, a result that was supported by pairwise comparisons of related poisonous and edible forms. Given that many animals forage by night, and that nocturnal mammals tend to have relatively poor colour vision, the authors suspect that odour provides the more effective signal. Sherratt  et al . make plain that their study is correlative only, and that \u2014 for them and others \u2014 this is a work in progress. There is rich scope for further investigation of the hypothesis that poisonous mushrooms use odours as warning signals, and of the likely exceptions. Reprints and Permissions"},

Is this the signature of the first population of stars that formed in the Universe? On  page 45  of this issue, Kashlinsky  et al . 1  present observations that reveal clustering in the distribution of cosmic infrared light over and above that expected from the combined effect of known galaxies. This excess signal could conceivably be light from stars that switched on when the Universe was just a tiny fraction of its present age. The authors do not detect any individual sources, nor can they pinpoint precisely when in cosmic history these signals were produced. Nevertheless, their result is likely to provoke much discussion among cosmologists. Searching for cosmic sources that ignited when the Universe was very young is at the frontier of our current observational capabilities. Deep surveys with space-based telescopes and the larger ground-based telescopes allow us to observe very faint sources that are thought to have originated in early cosmic times. Much progress has been made in tracing how early stellar systems changed and grew to become \u2018respectable\u2019 galaxies such as our own Milky Way. But the results of numerical simulations 2  suggest that the very first stars may have been quite different from those that came later. They probably contained only atoms of light nuclei produced in the Big Bang \u2014 so no heavy elements such as carbon and oxygen. They are also likely to have been very massive, over a hundred times more massive than the Sun. When these heavyweights switched on, they would have burnt up their hydrogen in only a few million years, shining intensely and briefly in a brilliant dawn of starlight. Detecting and studying these first stars will be a specific task for the 6.5-metre-aperture James Webb Space Telescope \u2014 successor to the 2.5-metre Hubble Space Telescope \u2014 that is projected to enter orbit in 2013. Kashlinsky and colleagues' observations 1  come from a more modest-sized instrument, the Infrared Array Camera (IRAC) on board NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope. The technique they use \u2014 that of analysing ripples in the background sky \u2014 is well established in cosmology: observations of ripples at microwave frequencies produced soon after the Big Bang (the so-called cosmic microwave background) gave us precise measurements of the constituents and geometry of the Universe. IRAC detects light at infrared wavelengths between 3.6 and 8 micrometres, and is sensitive to the light of young stars that has been redshifted (moved to longer wavelengths) by a factor of between 20 and 50 by the expansion of the cosmos since its emission. This light would have originated at a time when the Universe was only 100 million years old \u2014 an infant in terms of its stately 13.7 billion years today. Spitzer, with its 85-centimetre aperture, does not have the angular resolution to resolve individual sources at these enormous distances. But it might well be capable of detecting distant stars' combined output as structure in the light produced behind that of foreground sources. And here lies the observational challenge: Spitzer's IRAC detectors are also sensitive to diffuse light that is produced within the Solar System, in clouds of cool gas in our Galaxy and, crucially, from galaxies \u2014 those close by, as well as those a long way back in cosmic time. Even a minor blunder in removing these foreground signals might lead to a spurious result. Although several groups have tentatively claimed to have seen fluctuations from early starlight on the basis of previous infrared space missions 3 , 4 , the increased depth of the IRAC images means that Kashlinsky  et al . 1  could reduce the confusing signals from foreground galaxies to fainter upper limits ( Fig. 1 ). They present several tests to demonstrate the reliability of their detected signal and the origin they claim for it. The pattern of structure they see, for example, is statistically similar at four different infrared wavelengths, and is consistent across fields whose sky coordinates are very different (so an origin in the Milky Way is unlikely). The signal does not change between two measurements taken six months apart, as would be the case if its origin were \u2018zodiacal\u2019 light reflected by local interplanetary dust in the Solar System. The authors use various methods to remove the signals coming from faint galaxies, none of which significantly alters their result. Remarkably, however, the total contribution of foreground galaxies, estimated by extrapolating to include those too faint to be resolved in the deepest IRAC images 5 , is small compared with the residual signal, which the authors ascribe to primordial stars. Kashlinsky  et al . argue that this is further proof of their signal's origin, because only a very large error in the amount of foreground galaxy clustering would make the residual signal disappear. Because the clustering observed in the background will be diluted if the first stars switch on gradually over a range in cosmic times, the prominent signal might conceivably arise because it was produced in a very short time interval. But the imbalance still seems a surprising outcome, and a number of untested assumptions involved in allowing for unobserved galaxies could represent a weakness in the analysis. Kashlinsky and colleagues, perhaps wisely, do not interpret their signal in much detail. Theorists have predicted the level of fluctuations that might be seen in such experiments 6 ; but their calculations, too, depend on many imponderables. The genuine excitement in this work lies in the practicality of detecting the stellar radiation from hitherto uncharted distances corresponding to a time when the Universe was barely 100 million years old.

But simply travelling along a nucleic acid in one direction seems not to be enough for some of these molecular motors. Proteins of the helicase family are essential for almost all biological processes involving nucleic acids such as DNA, from the replication of the genome to the production of proteins 1 , 2 . Although these enzymes are mainly known for their ability to unwind DNA or RNA helices, it has become increasingly clear that they can have many other activities. For example, helicases can displace proteins from nucleic acids and remodel nucleosomes \u2014 the protein complexes around which DNA coils 3 , 4 . To account for some of the diverse activities of helicases, it has been proposed, and in a few cases shown, that these enzymes behave more like motor proteins, which move along a strand of DNA or RNA, fuelled by ATP (the cell's energy currency) 5 . On  page 1321  of this issue, Myong  et al . 6  add an unexpected twist to the repertoire of proteins that travel along nucleic acids \u2014 the astonishingly complex movement of the bacterial helicase Rep along single-stranded DNA. Rep from  Escherichia coli  is involved in the replication of the bacterial genome, where it helps to restart stalled replication intermediates 7 . Quite how it does this is not known. However, the DNA helicase activity of Rep is well understood, and it is clear that Rep must double up to form a dimer before it can unzip DNA 1 , 8 . A single Rep molecule \u2014 a Rep monomer \u2014 cannot unwind helices, but it can move along single-stranded DNA 8 . Whether Rep exists in the cell as a dimer, a monomer, or both, is not known. To investigate how Rep travels, Myong  et al . 6  used a single-molecule fluorescence technique to follow the movement of individual Rep monomers along single-stranded DNA ( Fig. 1 ). In the presence of ATP, Rep monomers slid along DNA in the expected 3\u2032 to 5\u2032 direction. But the authors wondered what would happen if a Rep monomer encountered an obstacle on the DNA. They therefore added a second piece of DNA to form a helix in front of the monomer. A helix creates an insurmountable barrier for the Rep monomer 8 , and Rep would be expected either to fall off the DNA or to grind to a halt, remaining in front of the helix. Neither happens. Instead, Rep reaches behind itself, grabs the stretch of DNA it has just traversed, forms a loop with it, and then releases the DNA near the blockade \u2014 ending up close to the spot on the DNA where it began its journey ( Fig. 1 ). The authors call this series of coordinated events \u2018snap-back\u2019, and Rep goes through many cycles of sliding forward and snapping back. Such \u2018shuttling\u2019 cycles also occurred when Rep encountered other obstacles on single-stranded DNA, such as bound molecules of the protein streptavidin. To find out how Rep snaps back, Myong  et al . monitored changes in the shape of the protein during the shuttling cycle. Throughout the sliding leg of the cycle, Rep seems to change conformation rapidly; but as it runs into the blockade, it favours one particular conformation. The authors hypothesize that this conformation exposes or creates an additional binding site for single-stranded DNA that allows Rep also to bind the DNA over which it has just travelled. As a result, a DNA loop forms, causing Rep to release the DNA at the blockade and to snap back ( Fig. 1 ). Myong and colleagues also show that Rep does not require a free DNA-end to snap back. The relocation of Rep to near the end of the single-stranded DNA fragments is presumably dictated by the stiffness of the DNA strand. Although further experiments are required to discover where Rep binds to the DNA strand, and how the various DNA-binding events are coordinated, the data clearly indicate that a complex movement of a single enzyme molecule on DNA can occur in a few, relatively simple steps. Why would it be useful for a motor to shuttle on its track? Myong  et al . suggest that Rep might repeatedly strip off other proteins from DNA as it restarts stalled DNA replication. The ubiquitous DNA-binding protein RecA, for example, has been proposed to bind to DNA replication intermediates and so interfere with the restart of replication 9 . If true, RecA binding might need to be actively prevented, but it is not known how this is accomplished. The authors show that shuttling Rep can efficiently clear RecA from single-stranded DNA. It remains to be seen whether this process occurs in the cell. However, Rep's ability to continually displace RecA while shuttling on single-stranded DNA provides an attractive hypothesis for a physiological function for Rep. Because the removal of proteins from nucleic acids is assumed to be a core function of enzymes of the helicase families, it will be illuminating to test whether other family members also shuttle back and forth like Rep. It will also be useful to discover whether the snap-back mechanism allows Rep or other enzymes to switch from one nucleic-acid strand to another, which could simplify the coordination of complex structural changes during DNA or RNA transactions. Therefore, when considering possible roles for a \u2018helicase\u2019 in the future, we should not immediately search for the helix that the enzyme unzips, but instead remember how Rep snaps back.

But a silicon-based structure that can modulate light from an independent source might aid the marriage of optical and electronic components. Electronic components made of silicon have so far coped with almost every new challenge in the processing and storage of data. But substantial further progress might only be possible if optical (light-based) technology is used to help distribute or communicate information within, or possibly between, processors 1 , 2 . On  page 1334  of this issue 3 , Kuo and colleagues report the first observation in a germanium\u2013silicon semiconductor structure of an optical effect \u2014 the quantum-confined Stark effect. Their find could lead to the fabrication of silicon-based integrated circuits containing both electronic and optical components. The optical telecommunications networks that span the globe cope with separated electronic and optical technologies. But within a compact processing or computing system, the benefits of monolithic integration \u2014 reduced cost, improved reliability and simpler packaging \u2014 are more salient. Attempts to use optical and electronic parts together in such a system, however, have always run into the problem that light-emitting optical components are made from compound semiconductors that have a very different crystal structure from the silicon so successfully used for semiconduc-tor electronics \u2014 making integration of the two difficult. Although silicon can absorb light, and convert it into an electrical signal, it does not itself easily give out light \u2014 unlike some other semiconductor crystals that can be used to construct lasers. Silicon belongs to a class of semiconductors known as indirect-band-gap semiconductors. In such materials, light-emitting transitions between electrons in the high-energy conduction band states (which can move around the crystal and contribute to electronic conduction) and those in the lower-energy valence band states (which are localized to a particular atom) are not allowed. Over the years, attempts to get around this problem have met with little real success, and interest has shifted from the possibilities offered by silicon-based lasers to those of silicon-based optical modulators 2 . A modulator is analogous to a camera shutter: it transmits light when it is open, but absorbs light when it is closed. Depending on the voltage applied by the neighbouring electronic components, the modulator will either transmit or absorb a remotely generated, continuous laser beam that is directed on to it. This method of controlling light output is just as good as if the modulating material produced the light itself. The best optical modulators are based on compound semiconductor materials that use the quantum-confined Stark effect 4 , in which the allowed energy levels of electrons in very thin layers (typically 10 nanometres) change when an electric field is applied. These modulators can operate at low voltages and can be switched from an \u2018on\u2019 to an \u2018off\u2019 state at even higher frequencies than is possible using lasers. Kuo  et al . 3  observe, for the first time, the quantum-confined Stark effect in crystalline germanium layers grown on silicon wafers. Unlike compound semiconductors, germanium (Ge) and its alloy silicon\u2013germanium (SiGe) are perfectly acceptable materials for use in silicon electronics, as they have a similar crystal structure to that of silicon. The layers of Ge used by Kuo  et al . are 10 nanometres thick, and ten of these are separated by SiGe layers, each 16 nanometres thick. These SiGe separating layers form a barrier to electrons and confine them in the thin layers of Ge. As a result, the energy levels of these electrons differ from the energy levels of the electrons found in the bulk crystal; the exact energy levels can be calculated quantum mechanically taking into account the shape of the well. The thicknesses of the layers are chosen so that, when no voltage is applied, incident photons do not have sufficient energy to be absorbed (for that to happen, they would need enough energy to kick an electron in the structure into the next quantum-mechanically allowed energy level). But when a voltage is applied, the electric field changes the shape of the energy well, and the allowed energy levels of the electrons change sufficiently that the incident photons can be absorbed. Thus Ge\u2013SiGe absorbs or transmits light according to an electronic signal from neighbouring electronic components \u2014 it acts as a modulator. Although understood and used for 20 years in compound semiconductors for optical communication purposes 4 , this effect was not expected to be found in Ge\u2013SiGe. This is because germanium, like silicon, is an indirect band-gap material. The ingenious technique reported in Kuo and colleagues' paper 3  involves absorbing photons to higher energy levels in the conduction band of the germanium quantum wells. This takes advantage of the fact that transitions between those selected energy levels \u2014 unlike those between the lowest conduction and valence bands \u2014 are allowed. The effect that the authors observe is as strong as that seen in compound semiconductors. Further developments must occur before we see a fully integrated silicon optoelectronic circuit. For example, most silicon electronic circuits are produced by the deposition of various oxide and metallic layers, whereas the structures used by Kuo  et al . are produced by crystal growth. The authors are confident that their different fabrication process is suitable for mass production. Let's hope they are right. Reprints and Permissions"},

The material, described by C. M. Elvin  et al . in this issue ( Nature   437 , 999\u20131002; 2005), is, perhaps unsurprisingly, rubbery and highly resilient; indeed, some of its properties exceed those of a material used to make bouncy balls for the playground. The elastic protein resilin, the source of the authors' inspiration, comes from the same family of biomacromolecules as spider silk and elastin (a protein that makes animal tissues flexible). It is, in fact, found in most insects, where it facilitates not just jumping, but also many actions requiring efficient energy storage and rapid repetitive movement \u2014 the chirping of cicadas and the flapping of dragonflies' wings being other examples. Elvin  et al . produced their polymer by first cloning part of a  Drosophila  fruitfly gene and expressing it in  Escherichia coli  bacteria. They thus produced large quantities of a peptide found in a precursor molecule to resilin that contains 17 repeats of an amino-acid sequence thought to be responsible for elasticity. A photochemical reaction established crosslinks in the peptide to produce a solid material. The result, a thread about one millimetre across, glowed blue when bathed in ultraviolet light (see image), and was easily cast into a range of shapes. Its ability to recover from deformation (the property known as resilience) was as good as that of natural resilin taken from a wing tendon of a dragonfly. It was also similar to that reported for elastin, and far higher than that of several synthetic rubbery polymers. A strip of the crosslinked resilin could be stretched to more than three times its original length without breaking. The authors attribute the mechanical properties of the polymer to the three-dimensional amorphous nature of the crosslinked protein matrix. They also believe that a clearer understanding of the part played by water as a solvent and plasticizer could lead to the development of a whole new range of rubbery materials. Meanwhile, they suggest, their jumping-flea polymer could be a leap forward for biomedical and other engineering fields. Reprints and Permissions"},

That those stars are there to be influenced, though, raises other questions. Observations of stellar dynamics have so far revealed compact, dark masses at the centre of almost 40 galaxies 1 . These are commonly assumed to be supermassive black holes \u2014 collapsed massive objects whose gravitational pull is so great that no light or matter can escape them. In most cases, however, what is seen is also consistent with the dark masses being simply clusters of dark stars. The exceptions are the dark masses at the core of the galaxy NGC 4258, in our own Milky Way and now, as Bender  et al . 2  report in  The Astrophysical Journal , in our near neighbour the Andromeda galaxy. Without actually seeing the dark pit it creates by absorbing or bending all the light incident upon it 3 , 4 , the most compelling method to prove the existence of a black hole is to constrain its size and mass. If a very massive object is confined to a compact region within a critical \u2018Schwarzschild\u2019 radius dictated by the general theory of relativity, its gravitational pull so warps space-time that this wraps round to enclose the body, preventing anything escaping. To fulfil this criterion and so be considered a black hole, the object of three million solar masses that lurks at the centre of our Galaxy, for example, must be five times smaller than Mercury's orbit around the Sun. To measure whether a dark mass of unknown provenance is a black hole, one must first find an object moving under its influence: in newtonian mechanics, the speed of an orbiting object, together with its radius from the central source of gravity, is sufficient to determine that source's mass. The extreme gravitational pull of a black hole makes it difficult to find objects near it, let alone measure their speed. But if a close-orbiting object can be found, it can be used to rule out other potential identities for the central mass concentration: if the orbital radius is smaller than the size of other distributions of matter, such as a neutrino ball or a cluster of dark, dead stars, the only remaining viable possibility for the gravitational source is a black hole. The nucleus of Andromeda comprises a central dark-matter distribution and \u2014 as we now know, thanks to remarkable observations from the Hubble Space Telescope \u2014 not one, but three concentrations of starlight. Two of these, commonly labelled P1 and P2 (peaks 1 and 2), were known previously 5 . Conventional wisdom 6  has it that they are merely the opposite ends of an elliptical distribution of old stars orbiting the central distribution, which is near P2 at one focus of the ellipse. Bender and colleagues 2 , however, now confirm the existence of a third stellar component, P3, a tiny nucleus of hot, blue stars embedded within P2 ( Fig. 1 ). An unusual blue concentration in P2 had been noted earlier 7 , but the fact that it constitutes a compact disk of stars, separate from P2, has been established only with the latest observations. Ironically, stars such as these have no business being so close to a black hole \u2014 yet, following the reasoning above, their existence there rules out any other explanation for the concentration of mass in Andromeda's nucleus other than it's being a black hole. Despite its small size (barely a light year across), P3 contains stars with the highest average circular rotation velocity \u2014 almost 1,700 kilometres per second \u2014 measured so far in any galaxy. According to Newton's law of gravity, the central mass required to corral such fast stars so close to the nucleus exceeds that of 100 million Suns, rendering Andromeda's black hole at least 30 times bigger than its counterpart at the heart of the Milky Way. For other dark objects, such as brown dwarfs (stars that have failed to ignite) or dead stars, to mimic such a single massive object, more than 100 million of them would have to be concentrated within a region only a third of a light year across. The collisions that would ensue would destroy this structure in only a few million years, so it would not have lasted long enough for us to see it. But there remains the problem of the age of the roughly 400 stars that form P3. They are bright and blue, and therefore very young compared with the age of the Andromeda galaxy; most of them must have formed less than 200 million years ago. So did these stars form  in situ , or did they migrate from farther out? Given their short lifespan, it is very difficult to see how they could have diffused inwards (and still be visible as young stars now) through two-body interactions. The alternative is that they formed where they are now, through the collapse of infalling molecular clouds. But the gravity of the black hole, and the extreme physical conditions at the centre of Andromeda, would greatly inhibit star formation unless the cloud density were many orders of magnitude greater \u2014 thus facilitating gravitational condensation into stars \u2014 than is generally encountered there. The situation of the stars orbiting the black hole at the centre of our own Galaxy is also bizarre 8 , 9 . Young stars, less than 10 million years old, are assembled there into two counter-rotating disks; closer still to the centre, some 20 stars orbit within only a few light days of the black hole, some at speeds that can exceed 5,000 kilometres per second. One possible explanation for these close, young stars is that two clouds of matter fell into the black hole together, each colliding and compressing the gas of the other such that the material could clump together, thus overcoming the many factors that would otherwise inhibit their contraction into stars 9 . Although improbable, this may explain what we see in the Galactic Centre; it is less likely to account for the single disk of stars seen in P3 at the nucleus of Andromeda. Thus, although the unknown dark-mass concentrations at the nucleus of many galaxies are conforming to what is becoming the \u2018standard model\u2019 of black holes 10 , other mysteries of similar opacity are emerging. As Bender  et al . note, there is no plausible explanation of how and why the hot, young stars near the centre of the Milky Way and Andromeda got there. It seems that only a new theory of star formation in the chaotic environment surrounding a supermassive object will suffice. For the positive identification of Andromeda's centre, black-hole enthusiasts are thankful nonetheless. Reprints and Permissions"},

Kondrashov"}], "parsed_as_year": "2006_or_before", "body": "A comparison of two fruitfly genomes shows that much of their non-coding DNA is controlled by either negative or positive selection, dealing a double blow to the neutral theory of molecular evolution. Once upon a time, the world seemed simple when viewed through the eyes of evolutionary biologists. All genomes were tightly controlled by various forms of natural selection. DNA encoded functional genes, and most mutations that occurred were rejected through negative selection. Those exceptional mutations that were beneficial substituted for the original gene variant (allele) and spread through the evolving populations by positive selection. And polymorphisms \u2014 where several alleles coexist within a population \u2014 were maintained by yet another, balancing, form of selection. This idyllic world begun to crumble in 1968, when Kimura 1  made his modest proposal that most allele substitutions and polymorphisms do not substantially affect an organism's fitness and are governed, not by positive or balancing selection, but by random drift. Kimura still allowed for negative selection to eliminate most new mutations, so this proposal can be regarded as \u2018weak neutralism\u2019. However, a decade later the onset of large-scale genome sequencing led to the discovery of genes that were so degraded as to be no longer functional (pseudogenes) and of other junk DNA. This led to \u2018strong neutralism\u2019, which claims that regions of genomes that do not encode proteins consist mostly of functionless DNA, ignored by all forms of selection 2 . Indeed, current estimates of the fraction of functionally important segments in mammalian non-coding sequences range from 10\u201315% (ref.  3 ) to just 3% (ref.  4 ). On  page 1149  of this issue, however, Andolfatto 5  reports a strikingly pre-neutralist pattern for a sample of fruitfly genomes, those of  Drosophila melanogaster  and  Drosophila simulans . First, he compared non-coding nucleotide sites with synonymous sites \u2014 protein-coding sites where, because of the redundancies in the nucleotide triplet code, a substitution would not alter the encoded amino acid. The synonymous sites were used as a paradigm of neutrality, for want of a better one. Andolfatto found reduced levels of interspecies divergence and of intraspecies polymorphism within  D. melanogaster , suggesting that around 50% of non-coding sites in  Drosophila  are affected by negative selection more strongly than synonymous sites. So because synonymous sites are also subject to some negative selection in  Drosophila 6 , most of the fly's non-coding sequences must be under some functional constraint. Second, a substantial fraction of those nucleotide substitutions that do occur in non-coding  Drosophila  sequences are driven by positive selection. This conclusion follows from the results of the McDonald\u2013Kreitman test, a statistical analysis that detects positive selection acting on certain kinds of nucleotide sites from the excess of substitutions, relative to polymorphisms, at these sites 7 . So, if Andolfatto's results are confirmed by further genome-scale analyses, neither strong nor even weak neutralism describes the evolution of the  D. melanogaster  and  D. simulans  genomes. Can the neutral theory survive this double blow? Easily, because, unlike the fruitfly genomes, mammalian genomes are certainly full of junk. Although some originally junk sequences can be recruited to perform a function, and so become subject to selection 8 , 9 , there is little doubt that substitutions and polymorphisms are, indeed, effectively neutral in the bulk of mammalian non-coding DNA. At least two classes should therefore be recognized among the genomes of multicellular eukaryotes, which have long non-coding regions. Negative selection in mammals, and more generally in vertebrates, is so weak or inefficient (presumably because of their low effective population sizes) that even long segments of junk DNA often spread through the population. As a result, bloated and mostly neutral mammal-like genomes evolve. By contrast, genomes of  D. melanogaster  and its close relatives (although not all of  Drosophila ), and probably those of many other species, are protected from the rampant accumulation of junk DNA by efficient selection. In  D. melanogaster , individual transposable elements (jumping DNA segments) are mostly kept at low frequencies 10 , introns (segments of non-coding DNA within genes) are comparatively short, and pseudogenes are few 11 . In such species, selection maintains lean and mostly functional melanogaster-like genomes. Although the neutral theory will survive Andolfatto's demonstration that there is pervasive selection in  Drosophila , its original justification may not. Kimura 1  claimed that most substitutions must be neutral because positive selection driving all of them would incur too high a fitness cost. However, it is now known that the \u2018lag load\u2019 12  associated with even rapid adaptive evolution is not necessarily very high 13 . So Andolfatto's conclusion that one selection-driven substitution has occurred about every ten generations since  D. melanogaster  and  D. simulans  diverged seems reasonable theoretically. If flies can do it, so could others, invalidating Kimura's original argument. In  Drosophila , the relatively junk-free regions between genes, which probably regulate gene expression, seem to be a major target of positive selection. It is therefore fair to assume that the accumulation of beneficial mutations also had a major role in the evolution of functional segments in the intergenic regions in mammal-like genomes. However, nature is queerer than we may think. Since the human\u2013chimpanzee divergence, functionally important intergenic segments have incorporated many deleterious mutations, rather than beneficial ones, perhaps because of the relatively recent decline of the effective population size in hominids 14 . We do not yet know how quickly beneficial mutations accumulate in functional segments of mammal-like genomes in the lineages where efficiency of selection did not decline. The total number of functionally important nucleotides in the genome,  T , is crucially important for estimating the genomic deleterious mutation rate  U , a key parameter in evolutionary genetics 15 . Indeed, in a diploid organism,  U =2 T\u00b5 , and  \u00b5 , the per nucleotide mutation rate, can be measured directly. Andolfatto's data and analysis suggest that, when  U  is estimated for  D. melanogaster ,  \u00b5  must be multiplied by about 2\u00d710 8 . Recently,  \u00b5 =2\u00d710 \u22128  was reported in the nematode worm  Caenorhabditis elegans 16 , and analogous data for  Drosophila  are expected soon. These data will have profound implications for a variety of outstanding problems in evolutionary biology, in particular with regard to the evolution of sex. It is truly amazing how little we know quantitatively about mutation and selection in the genomes of even the most well-studied organisms. Reprints and Permissions"},

Kastan"}], "parsed_as_year": "2006_or_before", "body": "Cells have many ways of coping with damage to their DNA, but how are these all coordinated? It seems that BID \u2014 a regulator of programmed cell death \u2014 stands at the crossroads of several damage-response pathways. Exposure to DNA-damaging agents can cause mutations, developmental abnormalities or cancer, and cells have developed numerous ways to minimize these effects. Such mechanisms include cell-cycle checkpoints to prohibit damaged cells from dividing while the cell deals with the damage; processes to repair the DNA; and programmed cell death (apoptosis). Although it makes sense that there should be coordinated regulation of these different processes, they have mostly been studied as independent pathways. A new link between these mechanisms comes from work reported in  Cell  by Zinkel  et al . 1  and Kamer  et al . 2  demonstrating an unexpected role for the protein BID, a known regulator of apoptosis, in the control of cell-cycle progression following DNA damage. Apoptosis can be initiated by external signals from other cells \u2014 TNF-\u03b1, for instance, which is released by certain immune cells to kill infected cells \u2014 or by internal warnings resulting from DNA damage or other cellular stresses. Regardless of the stimulus, the death process is controlled by one of several signalling pathways, all of which include one or more members of the BCL-2 family of proteins. The binding of external factors to their cognate \u2018death receptors\u2019 on the cell surface leads to the cleavage and activation of BID 3  \u2014 a BCL-2 family member. BID, in turn, activates BAX and BAK, both of which are BCL-2 proteins that then trigger apoptosis ( Fig. 1 ) 4 . By contrast, DNA damage causes activation of the ATM or ATR protein kinases (enzymes that phosphorylate certain target proteins), and this activation leads to a rise in p53 protein levels 5 . This protein can switch on a number of target genes, including those encoding the BCL-2 family members BAX, PUMA and NOXA, each of which contributes to apoptosis in specific cell types 6 . In certain cell types or physiological settings, however, the induction of p53 protein, instead of initiating apoptosis, causes arrest of the cell cycle at the G1 phase. Moreover, other targets of ATM and ATR also contribute to cell-cycle arrest in the S and G2/M phases 5 . Previously, the p53-dependent activation of the genes encoding BAX, PUMA and NOXA was thought to be the main link between DNA damage and the control of apoptosis. Now, Zinkel  et al . 1  and Kamer  et al . 2  show that another pathway links the control of apoptosis to that of the cell-cycle arrest following DNA damage. Both groups found that BID is phosphorylated in an ATM-dependent manner after DNA damage and that some of the BID protein then moves into the nucleus. Unexpectedly, both groups also found that arrest of the cell cycle in S phase in response to DNA damage requires BID phosphorylation. Moreover, the domains of the BID protein responsible for control of the cell cycle are distinct from that involved in its apoptotic function. These observations add BID to a surprisingly long list of proteins that are phosphorylated by ATM or ATR to control the progression through the cell cycle after DNA damage ( Fig. 1 ). Furthermore, Zinkel  et al . 1  demonstrate that cells lacking BID suffer more chromosomal aberrations after DNA damage than those that have BID, raising the possibility that this protein participates in repair of the DNA as well as in cell-cycle control and apoptosis. Although the two papers agree in several aspects, there are some apparent discrepancies and some findings that require further clarification. The importance of BID and its phosphorylation by ATM in influencing cell survival following DNA damage varied in different experiments in the two papers. These discrepancies may have resulted from differences in cell types, agents or doses used, but they need to be explained if we are to understand the physiological roles of this branch of the ATM pathway. Furthermore, there were inconsistencies between the two studies regarding which DNA damaging agents activate the ATM\u2013BID pathway. For example, Zinkel  et al . 1  found that ATM was required for BID phosphorylation following exposure to many different types of agents, including hydroxyurea and ultraviolet light, whereas Kamer  et al . 2  observed BID phosphorylation and ATM-dependence only after treatment with agents that introduce breaks in DNA strands, such as ionizing irradiation and the drug etoposide. The specificity of ATM-dependence for responses to ionizing irradiation would be consistent with a large amount of data in the literature 5 . Although there are some confusing results, the two papers convincingly establish that the apoptotic protein BID is a target of ATM and that it has an unanticipated role in controlling cell-cycle progression following DNA damage. The data demonstrate that BID and ATM come together in one arm of one pathway, but also underscore the notion that the two proteins have other distinctive biochemical and functional roles. Thus, it is not surprising that the effects of their loss are quite different: mice lacking BID develop a blood disorder resembling chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia 7 , whereas mice and humans lacking ATM develop acute lymphoid leukaemias and lymphomas 8 . It makes sense that cells would have a multi-pronged, coordinated response to stresses such as DNA damage, because it would be advantageous to simultaneously control DNA repair, cell-cycle progression and programmed cell death. BID is unlikely to be the last example of a protein that stands at a crossroads to influence multiple parts of the stress response. Reprints and Permissions"},

They can even measure the quickening of an atom's \u2018pulse\u2019 as it flies past a surface. Particles sometimes act like waves, and waves sometimes act like particles. This phenomenon, known as wave\u2013particle duality, may seem to confuse what are (to everyday experience at least) two separate and unambiguous concepts. But 100 years after Albert Einstein first introduced the idea of waves behaving like particles to explain the photoelectric effect, and more than 80 years after the French physicist Louis de Broglie proposed the converse behaviour, wave\u2013particle duality has become a staple food of the quantum diet. Writing in  Physical Review Letters 1 , John Perreault and Alexander Cronin expose a further experimental ramification of the effect, by measuring the shift in phase \u2014 a wave property \u2014 of an atom as it flies past, and interacts with, a surface. In doing so, they take advantage of matter-wave interferometry, a technique that has in recent decades given fresh impetus to studies of the wave-like nature of particles. Pioneered for simple particles such as electrons 2  and neutrons (ref.  3  and references therein), the technique has since been extended to larger particles such as atoms and molecules (ref.  4  and references therein). Interferometry as a generalized technique involves the superposition of two waves to gain information about their relative phase \u2014 where in their cycle they are in relation to each other. A simple analogy is a zip-fastener: for proper zipping, the teeth of one strand must fit perfectly with those of the other. If, however, they are shifted such that the teeth oppose each other, the zipper won't close. Analogously, if the peaks of one wave are next to the troughs of the other, the waves are perfectly out of phase, and their amplitudes cancel out \u2014 they interfere \u2018destructively\u2019. Conversely, if the two waves are perfectly in phase, with the peaks and troughs matching, they interfere constructively to produce a net amplitude that is the sum of the two individual amplitudes. In an interferometer, an incoming wave is split into two branches. One of these branches is subjected to an outside influence that slows down or speeds up the atom-wave's cycle, or pulse, thus shifting its phase relative to that of the other branch. These two branches are then brought back together and interfere, the amplitude of the resulting wave being proportional to the degree to which the two waves are in phase. Generally in wave mechanics only intensities \u2014 the squares of the amplitudes \u2014 can be measured, so phase information is lost. The power of interferometry is that it transforms a shift in phase to a change in amplitude, which can be measured as change in intensity. And so it is in Perreault and Cronin's experiment 1 . They make use of a Mach\u2013Zehnder interferometer, in which a nanoscale grating is used to diffract atomic waves, thus acting as a matter-beam splitter 5 . The authors inserted a further 250-nm-thick membrane with thousands of 50-nm-wide slits into one branch of this interferometer. As they pass through this additional membrane, the atoms experience a weak, attractive van der Waals force through electronic coupling with the membrane's walls. This interaction speeds up the atoms' pulse \u2014 the phase of the atom-wave becomes shifted with respect to the free-atom wave in the interferometer's other branch. From the measured interference, the phase shift caused by the atom\u2013surface interaction can be exactly quantified. This measurable change in the interference pattern arises from an atomic interaction that occurs over a distance up to 1,000 times that of an atomic diameter. Perreault and Cronin are, to their knowledge, the first to determine directly the phase shift caused by the van der Waals interaction between an atom and a surface. The acceleration towards the surface of the channels experienced by the sodium atom-waves is more than a million times that caused by Earth's gravitational field. The channels are, however, very short, so the actual time difference measured by the interferometer is only about 100 attoseconds (10 \u221216  seconds). Contrasting this with the overall flight time through the device of around one millisecond gives an idea of the exquisite sensitivity possible with interference experiments. This experiment is a beautiful example of the many tools that are being developed in a true renaissance in the study of atom\u2013surface interactions 6 . The potential impact of such work stems from its connection to the fields of nanotechnology and atom optics. Nanometre-scale structures could lead to smaller transistors and motors, or the ability to assemble molecules atom by atom. Exploiting the wave behaviour of atoms could lead the way to more precise gyroscopes for navigation, gravity gradiometers for subterranean mapping and other field sensors. The work of Perreault and Cronin 1  lies at the intersection of these two fields, putting a limit on how small nanotechnological and atom-optical devices can be made before the van der Waals interaction disrupts their operation.

But the ammunition is larger than the bore of the bacterial gun, so how is it fed into the machine? Bacteria and the organisms they parasitize are engaged in a constant struggle. Each side possesses a veritable arsenal of weapons and defensive countermeasures. One of the most potent weapons systems that bacteria use is the type III secretion system, which injects certain bacterial proteins into adjacent host cells. The proteins selected by the secretion machinery often resemble the host's own proteins, so they can switch off defensive systems and turn the cells into puppets of a bacterial master. In this issue, Akeda and Gal\u00e1n ( page 911 ) 1  give us a first peek into the loading mechanism of the bacterial type III secretion system. The crystal structures of proteins that are transported by the type III secretion machine have been solved 2 . The diameter of the conduit these proteins must travel has also been ascertained 3 . A paradox emerges when these data are compared \u2014 the proteins are too large to travel through the secretory apparatus. So how do bacteria get the camel to pass through the eye of a needle? A solution suggested by Akeda and Gal\u00e1n implicates InvC, an essential component of the  Salmonella enterica  type III machinery. InvC belongs to a class of enzymes called AAA ATPases that form a hexameric ring. These enzymes harness the energy released from ATP to unfold proteins and thread them through a channel at the centre of the ring 4 . Akeda and Gal\u00e1n reasoned that if InvC behaved like this at the breech of the type III secretion machine, secreted proteins would be of the correct calibre to pass through. Their careful  in vitro  examination of the SptP protein, which is transported by the  S. enterica  type III system, supports this idea. Before secretion, SptP is bound by a \u2018chaperone\u2019 called SicP 2 , which is essential for its recognition by the secretion machinery. The authors found that InvC binds to the SptP\u2013SicP 2  complex; that the consumption of energy by InvC releases SicP 2 ; and finally, that the SptP that is also liberated is in an unfolded state 1  ( Fig. 1 ). Akeda and Gal\u00e1n's hypothesis has several attractive features: InvC is associated with the cell membrane; it could therefore reside at the site where the pipeline into the host cell meets the bacterial cytoplasm, where there is a pool of substrate proteins to be secreted 5 . Moreover, because InvC can indirectly bind to secretion substrates through their cognate chaperones, it performs all the functions that are needed for the priming of proteins for type III travel: recognition, release of chaperones, and unfolding. Other secretion machines may indeed use similar mechanisms for substrate selection by chaperone binding, and these include  Escherichia coli  type III machines as well as the secretion of proteins that make up flagella (the whip-like \u2018tails\u2019 that propel some bacteria) 6 , 7 . This work may conveniently solve another puzzle: where does the energy for substrate travel come from? If InvC acts as the pumping station at the end of a pipeline, it is conceivable that the energy it invests in pushing substrates in one end is sufficient to shunt previously pumped substrates out of the other. Given our current understanding of InvC, it is tempting to take the view that secretion substrates dock with InvC through their bound chaperones. Following chaperone displacement, a substrate would then be sucked in through the ring and unwound like a strand of spaghetti. The closely related flagellar assembly and secretion system has an InvC equivalent. In this system, the other components of the secretory machinery that face the interior of the bacterium can recognize not only substrates for secretion but also each other 8 . One of these proteins can even modulate the rate of ATP consumption of the InvC equivalent and another is part of the membrane-embedded secretion machinery 8 , 9 . So it seems likely that a complex web of interactions modulating InvC activity and specificity remains to be discovered, thereby providing even greater insight into the mechanisms by which bacteria load their type III weaponry.

Hermann Bondi, who died on 10 September aged 85, is perhaps best known as one of the original advocates of the steady-state theory of the Universe, advanced as an alternative to the now dominant Big Bang theory. But as an astrophysicist, mathematician and cosmologist, his interests were wide-ranging and his intellectual brilliance undoubted. As a scientific adviser to successive British governments, he also contributed immensely to the public life of his adopted country. Bondi was born in Austria to Jewish parents. As a schoolboy in Vienna he showed precocious mathematical ability, and decided that he wanted to work with the renowned mathematician and astronomer Arthur Eddington at the University of Cambridge. Bondi arrived at the university's Trinity College in 1937. In March 1938, German troops entered Austria and  Anschluss  was proclaimed. Bondi's parents and sister followed his cabled advice to \u201cdrop everything and leave\u201d, settling eventually in New York; he himself, an anglophile, remained based in England for the rest of his life. In the panic following the collapse of France in 1940, Bondi was interned on the Isle of Man and then in Canada. With typical resourcefulness, he helped set up a camp university at which he gave lectures on mathematics. In Canada, he met a fellow Viennese internee, Thomas Gold, who became his lifelong friend and collaborator. On their return to Britain in 1941, Bondi and Gold joined the Admiralty's radar research group, led by Fred Hoyle. It was this trio's off-duty discussions on astronomy that were to bear fruit when they returned to Cambridge at the end of the war. This was a time of momentous advances in astrophysics. In the late 1930s, Hans Bethe and Carl-Friedrich von Weizs\u00e4cker had shown that, at the high temperatures inside stars, energy liberated from the nuclear fusion of hydrogen to form helium could supply stellar luminosity. This led Hoyle and Ray Lyttleton to a reappraisal of the physics and mathematics of stellar structure developed by Bondi's hero Eddington. Together with his wife Christine \u2014 one of Hoyle's doctoral students \u2014 Bondi transformed these equations, so simplifying the construction of stellar models, especially those of chemically inhomogeneous stars. Bondi's student, Roger Tayler, exploited their technique further in a thesis that foreshadowed the now established picture of stellar evolution through nuclear processing from the main sequence to the giant branch. Bondi also applied his mathematical skill to various problems in cosmic gas dynamics. In particular, he wrote an elegant paper on the spherically symmetric, pressure-limited gravitational accretion of interstellar gas by a star at rest in a gas cloud. An earlier paper, written with Hoyle and Lyttleton, had argued that gravitational energy released by accreted gas heats the corona of the Sun to more than a million degrees. Although coronal heating is now known to come from the dissipation of energy propagating outwards from the Sun, the resulting coronal expansion \u2014 the \u2018solar wind\u2019 \u2014 is most simply described by changing the boundary conditions in Bondi's spherical accretion model to yield an analogous flow with opposite sign. But Bondi is undoubtedly best known for his partnership with Hoyle and Gold in the advocacy and detailed study of steady-state cosmology. In this model, the expansion of the Universe \u2014 inferred by Edwin Hubble from the redshifted spectral lines of distant galaxies \u2014 is exactly compensated by the continuous creation of matter. According to this idea, the mean density of matter in the cosmos remains constant; the Universe has no beginning, no end and no age. Bondi's motivation came in part from observational difficulties then besetting the rival Big Bang cosmology (to use Hoyle's intentionally pejorative term), but also from his conviction that an acceptable cosmology must satisfy Mach's principle, which relates local inertial effects to the global properties of the cosmos. His philosophy of science was strongly influenced by Karl Popper. He favoured steady-state cosmology because it was \u2018vulnerable\u2019 \u2014 it made precise predictions that were falsifiable, in Popper's sense of the word. This puritanical stance was tempered by his appreciation that incontrovertible observational facts were often hard to find. Thus he pointed out that the mass of Capella, used by Eddington to calibrate his stellar mass\u2013luminosity relation, had since been revised. Equally, one \u2018fact\u2019 that cast doubt on evolutionary cosmology \u2014 the ages of the oldest stars apparently exceeded the estimated age of the Universe \u2014 disappeared in 1952 with Walter Baade's doubling of the cosmic distance scale. Bondi remained true to Popper, and gave up the steady-state hypothesis in the face of increasing conflicting observational evidence, such as the discovery in 1965 of the cosmic microwave background radiation, which the steady-state hypothesis could not easily explain. He showed little interest in the subsequent revised versions proposed by Hoyle and his collaborators. Bondi's legacy in this area is his superbly written monograph  Cosmology , and a series of papers on general relativity, especially on gravitational radiation. The list of concepts that bear his name shows his influence: the Bondi news function, the Bondi mass, Bondi waves, the Bondi\u2013Metzner\u2013Sachs group and the Tolman\u2013Bondi universe. From 1951, Bondi's academic career continued at King's College London, and culminated in his election in 1983 as master of Churchill College, Cambridge. But he also began a parallel life as a high-level public servant, becoming director-general of the forerunner of the European Space Agency, the Paris-based European Space Research Organization, in 1967. In a subsequent wide-ranging career in Britain that was testament to both his intellectual and his organizational abilities, he was successively chief scientific adviser to the Ministry of Defence, chief scientist to the Department of Energy, where he laid the groundwork for Britain's first long-term energy policy, and chairman of the Natural Environment Research Council. One of his greatest achievements was his report written after the 1953 floods that devastated parts of eastern England, which ultimately led to the construction of the Thames Barrier to protect London from storm surges. Bondi believed strongly in the social responsibility of scientists, and so was active in the Pugwash movement and the scientific education of the public. From 1982 to 1999 he was president of the British Humanist Association. Although he could be ruthless when confronted with flawed arguments, whatever their source, he respected the intellectually honest opponent working from different axioms. He will be much missed, as both a public servant and a private man. Reprints and Permissions"},

The closing words of Joseph Rotblat's lecture on acceptance of the 1995 Nobel Peace Prize sum up his nature. \u201cThe quest for a war-free world has a basic purpose: survival. But if in the process we learn how to achieve it by love rather than by fear, by kindness rather than by compulsion; if in the process we learn to combine the essential with the enjoyable, the expedient with the benevolent, the practical with the beautiful, this will be an extra incentive to embark on this great task. Above all, remember your humanity.\u201d Joseph Rotblat died on 31 August, aged 96. Rotblat was born in Warsaw on 4 November 1908 into a middle-class Jewish family. The family was left impoverished by the First World War: at the age of 15, Rotblat worked as an electrician during the day and studied physics in the evening. He won an open scholarship to the Free University of Poland, later obtaining a doctorate from the University of Warsaw with research on the inelastic scattering of neutrons. It was while working in the radiological laboratory of the Scientific Society of Warsaw that he heard of the discovery of nuclear fission. He then himself showed experimentally that neutrons are emitted in the process, and envisaged a divergent chain reaction with a vast release of energy. This, he realized, could result in an explosion of unprecedented power. Rotblat moved to England in 1939 to work under James Chadwick in Liverpool, first on the university's new cyclotron particle accelerator, and then on the feasibility of the atomic bomb. In Poland he had married a student of literature, Tola Gryn, and he returned to Warsaw to fetch her. But she developed appendicitis, and Rotblat had to leave for England again on his own. Before she could follow him, Germany invaded Poland and war began. Despite all his efforts he was unable to get her out. She died during the war without his seeing her again. In 1943, Rotblat followed Chadwick to Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico, to work on the Manhattan Project that developed the atomic bomb. The project's morality disquieted him, but he feared that the Germans would develop the bomb first, and believed the Allies must be able to threaten retaliation. When intelligence showed that German progress was minimal, he resigned from the Manhattan Project on grounds of conscience and returned to Liverpool. After the war he took British citizenship, deciding not to return to communist Poland. The bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945 appalled Rotblat, and his life's mission began. He worked at first through the Atomic Scientists Association to educate the public about nuclear matters, and campaigned for the international control of nuclear energy. He switched his research to the medical applications of nuclear physics and joined the staff of St Bartholomew's Hospital Medical College at the University of London in 1949, becoming professor of physics in 1950. There he explored the use of linear accelerators for radiotherapy, and produced several landmark studies with Patricia Lindop on the effects of high-energy radiation on living tissue. But it was an American bomb test in 1954, which showered a Japanese fishing boat with radioactive fallout, that made Rotblat an international figure. He calculated that the bomb had been vastly more \u2018dirty\u2019 than the public had been told. His move to bring this matter into the open horrified government circles, which considered that all nuclear matters should be secret. Around this time Rotblat met Bertrand Russell, who also was becoming increasingly concerned about the hydrogen bomb. In 1955 Rotblat was one of 11 prominent signatories of the Russell\u2013Einstein Manifesto, a stark statement of the dangers of nuclear war. The manifesto led to the initial Pugwash Conference in 1957, in the village of Pugwash on the northern shore of Nova Scotia, at which scientists from across the world gathered to discuss how to avert a nuclear catastrophe. It was the first of more than 300 international conferences and workshops, in which participants speak as individuals whose remarks are unattributable. Throughout his life, Rotblat was a driving force in the Pugwash organization, becoming its secretary-general (1957\u201373), president (1988\u201397) and emeritus president. Since its inception, Pugwash has been one of the foremost advocates of d\u00e9tente and disarmament in the nuclear age. It kept lines of communication open during the cold war and helped lay the foundation for important arms-control treaties. It provided the first links between Henry Kissinger and the North Vietnamese in the Vietnam war, and was an informal channel for officials and public figures in the Arab\u2013Israeli, Korean and Kashmiri conflicts. In 1995, the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded jointly to Pugwash and to Joseph Rotblat. But Rotblat's pacifist activities extended beyond Pugwash. He co-founded the UK Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament and was the initiator of the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. He participated in the Medical Exchange Programme between Britain and the Soviet Union, and was largely responsible for the comprehensive reports of the World Health Organization of 1984 and 1987 on the effects of nuclear war on health and health services. Shortly before his death, Rotblat had become increasingly concerned about developments in nuclear policy, particularly in the United States. He contacted leaders of other non-governmental organizations to initiate the Weapons of Mass Destruction Awareness Programme, launched in London in 2004 by himself and the former Soviet president Mikhail Gorbachev. In addition to numerous papers on nuclear physics and radiation biology, Rotblat wrote, or co-wrote, more than 40 books on various aspects of the control of nuclear weapons and the prevention of war. Alongside the Nobel prize, he received the Bertrand Russell Society Award in 1983 and the Albert Einstein Peace Prize in 1992. Among British honours, he was appointed a Commander of the British Empire in 1965, and knighted in 1998. Rotblat was a towering figure in the struggle for peace. He was brilliant, energetic, determined and eloquent: a man of utter integrity and great humanity, who committed his life to the pursuit of a saner, safer world. In his autobiography, Bertrand Russell said of Rotblat's work for disarmament: \u201cIf ever these evils are eradicated, his name should stand very high indeed among the heroes.\u201d Reprints and Permissions"},

It is a commonplace phenomenon that often surprises, and sometimes delights (see picture). But what happens when the nozzle is very small? And what kind of nozzle produces the smallest droplets? P. McGuinness and colleagues applied themselves to these questions ( J. Phys. D   38,  3382\u20133386; 2005 ). Their motivation was by no means a frivolous one: the answers are crucial to improving the resolution of inkjet printing, as well as being more generally applicable to industrial techniques requiring the manipulation of small liquid samples. In such cases, the high surface tension that develops at nozzles of micrometre diameters could limit the scope for reducing droplet size. So the authors tested different sizes and shapes of small nozzles, using numerical techniques based on the Young\u2013Laplace equation, which relates the pressure difference at a gas\u2013liquid interface to its geometry. For two-dimensional (planar) nozzles, a triangular opening with sides curved slightly inwards proved the best choice: compared with a conventional, circular opening at the same pressure, it provided a 16% reduction in droplet volume. But the authors didn't stop there. By bending the corners of the curvilinear triangle up or down to form a non-planar nozzle tip, they were able to bring the reduction in volume to around 33%. As they point out, this adds another dimension to questions of small-droplet generation. Reprints and Permissions"},

A complex and beautiful crystalline germanate structure widens the scope of such materials. The discovery of ordered mesoporous materials 1 , 2  has had an enormous impact on materials research. Such materials have influenced work on gels, surfactants, composite materials, nanomaterials and zeolites (catalytic and adsorbent materials familiar as, for example, water-softeners). Self-organization, surface (\u2018heterogeneous\u2019) catalysis and separation technologies have also felt their effects. Writing on  page 716  of this issue, Zou  et al . 3  introduce a mesoporous germanium oxide (germanate) material possessing exciting structural properties that could spur further investigations. Mesoporous materials are three-dimensional bonded atomic networks punctuated by regular nanoscale holes, or pores. (The name \u2018mesoporous\u2019 reflects the size of the holes: materials with significantly smaller pore diameters are known as microporous, those with larger pores as macroporous.) Such materials are generally formed by the action of a negatively charged (anionic) species that include multiple oxygen-containing groups \u2014 a silicate, phosphate or aluminate, for example \u2014 on a template of a self-assembled organic molecule such as a surfactant. The ionic species match up their charges with those on the surface of the template and so attach themselves to it. The resulting rigid, periodic framework remains stable even when the organic template molecules are burnt away in a process known as calcination, creating a structure possessing pore sizes of 3\u2013500 nanometres. Mesoporous silicates formed in this way were originally thought to be similar in structure and function to crystalline zeolites possessing smaller pores. This would point to applications in catalysis, separation and sorption technologies \u2014 species of high molecular weight could also be used, as these could enter the larger pore spaces and undergo chemical transformations there 4 . But it turns out that using self-assembled surfactant molecules as templates produces amorphous inorganic frameworks: although the structure has mesoscopic order, leading to a characteristic diffraction pattern, atomic-level periodicity in the glass-like silicate framework is lost. This amorphous pore-wall forfeits the shape-selective properties characteristic of zeolites and important for catalysis, acting instead like slightly curved amorphous silica. This is the remarkable aspect of Zou and colleagues' material 3 : the germanium oxide they describe is both mesoporous and crystalline ( Fig. 1 ). It also has the largest cell volume of any inorganic substance, with an accessible pore space that is more than 50% of the total volume. The walls of the structure's pores are formed of germanate clusters with the chemical formula Ge 10 O 24 (OH) 3 . These are linked through Ge\u2013O\u2013Ge bonds and line a so-called G-minimal surface 5 , 6  consisting of a complex series of concave and convex faces with cubic symmetry. (A minimal surface is one that minimizes its surface area \u2014 equivalent to its surface energy \u2014 for specified boundary conditions, rather like a film of soap in a wire frame used for blowing bubbles.) As the surface of the crystalline walls is significantly curved, the structure contains potential reactive centres that are absent in mesoporous materials lacking crystalline order. This framework fulfils the basic requirement for catalytic activity; its full scope, however, will only become apparent when the germanium sites are replaced by other metal cations. The periodic G-minimal surface separates a set of two interpenetrating, three-dimensional channel systems that are chiral \u2014 that is, non-superimposable mirror images of each other. The interface of these two systems might form the site for stereoselective reactions that produce molecules of a particular spatial configuration. Zou and colleagues also varied 3  their synthesis procedure to obtain a material that is chiral overall by blocking off one channel system with a pore filler, leaving the other channel \u2018active\u2019. Further work must show whether it is possible to obtain one pure chiral form, and whether the chiral character of the pore can be used in heterogeneous catalysis. The mesoporous germanate is surprisingly thermally stable, its properties and structure being little affected by heat. The hydroxyl groups that become accessible in its calcined form might also be modified by ion exchange or the introduction of reactive centres into the mesoporous space, providing extra opportunities for catalysis. The smaller pore spaces in crystalline zeolites, and the instability of other ordered mesoporous materials, have until now hampered the successful application of this concept. This potential advance is indicative of a wealth of explorative lines of research using Zou and colleagues' material; time will tell whether all predictions made for its use hold. The authors have since announced the synthesis of a further crystalline mesoporous germanate, indicating a more general chemical principle behind their findings. In their first structure, the pore geometry is similar to cubic mesoporous structures of a class known as MCM-48, which also have a periodic G-minimal surface. The second material, in contrast, has the pore topology of MCM-41-type material, with a cylindrical minimal surface arranged in a honeycomb pattern. Zou and colleagues do not speculate on the nature of the physical or chemical mechanisms that allow germanates to yield such highly complex crystal structures. One explanation might be the structure of the Ge 10 O 24 (OH) 3  anion, with its core of three [GeO 6 ] octahedra linked along their edges, shielded by a shell of seven [GeO 4 ] tetrahedra linked at their corners. The highly ionic character of the octahedral bond leaves enough flexibility to link subunits, whereas the more directed bond of the tetrahedral units provides the strength and rigidity required to maintain the porous framework, even after calcination. Unusually, therefore, it is the properties of the building blocks of the pore wall that are central to the formation of Zou and colleagues' germanates. No true templating is required from the template \u2014 just space-filling and charge-matching. It will be interesting to see what other building blocks, and which other polyoxo-metallate anions, can be used to construct further such materials. Reprints and Permissions"},

Appl. Ecol.  doi:10.1111/j.1365-2664.2005.01117.x ). Many animals have beautiful spot patterns that differ subtly between individuals of the same species. Photographs of these markings allow ecologists to identify individuals in population studies, but sifting through them is laborious and often unreliable when done by eye. The aim of the authors \u2014 an astronomer, a computer scientist and a marine biologist \u2014 was to automate the process. The whale shark ( Rhincodon typus , pictured) is the world's largest fish, reaching lengths of more than 14 metres, and bears patterns of white spots on its dark dorsal surface. The leap forwards made by Arzoumanian  et al . was to view these patterns as celestial constellations. They adapted an algorithm for identifying characteristic stellar patterns from the geometric properties of triangles made by the lines formed between all possible combinations of three-spot coordinates within a defined region of space. In the same way, by concentrating on a highly variable region of spots above the pectoral fin of whale sharks, the spatial relationships between spots formed the basis for identifying a shark's unique spot pattern. The modified algorithm was used to calculate similarity scores by comparing the geometry of each spot triangle in a shark photograph with all spot-triangle combinations from a second image. This procedure was repeated between all image-pair combinations to locate high-scoring matches. The researchers then tested the technique by scanning a web-based database of around 1,500 whale shark photographs, and achieved a 92% success rate in matching previously identified pairs of images of individual sharks, as well as resolving new matches not detected by eye. The approach should improve our understanding of whale shark population dynamics, about which little is known. More information is needed urgently, as increasing exploitation of whale sharks means their populations are now vulnerable. Many animal species have star-quality skin patterns, and the study shows how individual animals can be \u2018tagged\u2019 at low cost for long periods, and without physical interference. Linking the pattern-matching algorithm to a web-based photo-identification database, so that it performs like an Internet search engine, will allow researchers around the world to compare new images with vast numbers of virtually tagged animals.

Examination of a 2,000-year record of tsunami deposits in the region clarifies matters. In May 1960, south-central Chile experienced a huge earthquake, the largest since instrument records began. The consequences were felt not only in Chile, but also in Hawaii, the Philippines, Japan and other locations across the Pacific, which were all hit by the ensuing tsunami. But this giant seismic event has long puzzled seismologists, because the energy released by the earthquake should have taken several centuries to build up, through the accumulation of stress on the fault concerned, as the Nazca and South American tectonic plates converge at a rate of 8\u20139 centimetres per year. Yet the immediately preceding events are historically documented as occurring not only in 1575, which would fit expectations, but also in 1737 and 1837. As they describe on page 404 of this issue 1 , Cisternas  et al.  have revisited this puzzle by examining records of land movement and tsunamis left in buried layers of sand and soil in an estuary that runs across the central part of the fault zone (see  Fig. 1  of the paper,  page 404 ). With these records, and earlier ones ( Fig. 1 ), the history of activity on this fault can be rewritten. Since the inception of instrumental recording in the late 1800s, the largest earthquakes have all occurred in subduction zones 2 , where one tectonic plate is being driven beneath another. These earthquakes involve ruptures on the order of a thousand kilometres long by a couple of hundred kilometres wide, with fault displacements of tens of metres. Hundreds of years are necessary to accumulate the stresses released in these giant events, which leave traces of their consequences that can later be identified. Thanks to the work of Cisternas  et al . 1 , we now have more insight into the seismic cycle in south-central Chile. The earthquake of May 1960 resulted from a rupture, about 1,000 km long and 150 km wide, along the north\u2013south-trending fault where the Nazca plate dives beneath South America. Earthquakes of this size saturate the recorders of the seismic waves that are usually used to estimate earthquake magnitude and which are reported in terms of the familiar Richter scale. Instead, a measure known as seismic moment is used 3 . This is now more commonly applied to seismic events in general, and is calculated by multiplying the area of the rupture zone by the fault displacement and a quantity reflecting the rigidity of the volume in which the rupture takes place. The moment magnitude, derived from this quantity, reflects the real size in terms of the elastic energy release of an earthquake. The 1960 earthquake measured 9.5 on the moment-magnitude scale. It has a special place in seismological history, because it provided experimental confirmation of the idea that earthquakes can cause free oscillations of the Earth 4  \u2014 that is, set the Earth ringing. The observed changes in land elevation ranged from 6 m of uplift to 2 m of subsidence; these displacements have been modelled 5 , 6  as the elastic response of the Earth to an average dislocation of 20 m along the fault, with localized peaks of more than 30 m. Even now, in 2005, post-seismic readjustments continue to be observed in the area 7 . Cisternas  et al . 1  undertook a detailed examination of a local stratigraphic record of earthquakes in south-central Chile, as produced by the associated tsunamis and seen in layers of intercalated sand and soil extending horizontally for nearly a kilometre close to the mouth of the R\u00edo Maull\u00edn. This region subsided approximately 2 m as a consequence of the 1960 event, but the stratigraphy has been preserved because of long-term net tectonic uplift. Overall, the authors were able to identify a sequence of eight large earthquakes that have occurred over the past 2,000 years, with an average recurrence interval of about 300 years. But what about the apparent recurrence sequence of 1575, 1737, 1837 and 1960, which does not fit this pattern? The consequences of the 1575 event are evident both from carbon dating and in documents written by the Spanish conquistadors, which tell of effects that were similar to those seen in 1960. Documentation of the earthquakes of 1737 and 1837 is less clear, but they are frequently cited in the seismological histories of the region as being large (estimated magnitudes of 7.5 and 8.0, respectively) 8 . Cisternas  et al ., however, find that although the 1575 earthquake appears clearly in their tsunami stratigraphic record, those of 1737 and 1837 do not. A tsunami was associated with the event of 1837, reaching Hawaii with an amplitude of 6 m. But Cisternas  et al . suggest that it originated outside their study area, to the south, and they conclude that the earthquake of 1737 was too small to generate a sizeable tsunami. All in all, they propose that much of the fault dislocation that occurred in 1960 stemmed from a release of energy that had remained \u2018locked in\u2019 since 1575 \u2014 that is, the earthquakes that occurred between those times had expended comparatively little of the accumulated stress. The relevance of these studies is underlined by the more recent occurrence of a huge earthquake elsewhere in the world. In December 2004, and again in March 2005, the eastern Indian Ocean was seriously affected by tectonic movement at a subduction zone. The giant December event stemmed from a displacement of up to 30 m along a rupture 1,100 km in length 9 , which produced the devastating tsunami that swept across the Indian Ocean \u2014 a startling reminder of the need to learn more about the behaviour of giant earthquakes.

The authors observed that if salt is added to polymer spheres dispersed in an organic solvent mixture, the charge on the spheres can be controlled and the electrostatic interactions between them can be regulated. This enabled the preparation of binary mixtures of colloids that carried small, opposite charges and readily formed ionic crystals. When an electric field was applied, the crystal melted, and particles of opposite charge moved towards opposite electrodes. The charged colloidal particles therefore clearly resemble ionic species. But there are differences. In particular, a diffuse layer of \u2018counter-ions\u2019 surrounds each particle, forming an overall charge-neutral unit that participates in the growth of the crystal. So the structure of the colloidal crystals is not dictated by charge neutrality, as in atomic systems, leaving the authors free to create remarkable new binary structures. One example, a crystal comprising particles of positive (green, radius 0.36 \u03bcm) and negative (red, radius 1.16 \u03bcm) charge in the ratio 6:1, is shown in the image. Colloidal crystals can also form from charged spheres made of different materials, such as a polymer and silica. It is then straightforward to burn the polymer spheres away to give all-silica structures. Given the ease with which these structures grow into large crystals, ionic colloids should prove an alluring proposition for those creating advanced materials such as photonic crystals.

After completing his PhD, in 1953 he moved to the California Institute of Technology, and became interested in the problem of measuring levels of CO 2  in the atmosphere. Before that time, the prospect that levels of atmospheric CO 2  could be altered on a global scale because of the burning of coal, gas and oil was largely theoretical. At the end of the nineteenth century, Svante Arrhenius and Arvid H\u00f6gbom had suggested that temperature might be affected by greenhouse gases. But the possibility of increasing atmospheric CO 2  was of no concern because the ocean was believed to absorb most of any increase. In the 1950s, however, Roger Revelle and Hans Suess at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in California realized that the sink capacity of the ocean is limited because of the slow mixing with deeper waters. Measurement of atmospheric CO 2  thus became a compelling topic of scientific interest. A job offer from Revelle brought Keeling to Scripps, where he remained for his entire career. Keeling looked for alternatives to the existing, questionable methods of determining variations in CO 2 , and eventually resorted to using an infrared analyser. As this is a relative measurement, he had to devise a clever system of calibration to make the measurements accurate and comparable between different sites and over long time spans. In conjunction with the International Geophysical Year 1957, a series of global geophysical activities spanning 1957\u201358, systems were set up on Mauna Loa and in Antarctica, supplemented by lab measurements on air flasks regularly sampled at the South Pole. The choice of such remote places was to ensure that they were as far away from local sources of CO 2  as possible, thus allowing reliable detection of changes in the background atmosphere. Only two years later, Keeling produced a classic paper showing that the atmospheric CO 2  concentration was rising at the South Pole at a rate consistent with estimates of fossil-fuel emissions and ocean uptake. He also showed that the concentration at Mauna Loa exhibits a characteristic seasonal variation. Using concurrent measurements of the  13 C/ 12 C isotope ratio in CO 2 , which differs according to the exchange processes with the land and the ocean, Keeling was able to demonstrate that this seasonal variation is probably driven by the annual cycle of vegetation in the northern extratropics. Many would have left it at that and moved on to other scientific investigations. Keeling, however, anticipated the power of long-term observations and, despite many funding crises, relentlessly pursued the measurements. Thanks to this work, we now have two highly accurate records of atmospheric CO 2  spanning almost half a century; between the late 1950s and today, levels of CO 2  have risen from about 315 parts per million to more than 375 parts per million. The information content in these long records is truly amazing. Keeling and his co-workers showed that the changes in total atmospheric CO 2  content can be estimated quite accurately. And by combining this with estimates of fossil-fuel emissions, we can tell how much CO 2  is being absorbed jointly by the ocean and terrestrial biosphere. Close analysis of the seasonal cycle in CO 2  concentrations at Mauna Loa revealed an increase in amplitude of up to 20% over the 40 years, indicating a strengthening \u2018breathing\u2019 of the vegetation in the Northern Hemisphere. The records also show interannual variations, which can be related to climate fluctuations such as those of the El Ni\u00f1o\u2013Southern Oscillation. And using concurrent  13 C/ 12 C isotope measurements, Keeling's group could estimate the relative contributions of land and ocean to these phenomena. The records from Mauna Loa and the South Pole were soon complemented by measurements made elsewhere to produce a global picture of CO 2  distribution. Keeling was aware that these data could be used with a model of atmospheric transport to determine the regional patterns of CO 2  sources and sinks. During a sabbatical stay in Stockholm in the early 1960s, he and the meteorologist Bert Bolin performed the first such \u2018inversion\u2019 of atmospheric CO 2  measurements and demonstrated that fossil-fuel emissions indeed contribute significantly to the global distribution of the gas. As increasing numbers of atmospheric monitoring stations became established by other groups, this pioneering work was refined with better numerical models. Today it constitutes a key method for monitoring the carbon cycle on larger scales. Keeling was not always an easy colleague to work with. He was meticulous and demanded the same standards from his co-workers. But it is thanks to this attention to detail that we now have such beautiful documents depicting the changes in atmospheric composition. His work was recognized by numerous awards, such as the Blue Planet Prize from the Science Council of Japan and the Tyler Prize for Environmental Achievement. Outside science, Keeling led an active life. Supported by his lovely family, he was involved in the political life of his home town; he also conducted a choir, and after a hard day at work he enjoyed playing the grand piano (and did so with considerable proficiency). He took great interest in foreign cultures \u2014 I fondly remember how, during a sabbatical stay in Switzerland, he even took on the challenge of taking lessons in the Bernese Swiss\u2013German language with considerable success. But his major love was nature, and especially the mountains. Keeling died on 20 June. Appropriately, his final resting place is near his summer house in the wilderness of Montana.

It seems they can be wrapped up in membrane packages instead. On  page 422  of this issue, Mashburn and Whiteley 1  describe the unexpected convergence of two seemingly unrelated areas of microbiological research: how bacteria talk to their friends, and how they attack their enemies. The authors studied the bacterial pathogen  Pseudomonas aeruginosa , which releases a hydrophobic molecule called the \u2018pseudomonas quinolone signal\u2019 (PQS) to send messages to other bacteria of the same species. The surprise is that, rather than being secreted as single molecules, PQS is released in bubble-like \u2018vesicles\u2019 that also contain antibacterial agents and probably toxins aimed at host tissue cells as well.\n Various groups of bacteria use diffusible chemicals to signal to their own kind, and this method of communication seems to have evolved independently several times 2 .  Pseudomonas aeruginosa  is a Gram-negative proteobacterium and, like many proteobacteria, it secretes molecules called acylhomoserine lactones (AHLs). The concentration of these signal molecules increases with cell population density, enabling the bacteria to sense how many of their kind surround them \u2014 a phenomenon known as quorum sensing. Whole sets of genes are switched on only at high cell densities, including genes for bioluminescence, DNA transfer, pigment production, and genes required for infecting plants, animals and humans 2 . But AHL molecules are readily broken down by other bacteria, and some AHL signals are poorly soluble in water, so they cannot travel far in an aqueous environment \u2014 both factors that would seem to limit their potential as communication signals. PQS, although not an AHL-type signal, is also poorly water-soluble and readily broken down by other bacteria. So how do these molecules manage to spread the word from one bacterium to another? Mashburn and Whiteley found clues from another bacterial communication system \u2014 one aimed at enemies rather than friends. Many Gram-negative bacteria release minute vesicles (about 50 nm in diameter) 3  from their outer membranes as a means of delivering toxins to host cells and other bacteria (sometimes referred to type VI protein export 4 ). The vesicles consist of a lipid bilayer surrounding an aqueous core and they can therefore transport lipid-soluble toxins (lipopolysaccharide endotoxin) on their surface and protein toxins in their core. They release their poisonous cargo by fusing with the lipid bilayer of target cells. Mashburn and Whiteley show that these vesicles can also release the PQS signal to other bacteria, thereby sidestepping the problems of poor water-solubility and degradation. Remarkably,  P. aeruginosa  has three quorum-sensing systems that use AHL signals. Apart from the PQS system, there is the LasR/LasI system, which signals using 3-oxo-dodecanoylhomoserine lactone (OdDHL), and the RhlR/RhlI system, which uses butyryl-homoserine lactone (BHL). Of these three signals, OdDHL and PQS are poorly water-soluble, and all three can be degraded by other bacteria. Mashburn and Whiteley found that PQS (but not OdDHL or BHL) is not dispersed between bacteria as single, water-soluble molecules, but rather is concentrated within membrane vesicles, presumably buried within the lipid bilayer. PQS is one of at least 55 quinolones and quinolines made by  P. aeruginosa , some of which have potent antibacterial activity. The membrane vesicles, in addition to signalling to kindred  P. aeruginosa  cells, showed potent antibacterial activity against the Gram-positive bacterium  Staphylococcus aureus . Most of the antimicrobial activity could be extracted by organic solvents, indicating that toxicity was due to quinolines rather than to the protein component of the vesicles. The production of the vesicles seems to be regulated by PQS, because when PQS synthesis was abolished by a mutation in the  pqsH  gene, vesicle production virtually ceased. Addition of extra PQS restored vesicle formation, even if protein synthesis was blocked by an antibiotic. So, whatever PQS is doing, it is probably happening at the post-translational level, rather than causing alterations in gene expression. Most of the added PQS was found in vesicles, which also contained other quinolones possessing antimicrobial activity. It seems that when PQS is inserted into the outer membrane \u2014 whether it was made by that bacterium or added from another source \u2014 it can destabilize the membrane and spontaneously form vesicles containing itself, other quinolones and presumably endotoxin and periplasmic proteins. These vesicles can then signal to other pseudomonads, kill unrelated bacteria, and deliver toxic lipopolysaccharides and proteins to host cells. Pseudomonas aeruginosa  is an opportunistic human pathogen that is a particular problem in the lungs of cystic fibrosis patients. Greater understanding about how these bacteria communicate with each other and attack host cells could lead to novel treatment strategies for  P. aeruginosa  infections. The way in which other bacteria generate these ubiquitous membrane vesicles, and what they might contain, is unknown, but most proteobacteria do not synthesize PQS, so other mechanisms must be involved. Moreover, hydrophobic long-chain AHLs were not found in membrane vesicles in this study, so how these signalling molecules diffuse or are transported between bacteria has still to be discovered.

One answer to this frequently asked question might be found by a sensor that uses an array of chemically sensitive dyes to identify organic compounds dissolved in water. The innovative array developed by Chen Zhang and Kenneth S. Suslick (see  J. Am. Chem. Soc.  doi:10.1021/ja052606z; 2005) uses 36 dots of dyes that change colour in response to pH, molecular polarity and Lewis basicity (how readily a molecule donates an electron pair). These properties are strongly influenced by water, making it tricky to identify trace molecules in solution. So Zhang and Suslick dampen the effects of water by using hydrophobic dyes on a hydrophobic membrane. The combination of colour changes in the dye dots when they are dunked in solution forms a 'fingerprint' of the compounds present. The authors confirm this using a variety of common organic molecules at concentrations as low as one micromol per litre. And, although a breakdown of components is not possible with the array, complex mixtures of organic molecules do excite a unique response \u2014 as the authors show by testing a number of similar aqueous solutions found in their refrigerators (see images). Zhang and Suslick concede that the recognition of flavours is still some way off. That would require the incorporation into the array of hydrophobic dyes that are sensitive to salt or sugar, for instance.

Steinhardt"}], "parsed_as_year": "2006_or_before", "body": "In Duchenne muscular dystrophy, muscle cells die as a result of suffering many tiny membrane ruptures. A compound that increases membrane resealing can protect heart muscle cells from these effects. Degenerative muscle diseases are usually the result of defects in the cytoskeleton, the cell's internal scaffolding. This structure normally shields muscle cells from mechanical stress, protecting their membranes from tearing. People with Duchenne muscular dystrophy lack the protein dystrophin, which is an essential link in the complex of proteins that connect the cytoskeleton in the cell to a matrix of extracellular proteins. These buttresses across the membrane protect it from mechanical stress. Consequently, Duchenne dystrophic cells tend to get more rips in their membranes than do normal muscle cells. In this issue, Yasuda  et al . ( page 1025 ) 1  show that the addition of a chemical that aids membrane resealing can preserve dystrophic heart muscle cells from such damage, and might help to maintain heart function  in vivo . Small rips in muscle cell membranes are normal, because these cells are under continuous mechanical stress. But in dystrophic muscle cells the frequency of these microdisruptions is greatly increased because their cytoskeleton cannot shield the membrane as effectively. Both normal and Duchenne dystrophic muscle cells can repair these tiny ruptures quickly, but not before calcium ions have flooded into the cell. This causes an increased calcium-dependent breakdown of proteins, which in turn results in a persistent calcium influx in the vicinity of the resealed wound. Over time there is a gradual loss of calcium homeostasis, further activation of protein degradation, and eventual cell death 2 . As the dystrophic cells suffer many more rips than normal cells, cell death occurs more quickly. Studies of Duchenne dystrophic cells have tended to concentrate on skeletal muscle rather than heart muscle, which under certain circumstances can be physiologically quite different. However, at least 15% of Duchenne sufferers die from heart failure. Yasuda  et al . 1  have now analysed dystrophic heart tissue, and they confirm that individual dystrophic heart muscle cells also show more stretch-mediated damage to their membrane than do normal cells. Just as in skeletal muscle cells, this is followed by loss of normal calcium homeostasis and cell death. The authors next examined the effect of a surfactant called poloxamer 188 (also known as Pluronic F68) on the dystrophic cells. This compound has been used in cell culture since the early 1960s to minimize mechanical damage from aeration and stirring of cell suspensions 3 . It is now clear that poloxamer 188 acts by helping to seal up tears in the cell membrane. Cell membranes are under considerable tension from their attachment to the cytoskeleton, and this tension is sufficient to prevent passive resealing of rips in the lipid bilayer. Instead, an active process called exocytosis adds membrane by fusion with small membrane-bounded vesicles from within the cell to lower the membrane tension and close the break 4 , 5 . Poloxamer 188 greatly accelerates resealing, even in the absence of exocytosis 6  \u2014 apparently by lowering the tension from cytoskeletal attachments at the membrane 5 , 6 . This compound can insert directly into lipid monolayers 7 , and a similar process probably underlies its capacity to lower the tension in the bilayer lipid membrane. Yasuda  et al . 1  found that adding poloxamer 188 to dystrophic cardiac cells in culture mitigates any stress-induced injuries to the membrane. To test whether the effect is significant  in vivo , they used a mouse model of muscular dystrophy, subjecting the mice to a chemical-stress protocol that would usually cause heart failure. Strikingly, injecting poloxamer 188 into the mice before the start of the stress protocol blocked the heart failure. So membrane fragility, membrane disruption and the resulting abnormal calcium homeostasis found in dystrophic cardiac muscle can be corrected by an agent that rapidly reseals cell membranes. The authors propose that these results will have therapeutic implications for the treatment of muscular dystrophies. A note of caution should be raised, however. Yasuda  et al . demonstrate clear beneficial effects of adding poloxamer 188 to dystrophic heart muscle in the concentration range 0.5\u20131.25 mg per ml. But it is already known that the highest, most effective concentration is not well tolerated by healthy human volunteers given the compound for more than 44 hours 8 . The lowest dose, which is tolerated for up to 72 hours in humans, may well have serious consequences if taken continuously over a lifetime. Lifelong treatment would be necessary because poloxamer 188 is useful only if it is present before the break in the membrane occurs. Only then can it speed the resealing of cell membrane, bypassing the normal process 6 . Nevertheless, although poloxamer 188 is not ready as a therapy for lifelong conditions, the results of Yasuda and colleagues do imply that further research on membrane sealants could be very useful, especially if harmful side effects could be avoided, or if brief treatment periods were found to be of lasting benefit. There is another application, however, which might be of immediate benefit to all. Major surgery carries with it a significant risk of oxygen deprivation that can lead to damage to the patient's heart or brain, and death. It has been known for some time that using an agent that artificially reseals the membranes of oxygen-deprived heart cells will prevent cell death for at least 24 hours after oxygen withdrawal 9 . That study 9  used targeted liposomes (artificial lipid vesicles) to reseal the membranes, which is not practical as a medical procedure. But, given that damaged cells are very rapidly resealed in the presence of poloxamer 188 (ref.  6 ), and that this occurs  in vivo 1 , perhaps poloxamer 188 should be administered during high-risk surgery, at effective doses that are tolerated for 24 hours. The savings in terms of lives and the use of critical hospital resources might well be significant. Reprints and Permissions"},

There are doubtless sufficient reasons for these omissions: many writers of papers undertake the research they describe for no other reason that that their supervisors \u2018put them on to it\u2019, and many editors of journals consider contemplation out of place in science and do not encourage authors to indulge in it...How refreshing it is, for example, to hear that the choice of a subject for research involves the \u201cart of rejection\u201d, and to be told that this art can be compared with the art of the Chinese in designing the empty spaces in their pictures. It is refreshing, too, to be reminded...that the very observations one makes, and  a fortiori , one's interpretation of them, are limited by the Zeitgeist and by unconscious philosophical assumptions derived from Spinoza.

Every race is resistant to every disease strictly in proportion to its past experience of it...These facts appear to establish conclusively two truths, first that evolution is due solely to natural selection, and second that variations, except, perhaps, in rare instance, are not due to the direct action of the environment on the germ-plasm, but are \u201cspontaneous.\u201d The Lamarckian doctrine is quite out of court.

Hoffmann"}], "parsed_as_year": "2006_or_before", "body": "Infection of mosquitoes by a particular bacterium has a fiendishly complicated influence on the success or failure of mosquito breeding. A window now opens on the molecular basis of this \u2018cytoplasmic incompatibility\u2019. Cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI) is a well-known phenomenon in many insects and mites 1 . It occurs when an agent inherited in the cell cytoplasm causes matings between strains of the same species to yield few or no offspring, and it is usually associated with infections of a bacterium known as  Wolbachia . The bacterium lives inside the reproductive cells of its host, and was first associated with CI in a mosquito,  Culex pipiens , when it was discovered that treating different strains of this species with an antibiotic restored compatibility between them. However, there are complex patterns of cross-compatibility between strains of  C. pipiens  from different populations 2 , and these have never been explained. On  page 257  of this issue, Sinkins  et al . 3  describe how they have used information from  Wolbachia  genome-sequencing projects to link this complexity to genes encoding specific protein motifs \u2014 members of the ankyrin family. This research opens up opportunities for understanding both the biological basis of CI and the potential for enlisting  Wolbachia  for mosquito control. In its simplest form, CI is unidirectional \u2014 that is, with two strains of individuals involved in incompatibility, characterized by being either infected or uninfected by a single type of  Wolbachia . Infected females are compatible with uninfected and infected males, but when uninfected females mate with infected males the embryo dies ( Fig. 1 ). Because infected females mate successfully with any male and transmit the infection to all of their offspring, the  Wolbachia  infection should spread and occur at near 100% in populations. These dynamics apply to a  Wolbachia  infection in  C. pipiens  from California 4 . To generate other forms of incompatibility among strains, different types of  Wolbachia  are needed. CI can be bidirectional when strains carry different  Wolbachia  infections. There is incompatibility when males with one type of infection mate with females carrying a different infection, which means that these strains cannot reproduce successfully ( Fig. 1 ). When the same individual carries two different  Wolbachia  infections, complex patterns of incompatibility can occur. Males carrying both infections can show unidirectional CI not only with uninfected females, but also with females carrying only one of the infections. Moreover, strains with only one type of  Wolbachia  can show bidirectional CI. Double infections that act in this manner are found in mosquitoes such as  Aedes albopictus 5 . Although complex patterns of CI occur in crosses between strains of  C. pipiens , attempts to isolate different types of  Wolbachia  from these strains have previously failed, even when using variation in genes known to distinguish  Wolbachia  infections in other insects 6 . Sinkins  et al . 3  have now shown that  C. pipiens  strains that are bidirectionally incompatible differ in two ankyrin-encoding genes. Ankyrins are short, repeated amino-acid motifs thought to mediate interactions among proteins, as well as between proteins and the cytoskeleton, the cellular scaffolding. Genes with ankyrin sequences are particularly common in the  Wolbachia  genome relative to those of other bacteria 7 , making them candidates for the expression of different patterns of CI, especially as they may control the way  Wolbachia  interacts with the cell cycle of its host. Sinkins  et al . found substantial genetic divergence in the two ankyrin-encoding genes of the two  C. pipiens  strains they examined; almost 10% of the nucleotides had diverged for one gene and around 3% for the other. The same genes also differed in another strain that exhibits a different incompatibility pattern. So these genes may be responsible for the varied expression of incompatibility, although the mechanism remains unknown. Further players in events need introducing here. These are bacteriophages, phages for short, which are viruses that infect bacteria and can insert their genomes into that of their host. They enter the story because it turned out that both of the ankyrin-encoding genes are located in regions of the  Wolbachia  genome where phage chromosomes are inserted. Phages can excise from these regions and carry genes located within them to other places in the same genome or different genomes. By using filters to separate the small phage particles from the larger  Wolbachia , Sinkins  et al . 3  found that the two ankyrin-encoding genes could be carried by phage particles independently of the  Wolbachia  genome. This is the first time that putative genes associated with CI expression have been located on phage particles, although it has previously been suspected 8  that phages may be involved in CI. Phage activity, along with the movement of transposable genetic elements, may help to explain the marked changes in the arrangement of ankyrin genes among  Wolbachia  genomes from related hosts 9 . Variation in one such element, known as Tr1, has also been associated with different incompatibility strains of  C. pipiens 10 . Wolbachia  have long been promoted as potential vehicles for transferring deleterious genes into mosquitoes, and other insect populations, for pest control. Among the obstacles to this are the absence of a system for genetically transforming  Wolbachia  and a way of generating new CI types capable of spreading transgenes. If CI genes are located within phage chromosomes, this should help in developing  Wolbachia  infections that can spread deleterious genes. But there remains a danger that changes in the host's nuclear genome will decrease the efficacy of CI as a mechanism to drive transgenes into mosquito populations. Indeed, Sinkins  et al . 3  used backcrosses of two strains of a mosquito species related to  C. pipiens  to show that nuclear genes modified the expression of incompatibility, highlighting the fact that these types of evolutionary changes are possible. So although we are now closer to understanding CI and using  Wolbachia  to introduce transgenes, host genome evolution may yet be a barrier to the aim of using  Wolbachia  for suppressing pest populations.

Richards"}], "parsed_as_year": "2006_or_before", "body": "Seismologist extraordinaire. Everyone called him Kei, the intellectual leader who for 40 years devised new methods to achieve a more quantitative understanding of dynamic processes within the Earth. Kei Aki died on 17 May on R\u00e9union Island, the volcanic \u2018hot spot\u2019 in the Indian Ocean that had been his home since retirement from academic life. He will be known for his many research results in seismology, as well as for his leadership in developing probabilistic estimates of seismic hazard. Aki was born in Japan, and wrote that \u201cWhen I was 19 years old, I applied to the Department of Geophysics of the University of Tokyo, partly because of the simplest entrance examination, only on three subjects, English, Mathematics and Physics\u201d. He moved on to seismology and was recruited by Frank Press to the faculty of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1966, and thus to an academic career in the United States. His scientific achievements include some of the earliest studies using seismic surface waves to estimate fault orientation and direction of slip at the earthquake source. In 1966 he showed how to estimate the \u2018seismic moment\u2019 of an earthquake from seismograms. This measure, equal to the product of fault area ruptured, average fault slip and rigidity, became recognized as the best way to characterize the size of an earthquake source and the strength of its long-period waves. Among many uses of seismic moment are integrative estimates of the earthquake-associated motion between two tectonic plates. When compared with total plate motion derived from geomagnetic, geological and geodetic methods, one learns the fraction of motion on a particular plate boundary that takes place suddenly in earthquakes \u2014 permitting estimates of the long-term seismic hazard. In the 1960s, Aki showed that radiated seismic displacements have a \u2018corner frequency\u2019 below which the spectrum is flat and proportional to seismic moment, and above which it decays as (frequency) \u22122 . He showed that seismic coda (the waves following signal onset) can be used to make stable measurements of source spectra. The following decade, Aki interpreted seismic-wave arrival times at a network of stations to determine the three-dimensional inhomogeneities of Earth structure beneath the network. His \u2018inverse method\u2019 has been applied via instrument deployments on every continent to quantify inhomogeneities in the crust and upper mantle. He also began quantitative studies of fault models that examined the physical features controlling earthquake nucleation, spontaneous rupture, and the eventual stopping of the rupture process on a fault surface because of some barrier or asperity \u2014 or because the rupture has run out of a region of stress concentration. As an observational science, seismology deals with vast ranges of scale. Wavelengths range over a factor of more than 10 8 ; the time windows over which data are analysed range over more than 10 9 ; ground displacements range over more than 10 11 ; and the size of seismic sources ranges over about 10 25 . Consequently seismology is largely conducted as a collection of diverse specialities. Some seismologists interpret signals to map out the remaining commercial deposits in an oilfield; others quantify strong ground-shaking and measure how it decays with distance travelled. Different seismologists study the Earth's internal structure \u2014 from the inner core, up through the mantle, and on up to the shallowest structures in the crust. They identify targets for an archaeological dig, find buried pipelines, measure rates of continental deformation, monitor compliance with nuclear test ban treaties, and assess seismic hazard. Aki and his students worked in many of these specialities, and he himself retained a strong and optimistic interest in arguably the most important of them all, earthquake prediction. In March 1975, he wrote me a letter beginning, \u201cI wonder if you would be interested in coauthoring a text book on theoretical seismology with me...\u201d. It was a surprise, for even then he was a senior figure. I was so junior, and we were not then personally acquainted. I accepted, and will never forget our first meeting. As background to our conversation, he jotted down some apparently random descriptive phrases on a large sheet of paper that soon filled to become the working plan and table of contents for what emerged as  Quantitative Seismology , now translated (with its more than 6,000 equations) into Russian, Chinese and Japanese. His goal was a unified survey that brought out underlying ideas relevant to many different types of seismologist. In 1984, Aki moved to the University of Southern California, where he could experience earthquake phenomena more directly. He became the founding science director of the Southern California Earthquake Center, where earthquake geologists and the fault model of quantitative seismology were used to make probabilistic estimates of earthquake hazards. He was also fascinated with volcano seismology, which he continued to study in \u2018retirement\u2019, especially on R\u00e9union with its local seismographic network. He studied volcanic tremor, estimated the location of magma chambers, monitored magma ascent and searched for physical causes. Aki probed more deeply into the phenomena of shaking ground, and with greater insight, than any other individual. He advanced our understanding of how earthquakes nucleate, how they reach their eventual size, and how their signals spread throughout the Earth, carrying information on their origin and what they have traversed. He showed us how to tease out this scientific information about sources and Earth structure. And he successfully faced the challenges of taking information about strong ground motions into the earthquake engineering community, and to policy-makers needing guidance on managing earthquake hazard. Kei Aki shared ideas with his more than 50 PhD students and numerous postdocs. He helped them to shine, and many are now leaders of their field. He himself was a gentle leader, informal and approachable, pleased with the many honours that came his way but never needing them, calm in adversity, and always eager to hear of new ideas that had some support from data. With his pioneering studies of seismic moment, his results on spectral scaling and coda stability, and his demonstration of successful methods to invert data to infer Earth structure in three dimensions, he provided methods that now guide the work of thousands of Earth scientists around the world.

But it seems that some metamorphism may be caused by tectonic events lasting only a decade. The Bergen Arcs in Norway are famous for rare and rather beautiful rocks known as eclogites. Striking, coarse-grained, and characterized by large pink garnets and a green matrix rich in silicates known as pyroxene ( Fig. 1 ), eclogites form at extremely high pressures, and are important indicators of the conditions in the deepest parts of mountain chains. In western Norway, they formed in a continental collision some 425 million years ago; since then, glaciers have ground and polished the rock surfaces to reveal the heart of the ancient collision zone, creating a wonderful natural laboratory in which to study processes that occur deep below a mountain chain \u2014 processes that must be happening today some 50 kilometres below the Himalayas. Geologists have learnt a great deal about continental collision-zones from the Bergen Arcs 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , and from their geologically rapid development and exhumation. But a new study challenges current understanding: based on high-spatial-resolution analyses of measurements of argon isotopes in the mineral phlogopite, Camacho  et al . 6  ( Short-lived orogenic cycles and the eclogitization of cold crust by spasmodic hot fluids ) propose that the partial transformation from a precursor rock-form, granulite, that characterizes the Norwegian eclogites, resulted from spasmodic, short-lived fluid-flow events lasting as little as 10 years. They also suggest that the crust at the collision zone was buried and exhumed sufficiently rapidly that it remained relatively cool during the whole cycle, which took less than 13 million years. The eclogites of the Bergen Arcs are confined to shear zones \u2014 where rocks deform plastically as they move sideways against each other \u2014 which are also fluid pathways. Between the shear zones are regions of untransformed granulite often just tens of metres across. The Bergen Arc eclogites 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5  formed at depths of some 60 km and temperatures of around 700 \u00b0C. Such temperatures evoke an image of very hot and plastically deforming rocks, but herein lies a paradox: though deformed at high temperatures, the Bergen Arc eclogites exhibit features more commonly associated with tectonic processes at lower temperatures closer to the Earth's surface, such as the brittle fracturing of the garnets they contain 7 , and the formation of pseudotachylites 8  (rocks formed by friction melting along fractures) within them. What is more, isotopic dating using the rubidium\u2013strontium ( 87 Rb\u2013 87 Sr) technique 9  yields an age closer to the untransformed granulite lenses in keeping with a known mountain-building event 930 million years ago 10  \u2014 even though the temperatures required for eclogite formation 425 million years ago 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5  should have obliterated any earlier signal. The paradoxical combination of granulite preservation, high-temperature eclogite formation and the brittle features of the eclogites has led several authors to suggest that the Bergen Arc granulite\u2013eclogite transformation occurred during short-lived fluid-flow events over less than a million years 8 . But the even shorter timescales proposed by Camacho  et al . 6  will make many geologists draw breath. Camacho and colleagues used argon\u2013argon ( 40 Ar\u2013 39 Ar) dating to measure the ages of phlogopite and amphibole mineral grains from the same untransformed granulite lenses that were investigated in the earlier  87 Rb\u2013 87 Sr work 7 . This technique works by creating the short-lived argon isotope  39 Ar through the irradiation of potassium ( 39 K) in mineral grains with neutrons. The age of the grains can then be ascertained from the ratio of neutron-induced  39 Ar to stable argon gas,  40 Ar, contained in them. ( 40 Ar forms from the decay of the radioactive potassium isotope  40 K, and its abundance indicates the elapsed time since the temperature was last high enough that argon could diffuse rapidly through the mineral, escaping at the boundaries between grains.) The particular advance of Camacho  et al . is the use of an ultraviolet laser technique to measure profiles of ages across individual mineral grains ascertained using the argon\u2013argon technique. The ages of between 820 and 895 million years that they find confirm the rubidium\u2013strontium results, and demonstrate just how little the granulite lenses were affected by the later eclogite formation. The authors 6  go on to estimate the temperature in the granulite lens during eclogite formation. Their conclusion \u2014 less than 400 \u00b0C \u2014 is a problem for the conventional interpretation of these rocks, given that a temperature of around 700 \u00b0C is required for the formation of the adjacent eclogites. Camacho  et al . calculate that the total heating durations must have been around 18,000 years to explain the  40 Ar\u2013 39 Ar age profiles, but that individual fluid-flow events must have lasted just ten years to avoid significant heating of the granulite regions between the shear zones. This model evokes a radically different picture of the conditions during eclogite formation; but any alternative explanation would have to invoke a mechanism that explains why these phlogopites retained argon despite exceeding temperatures at which the gas would normally escape. Camacho  et al . 6  give us a new and rapid process for eclogite formation in the Bergen Arcs. Such rapid fluid events are not without precedent 11  and help to reconcile some of the high-temperature, yet brittle, features of these rocks. However, the very short timescales involved will make this idea controversial, as existing work on garnet 12  seems to indicate processes operating on a million-year timescale; but also, perhaps, simply because we geologists are attuned to thinking in millions of years, whereas the features we observe may be just the aggregations of many shorter events. There is still a lot to learn from eclogites \u2014 and Camacho  et al . show us that the way forward is to focus more closely on high-resolution isotope variations in individual mineral grains and mineral interactions.

His discovery profoundly influenced Western culture by allowing, in theory, the \u2018mass\u2019 reproduction of religious and secular texts. In practice, however, the printed copies were distributed to workshops throughout Europe to be lavishly embellished, or \u2018illuminated\u2019, by hand with headlines and capital letters. Of the estimated 180 copies of the Bible that Gutenberg produced in three years up to 1455, substantial fragments of 48 survive. Tracey D. Chaplin  et al . ( Anal. Chem.  doi:10.1021/ac050346y) have used Raman spectroscopy \u2014 shining laser light onto a sample and analysing the spectrum of the scattered light \u2014 to study the chemical composition of the pigments used in the illuminations of seven copies of the Bible from libraries in France, Germany and Britain. Although the style of illumination varies widely between the Bibles, the chemical composition of the pigments used is remarkably similar, pointing to a shared knowledge of dyestuffs across fifteenth-century Europe.  Nine pigments are present, for example, in the King George III Bible (pictured) held in the British Library in London. The chemical composition of seven could be identified conclusively: red (cinnabar or mercury sulphide), blue (azurite, a basic copper carbonate), olive green (malachite, another basic copper carbonate), dark green (verdigris, an organo-copper compound), yellow (lead-tin oxide), black (carbon) and white (calcium carbonate). Copies of the Bible from two German libraries, printed on vellum, also contain the expensive blue pigment lazurite (lapis lazuli) \u2014 perhaps indicating commissions from wealthy families. The authors point out that, alongside the historical interest of their findings, an accurate knowledge of pigment make-up is crucial in helping to preserve and restore such cultural treasures.

He says:\u2014\u201cOur youths, like your youths, are human, and would be lazy if there were no penalty for idleness... I look at England and see the want of such an influence even in your public schools, which are good in a way, so far as they form character, but bad in that they neglect intellect.\u201d... The majority of our workers, he remarks, read little but the sporting Press, and care for little but betting and sport. It is pointed out that the Germans have destroyed in this generation the superstition that Germany makes only poor and cheap articles. \u201cOur Mercedes motors and scientific and optical instruments are the best and most expensive in the world, and no English article of their class can for a moment compete with them.\u201d From  Nature  8 June 1905.

If we are right in thinking that the structure of  B 8 is closely related to that of tobacco mosaic virus protein, then considerable importance must be attached to the reversal of the sign of birefringence in  B 8. We must conclude that the ribonucleic acid makes a positive contribution to the birefringence of tobacco mosaic virus, and hence that the purine and pyrimidine rings are aligned approximately parallel to the axis of the particle.

A clever trapping scheme circumvents this problem and may push timekeeping to new limits. Almost all clocks consist of two essential parts: an oscillator with periodically occurring events, and a counter to keep track of those events. For example sundials, the oldest known clocks, use Earth's rotation as the oscillator and a human as the counter. Pendulum clocks, first made by Christiaan Huygens in 1656, have a pendulum oscillator and an automatic mechanical counter to display time. Coming right up to date, on  page 321  of this issue, Takamoto and co-workers 1  demonstrate the latest innovation in timekeeping. Modern clocks use fast oscillators and electronic counters. In the quartz clocks developed in the 1920s, a small crystal is excited to vibrate typically some 10,000 times per second. In atomic clocks, the nucleus of an atom precesses in the field created by its electrons. Caesium atomic clocks use a standard detection method to follow these precessions 2  and to feed the resulting oscillatory signal to an electronic counter, which advances the second hand of the clock precisely every 9,192,631,770 cycles. This rather odd value corresponds to the transition frequency between two energy levels of the ground state of the caesium-133 atom and has been defined as the SI unit of time since 1967. Modern caesium atomic clocks can be as accurate as one part in 10 15 , which means that time is by far the most precisely measurable physical quantity. Because clock instability (the variation in its \u2018ticking\u2019, or displayed time flow) can be reduced by increasing the oscillator frequency, it is clear how even today's most precise caesium atomic clocks may be improved: replace the caesium by an optical oscillator. The typical frequencies for such optical oscillators are some 100 or even 1,000 THz (10 14  or 10 15  cycles per second), and the oscillations are emitted (or absorbed) in the form of light. For a long time, this kind of oscillator was much easier to create than a correspondingly fast optical counter or clock mechanism. Efforts to build a counter that was fast enough began in the early 1960s, but it was only in 1995 that counters were developed that could reach the frequency of visible light 3 . However, these delicate and complicated counters required a number of lasers, filling several large laboratories, and so were not generally considered a serious option for a clock mechanism. Things changed in 1999 with the introduction of an optical counter based on a pulsed femtosecond (10 \u221215 -second) laser 4 . This compact device can operate continuously for days, so that counting optical oscillations became a simple task, and the first experimental optical clocks appeared 5 . A good optical oscillator requires a sharp transition that gives a strong signal with little noise and a lack of sensitivity to external perturbations. Over the years, the quest for the most suitable oscillator has been pursued along two main lines. In the first approach, a single ion is trapped in electric fields and brought to rest by laser cooling. If both trap and ion are suitably chosen, the trapping fields will not seriously perturb the clock transition, which is triggered by a highly stable clock laser whose frequency is measured by an optical counter. Various ions are under consideration, and have produced impressive results (see for example ref.  6 ). But although trapped ions are largely immune to constant but unknown shifts in frequency within the system (so-called systematic uncertainties), they do not give stable enough measurements, because the signal is generated from only one ion and must be averaged over a long period. And it has not been possible to trap large numbers of ions without introducing large frequency shifts. The second approach uses clouds of millions of neutral atoms to produce a much stronger signal, resulting in excellent stability. However, collisions between the atoms result in uncontrollable shifts in frequency. In other words, single-ion standards have high statistical but low systematic uncertainties whereas neutral-atom standards have excellent statistics but poor systematic properties. Takamoto  et al . 1  demonstrate a method that combines the advantages of both atomic standards. Clouds of neutral strontium atoms are held in a different kind of trap formed at the crests (anti-nodes) of a standing wave produced by a laser ( Fig. 1a ). In previous attempts, the laser intensity that is needed to keep neutral atoms in place significantly perturbed the transition frequency. Measuring the intensity of the trapping laser to compensate for this negative effect does not work because intensity, unlike frequency or time, cannot be measured sufficiently accurately. Instead, the authors adjust the trapping-laser frequency \u2014 which would otherwise be unimportant \u2014 so that it shifts the upper and lower energy levels of the clock transition by exactly the same amount, leaving the clock-transition frequency unaltered ( Fig. 1b ). The frequency of the trapping laser is then set to the correct value \u2014 to within 1 MHz, which is sufficient to suppress its effect on the clock transition to less than 0.001 Hz at a clock frequency of 429 THz. All-optical clocks are predicted to keep time within a fractional uncertainty of 10 \u221218 . Such clocks could allow fundamental physical theories to be verified at a new level. Testing general relativity and quantum electrodynamics, and detecting slow variations in the fundamental constants predicted by some theories, rely on the most precise clocks. At the 10 \u221218  level of accuracy, the gravitational redshift of two clocks differing in their distance from Earth's centre by only 1 cm would become measurable. Moreover, the optical equivalent of very-long-baseline interferometry may become feasible, allowing higher-resolution astronomical images to be produced by combining data collected by widely separated telescopes. These clocks may also help to improve technologies, such as satellite navigation and broadband network synchronization, that are based on precision timing. Reprints and Permissions"},

His scientific achievements, as one of the most cited authors in biomedical science, were allied to a legendary clinical acumen, and a warmth and authority that secured the trust and devotion of his patients. Rosen passed most of his professional life at Harvard \u2014 at the Medical School, the Children's Hospital and the Center for Blood Research. This last he transformed, by dint of his formidable persuasive powers as a fund-raiser and his unerring eye for young talent, from an obscure relic into one of today's foremost centres of biomedical research. In his own field, that of hereditary immunodeficiencies \u2014 failures, commonly calamitous, at various sites in the labyrinths of the human immune system \u2014 he was undisputed monarch. Rosen gave early proof of his scientific mettle. He took special pride in the discovery, while still a resident, of a disease (X-linked hyper-IgM syndrome), the manifestations of which had long baffled paediatricians. The antibodies, or immunoglobulins, in the blood are the first line of defence against infection, and one form, IgM, predominates at birth. Rosen had already established that what were known as \u2018natural\u2019 antibodies to preceding generations of immunologists were in fact IgM molecules, which are unable to cross the placenta: this is the basis of the susceptibility of babies to bacterial infections. IgM is normally supplanted soon after birth by gamma globulin, or IgG. Rosen showed that the lack of IgG in his patients arose from an absence of the population of cells (B cells) in which it is normally made. This in turn resulted from the primary defect, which lies in the complementary cells (T cells) that in the normal state activate the B cells; and finally Rosen and his colleagues identified the aberrant gene. He went on to show that another lethal immune deficiency (X-linked agammaglobulinaemia) was characterized by a lack of all circulating B cells, and that the so-called common variable immunodeficiency could have a variety of causes; this revelation stimulated the search for unrecognized gene defects. All these discoveries shed new light on the workings of the normal immune system and redirected much of the thinking in the field. The complement cascade, a set of surveillance proteins circulating in the blood, is another part of the immunological armoury. These proteins act by attracting phagocytes, specialized cells that engulf and destroy bacteria or other interlopers. Rosen and his colleagues made a lasting impact on many aspects of this system \u2014 by the discovery, for example, of an inhibitor that lies at the root of hereditary malfunctions of one of the proteins (C1). Perhaps the most spectacular coup concerned another complement constituent, C3, a deficiency of which Rosen was able to link to a previously unfathomed disease in children. This proved the key to several other hereditary conditions, and further studies by Rosen and his associates eventually uncovered the chemical route by which C3 provokes phagocytosis. Rosen's last great contribution centred on an anomalous molecule found on the surface of T cells in patients suffering from a severe malady called Wiskott\u2013Aldrich syndrome. Its chemical nature led Rosen to divine that the anomaly might engender a disturbance in the cell's internal network of filaments governing shape and movement. So indeed it proved, and the discovery initiated a new departure in cell biology. There was more, but what united all of Rosen's undertakings was an acute sense of purpose, for his concern throughout was to understand the genesis of diseases, and to devise methods of treatment. He promoted the now universal treatment of immune deficiency with intravenous IgG, and thereby saved many lives and much misery. He and his colleagues performed the first successful bone-marrow transplants for two of the most dire immune conditions. This was quintessential \u2018translational research\u2019, long before that dispiriting term was invented. Albert Szent-Gy\u00f6rgyi viewed the practice of science as \u201cseeing what everybody else has seen, and thinking what nobody else has thought\u201d. This was Rosen's supreme gift, and his capacity to discern an interesting, important and, above all, soluble problem attracted a succession of talented and percipient colleagues, all eager to take up the challenges that he defined, and with all of whom he worked closely. Through everything, he treated, comforted and cheered his paediatric patients, for he had an especial rapport with the young, and he taught generations of students. His very appearance, that of an ample, genial teddy bear, radiated reassurance. His prodigious knowledge and sagacity made him a universal fount of information and good sense \u2014 the \u201cprimal Google\u201d, in the words of one of his acolytes. Fred Rosen had friends in all parts of the world. He could converse, write and lecture in any of a half-dozen or more languages. He was especially drawn to Russia and its literature, music and culture. He was instrumental in setting up a paediatric leukaemia unit in St Petersburg. On a typical occasion, he returned from South Africa, having interviewed and collected blood samples from a family with a new type of complement anomaly. They were Afrikaaner farmers, he recounted, and he had been surprised to find that they spoke no English at all. How then could he communicate with them? He looked mildly surprised at such an inane question: why, you could speak Dutch to them, of course. Rosen, in short, was a formidable polymath. He read omnivorously and retained it all. He knew more about antique furniture and silver than the dealers whom he patronized. He shopped at Fauchon and Herm\u00e8s, had his shirts made in Jermyn Street and took tea among the dowagers at Fortnum & Mason. His friends were astonished that this archetypal urbanite should have built a graceful house on the island of Anguilla in the Caribbean, and have found a warm affinity with the local community. It was there that he decided his remains should rest. Reprints and Permissions"},

Saunders Mac Lane, who died on 14 April, was one of the few mathematicians to create a major new concept that has had a lasting effect on the subject. In 1945, he and Sammy Eilenberg introduced the basic ideas of category theory, often described as a language of mathematics that allows the description of transformations from one area of the subject into another by distilling their common properties. More specifically, one can look at common properties of mathematical objects such as algebraic structures (groups, fields or rings) or topological spaces by studying structure-preserving mappings \u2014 \u2018morphisms\u2019 \u2014 between such objects. For example, in the case of vector spaces as mathematical objects, the structure-preserving mappings are the linear transformations, and one can study the \u2018category\u2019 of vector spaces using linear mappings as the morphisms between objects of the category. Concentrating on common properties of these structures by stripping away the non-essential aspects of a problem clears the path to new results. Mac Lane was born in Norwich, Connecticut, and studied at Yale University and the University of Chicago, where he obtained a master's degree in 1931. After doctoral studies at the University of G\u00f6ttingen in Germany, and appointments first as an assistant and then as a full professor at Harvard University, he returned to the University of Chicago in 1947. He remained there for the rest of his career, being appointed emeritus professor in 1982. Perhaps responding to some early comments on category theory, Mac Lane wrote in his autobiography: \u201cAt the time, we sometimes called our subject \u2018general abstract nonsense\u2019. We didn't really mean the nonsense part, and we were proud of its generality.\u201d Later, Mac Lane wrote  Categories for the Working Mathematician , the title of which reflects his ability to convey humorously a serious intention \u2014 in this case, to make an abstract idea relevant. Mac Lane's innovative contributions to mathematics had two roots. One was his interest in what he called \u2018universal knowledge\u2019, which he recognized as a student at Yale. With a wry awareness of the problems this posed, he later wrote: \u201cI believed that a proper academic ought to know everything, but of course, I never did succeed in mastering universality, nor do I know exactly what this might have meant.\u201d The other root was his firm belief that mathematics has to be developed from the specific to the general and that abstraction is a tool, not a goal. This belief is reflected in the books that he wrote.  A Survey of Modern Algebra , written 50 years ago with his co-instructor at Harvard, Garrett Birkhoff, is still used as a text; and his classic monograph,  Homology , in which every general concept is presented starting from a specific mathematical situation, still serves as an introduction and reference to that subject. Mac Lane's impact on the mathematical community went beyond his contributions as a researcher. According to the online \u2018Mathematics Genealogy Project\u2019, he had 39 students and 1,028 \u2018descendants\u2019. He recognized talent and let it flourish with modest interference. Among his prot\u00e9g\u00e9s were Irving Kaplansky, his first PhD student at Harvard, who later headed the Mathematical Sciences Research Institute at the University of California, Berkeley; and John Thompson, winner in 1970 of the highest mathematical honour, the Fields medal, for his work on the so-called \u2018odd-order\u2019 problem, which solved the Burnside conjecture that every finite simple group of non-prime order must have even order. Recalling his work with Thompson, Mac Lane wrote: \u201cBy the end of the second quarter, in which I had tended to emphasize infinite groups, I had essentially come to the end of my knowledge on group theory. Thompson, who was in the course, came to me to say that he wished to write a thesis on group theory. I encouraged him, but did not trouble to say that my own knowledge of the subject was somewhat limited. But not to worry \u2014 I arranged for eminent theorists, such as Richard Brauer, Reinhold Baer, and Marshall Hall, to visit Chicago. Each Saturday morning, I listened to Thompson tell me what he had been up to with groups; the subject fitted his interest, and he chose his own problems.\u201d This spirit of guidance and selfless encouragement probably grew out of Mac Lane's time in G\u00f6ttingen, then the Mecca of mathematics, in the early 1930s, where he became immersed in an atmosphere of intellectual challenge and excitement that formed his views. It was there that he received his PhD with a thesis on \u201cAbbreviated proofs in logic calculus\u201d. Following ideas from Alfred North Whitehead and Bertrand Russell, he worked on formalizing mathematical proof. The subject did not impress his advisers Hermann Weyl and Paul Bernays, and in Mac Lane's own words: \u201cMy thesis did not attract any following, nor did it have any influence on subsequent studies of mechanized proof.\u201d In his later career, Mac Lane took his responsibilities to the wider scientific community very seriously, always devoting his full energies to the task at hand. He was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1949, and served as vice-president of the academy and of the American Philosophical Society, and as president of the American Mathematical Society. During his presidency of the Mathematical Association of America in the 1950s, he began the association's first efforts to improve the teaching of modern mathematics. He was also a member of the National Science Board (1974\u201380), which provided science policy advice to the US government. In 1976, he led a delegation of mathematicians to the People's Republic of China to examine the conditions affecting the development of mathematics there. In 1989, he received the highest US award for scientific achievement, the National Medal of Science. During the past few years, Mac Lane was engaged in writing his autobiography, and I have been privileged to be a part of that process. In the book, he wanted to convey to a new generation of mathematicians the joy of the creative process and the excitement that he experienced in being part of history. Reprints and Permissions"},

Marangos"}], "parsed_as_year": "2006_or_before", "body": "The observation that there is interference between a laser-induced electron wave and a single molecule means that it may be possible to image changes in molecular structure with a sub-femtosecond resolution. Scientists have long dreamt of being able to instantaneously image molecular structure with a temporal resolution less than a femtosecond (10 \u221215  s) \u2014 the timescale of fundamental physical and chemical changes. A technique with the potential to do this is reported by Kanai  et al . 1  on  page 470  of this issue. The measurement uses an intense laser field to tear an electron from a molecule (ionization), accelerate it and then drive it back towards the molecule a fraction of an optical cycle later (about 1 femtosecond). The electron recombines with the molecule, giving up the energy it acquired (typically 30\u201370 eV) as a single, soft X-ray photon in a process known as high-order harmonic generation. The returning electron can be considered as a superposition of electron waves of different energy and momentum. The de Broglie wavelength of an electron wave is given by  \u03bb = h / p  where  h  is Planck's constant and  p  is the momentum of the electron. The intensity of emission at a particular X-ray photon energy is sensitive to the wavelength of the electron wave and the shape of the wavefunction of the electrons in the molecule. It is possible to use this phenomenon to probe structures because the electron wavelength is comparable to the size of the molecular wavefunction. When the electron wavelength matches the distance between the nuclei of the molecule, the internuclear separation, interference occurs between the emission amplitudes from different parts of the molecule and modulates the total intensity of soft X-ray emission ( Fig. 1 ). The value of the photon energy at which the modulation is observed indicates the internuclear spacing at that instant. This type of interference in the high-order harmonic process from molecules was first predicted several years ago 2 , but had not yet been seen. Kanai and co-workers 1  now report that they have observed this phenomenon. Their experiment involved the measurement of high-order harmonic generation from a gas of linear molecules (N 2 , O 2  or CO 2 ) with their axes aligned in space. An initial, ultrafast laser pulse, which excites a \u2018rotational wavepacket\u2019 (a coherent superposition of states) in the molecules, controls the molecular alignment 3 . The rotational wavepacket then exhibits strong molecular-axis alignment at regular periods (every 5.4 picoseconds in the case of CO 2 ). A second, higher-intensity, ultrafast laser pulse (about 2\u00d710 14  W cm \u22122 ) then produces high-harmonic emission from molecules close to the maximum degree of alignment. By precisely varying the delay before the second pulse, the emission intensity for different magnitudes and angles of alignment can be measured. The set-up and the principle are similar to those employed by Itatani  et al . 4 , who used a tomographic retrieval technique to image the electronic states of a nitrogen molecule. The advance of Kanai  et al . is the simultaneous observation of the ionization and the intensity of the soft X-ray emission, allowing the efficiency of the first, ionization step of the process to be separated from the efficiency of the final step when the electron wave recombines with the molecular electronic state. The authors found a minimum in the harmonic emission from CO 2  at maximum ionization. In contrast, O 2  and N 2  had maximum harmonic emission at maximum ionization. For CO 2 , the greatly reduced efficiency of the recombination step results from destructive interference. The parts of the molecular electronic state of CO 2  located near the two oxygen atoms make equal but opposite contributions to the X-ray emission, as Kanai  et al . explain. The suppression of the harmonic emission occurred when the two oxygen atoms in the molecule are separated by exactly one complete wavelength of the electron wave. The soft X-ray emission amplitude from each of the two oxygen atoms is then exactly out of phase, leading to destructive interference in the total emission. In principle, laser-driven electron-wave interference provides a powerful tool for measuring the distances between atoms in molecules with a resolution of a fraction of a nanometre. The technique directly pinpoints the position of the atomic nuclei and complements tomographic reconstruction 4 , which can retrieve the full electronic wavefunction. The information retrieved through tomographic imaging is more complete. But Kanai and co-workers' technique is much easier to implement as it requires only the measurement of the angular dependence of ion and harmonic signals, and requires no sophisticated processing of the data. By observing the emitted soft X-ray spectrum over a range of photon energies, it is possible to see the interference arising from different bond lengths. This proof-of-principle experiment has only looked at a very simple, linear triatomic molecule, and it will have to be tested with complex molecules. Nevertheless, it may be possible to use this method to carry out pump-probe studies that follow the internuclear separation as it changes on a timescale of a few femtoseconds.

My first contact with Einstein was in Vienna in September 1913... he lectured to the Physics Section on \u201cGravitation\u201d, and his lecture quite obviously impressed most of his hearers as the work of a master-mind. But it was clear in the discussion which followed that many German-speaking men of science were not yet converted to his ideas... Einstein remained smilingly unperturbed and said he was prepared to stand or fall by the results of an empirical examination of his predictions. He had not very long to wait, for when I translated his popular work on \u201cRelativity\u201d in 1920, I suggested to him that he might like to include an appendix on the experimental confirmation of the theory... His world-wide and unsought fame undoubtedly reached its zenith with the confirmation of his predicted gravitational deflexion of light rays by Eddington and others in 1919... His first comments in Britain on the results of the solar eclipse expeditions were published at the request of  The Times ... Referring to this in a letter to me, he wrote: \u201cIt cannot do any harm, for, thank God, the solar eclipse and the theory of relativity have nothing in common with politics...

Such altruistic behaviour occurs in long-tailed tits ( Aegithalos caudatus , pictured), which Stuart Sharp and colleagues have studied to find out what cues enable a \u2018helper\u2019 to recognize kin. Their report appears elsewhere in this issue (  Nature   434 , 1127\u20131130; 2005 ). Adult long-tailed tits pair off and attempt to breed each year, but many don't succeed because of high rates of predation on the eggs or nestlings. The childless parents may then turn to assisting kin in feeding their brood \u2014 which makes sense in evolutionary terms but requires some form of recognition system. Long-tailed tits are not the greatest of vocalists. They sing infrequently but do have an individually characteristic contact call, the \u2018churr\u2019, which develops even before fledging and is retained in the adult bird. The first part of Sharp and colleagues' research involved the playback to individuals of churr calls belonging to a close relative and a non-relative, and a further two trials in which the frequency of these calls had been tweaked. The responses of birds to the untweaked calls of relatives differed significantly from their responses to the other three calls. From this, the authors conclude that the churr call provides cues involved in kin recognition. The most innovative part of the study, however, was an investigation into how much churr acquisition owes to nurture (learning) and nature (genetics). This took the form of swapping young birds between nests, so that adult birds were raising foster nestlings along with their true offspring. The churr calls of the fostered birds were the same as those of their nestmates, and unlike those of their biological siblings raised elsewhere \u2014 so it seems that the churr is in large part learned.  The pattern of helping observed in long-tailed tits is consistent with the use of this learned cue in the great majority of cases. But this kin-recognition system evidently isn't faultless: in 6% of cases, an adult helped unrelated nestlings. As the authors point out, recognition systems are rarely perfect.

But the watering of men and animals on the scale indicated by the areas enclosed would be a formidable task even for a day, and other explanations must be sought. The late General Pitt-Rivers, for example, held that the water-level of the combes was higher then than now, and streams would have been plentiful on the slopes; but, feeling the inadequacy of this view, he also had recourse to the dew-pond theory... An exposed position innocent of springs was selected, and straw or some other non-conductor of heat spread over the hollowed surface. This was next covered with a thick layer of well puddled clay, which was closely strewn with stones. The pond would gradually fill, and provide a constant supply of pure water, due to condensation during the night of the warm, moist air from the ground on the surface of the cold clay...

The present investigations were carried out on birds by the method devised by Billingham, Brent and Medawar, and had a threefold purpose: (1) investigation of whether tolerance could be acquired to cells of foreign species; (2) if so, whether the tolerance would also extend to a virus from the donor animal to which the recipient was not normally susceptible; (3) whether a sexual cross between species which is not normally possible could be made so by means of acquired tolerance.

By inviting leaders of literature, art, and science to meet the King, graceful recognition was given of the high place occupied by the muses in the polity of the Republic.

Robert Horvitz"}], "parsed_as_year": "2006_or_before", "body": "When Stan Korsmeyer was in the eighth grade and looking forward to playing high-school sports, he was told by the school coach that he would have to grow six inches before he would be allowed on any of the teams. Being determined but nonetheless pragmatic, Korsmeyer decided to focus his energies in an alternative direction \u2014 raising hogs. Raise hogs he did, and at age 14 Korsmeyer became the youngest person in the history of the Illinois State Fair to show the Grand Champion pair of Hampshire hogs. Two old-time Illinois farmers were heard discussing the competition. One asked, \u201cWho showed the Grand Champions this year?\u201d The other replied, \u201cJust some kid.\u201d It was not \u201cjust some kid\u201d. It was Stan Korsmeyer, who even then dedicated himself to and excelled at whatever he did. Korsmeyer was born on 8 June 1950, on a farm among the cornfields of southern Illinois, and he planned to be a veterinarian. However, as an undergraduate at the University of Illinois in Urbana, he became interested in curing people instead of livestock. In 1976 he earned an MD at the University of Illinois in Chicago. A move to the University of California, San Francisco, allowed him to continue his medical training and to meet his wife-to-be Susan, an oncology nurse. This move also introduced Korsmeyer to sailing and fishing, two passions that continued throughout his life. Korsmeyer's next move was to the opposite coast (in part to continue his proximity to an ocean), to the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, where, as a fellow in molecular oncology, he trained with leading cancer researchers Thomas Waldmann and Philip Leder. Korsmeyer continued his career as an independent researcher at the NCI, and then as an investigator of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, first at Washington University in St Louis and later at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Harvard Medical School in Boston. Korsmeyer opened new doors to the understanding and treatment of cancer. He co-discovered the oncogene  Bcl-2 , which when overexpressed can lead to follicular lymphoma. His studies provided evidence that  Bcl-2  was the first member of a new category of cancer-causing genes \u2014 genes that work not by driving cells to proliferate, but rather by preventing them from dying via a process known as programmed cell death, or apoptosis. By causing cells that normally die to survive instead, elevated expression of  Bcl-2  can allow those cells to accumulate additional mutations and become cancerous. Korsmeyer also discovered other members of the  Bcl-2  gene family and found that they too regulate cell death. Whereas members such as  Bcl-2  protect cells from dying, others, including  Bax ,  Bad  and  Bid , cause cells to die. Korsmeyer proposed a rheostat model for the regulation of cell death, in which the crucial \u2018life versus death\u2019 decision made by each cell is determined by the balance between the activities of antagonistic survival and killer genes. He also discovered that  Bcl-2  family members are associated with mitochondria, the power plants of cells, and thus implicated mitochondria in the process of apoptosis. Korsmeyer's studies helped to establish that many human disorders \u2014 including lymphomas and other cancers \u2014 can be caused by a misregulation of apoptosis. In short, he made crucial contributions to the elucidation of the molecular-genetic pathway that controls cell survival and cell death and to the discovery that the misregulation of cell death has a major role in human disease. That a deficit in apoptosis can cause tumours implied that cancers might be treated by reactivating apoptosis and causing tumour cells to self-destruct. Korsmeyer's research elegantly demonstrated that cancer cells can be induced to die either by blocking anti-cell-death genes such as  Bcl-2 , or by activating pro-cell-death genes such as  Bax . As a consequence, the  Bcl-2  family has become a promising target for anticancer drugs. Korsmeyer himself worked directly to develop new treatments for cancer based on his knowledge of apoptosis. Although we met frequently at scientific meetings, it was in the context of our serving as consultants to a start-up biotechnology company focused on apoptosis that I got to know Korsmeyer best. His science and advice helped to make  Bcl-2  a major target, and as a consequence a drug that blocks  Bcl-2  action is currently under development at a major pharmaceutical company. Korsmeyer's drive to develop an anticancer drug and to cure cancer patients was tempered by his concern about the risks of clinical trials. \u201cI would never want to be involved in the trial of a drug that I wouldn't be willing to test on my own sons,\u201d he once told me. Those sons, Evan and Jason, as well as his wife Susan, were at the centre of his life, and his statement about drug trials reflected Korsmeyer's deep empathy for others. Korsmeyer had a farm boy's work ethic, dedication, energy and modesty. He also had an unshakeable determination, as well as a great sense of humour, a joyous and immediately recognizable laugh, enormous personal warmth, an optimism about people, and an infectious and constantly upbeat approach to life. I never knew anyone who did not like him. He cared enormously about the young scientists who trained with him; he was a superb mentor and seeded the biomedical world with his scientific offspring. He received many well-deserved prizes and honours for his discoveries. Stan Korsmeyer, a non-smoker, died on 31 March of lung cancer. His death is a tragic loss to science, medicine and humanity. He may never have grown the six inches demanded by his high-school coach, but he was nonetheless a giant \u2014 as a scientist, a mentor, a friend and a human being. Reprints and Permissions"},

They deal with two very different animals \u2014 one a marine invertebrate and the other a terrestrial vertebrate. The softshell clam ( Mya arenaria ) occurs around the Atlantic coast of North America. The clams can become contaminated with saxitoxin, the cause of paralytic shellfish poisoning in humans and economic losses to the shellfish industry. The toxin is produced by \u2018red tide\u2019 algae and finds its way into the clams when the algae are ingested. V. Monica Bricelj  et al . ( Nature   434 , 763\u2013767; 2005 10.1038/nature03415 ) show that clams from areas subject to recurrent red tides are relatively resistant to the toxin and tend to accumulate it in their tissues. But clams from unaffected areas have low resistance when exposed to the toxin in the laboratory. These differences were mirrored by the sensitivity of isolated clam nerve-trunks exposed to the toxin  in vitro . To investigate the underlying molecular mechanism, Bricelj  et al . sequenced the genomic region encoding a putative voltage-gated sodium channel. Such channels sit in cell membranes and regulate ion flow. The authors found a single mutation that correlated with resistance to the toxin, and that results in replacement of a glutamic acid by aspartic acid at a site previously implicated in the binding of saxitoxin. When introduced into a channel from rat brain, this mutation did not affect ion conductance. But the sensitivity of the channel to saxitoxin was greatly reduced owing to a large decrease in the binding affinity of the toxin at the channel pore.  Saxitoxin produced by red-tide algae probably acts as a potent selective agent on the clams, leading to genetic adaptation, the target of selection being genetic variation at a single site in an ion channel. But this phenomenon is not unique to clams. Saxitoxin is related to another nerve poison called tetrodotoxin (TTX). In some populations of the newt  Taricha granulosa , individuals accumulate large amounts of TTX in their skin as a defence against garter snakes ( Thamnophis sirtalis ; pictured). As a result, the snakes that prey on toxic newts have evolved high levels of resistance to the toxin. Shana L. Geffeney  et al . (  Nature   434 , 759\u2013763; 2005 ) show that variation in the level of resistance of garter snakes co-evolving with their newt prey can be traced to molecular changes that affect the binding of TTX to \u2014 you guessed it \u2014 a sodium channel. So similar mechanisms underlie the adaptation of both softshell clams and garter snakes to regular neurotoxin exposure. Evolution is baroque in its many aspects, but is sometimes more predictable than we imagine. Reprints and Permissions"},

The \u2018clock\u2019 used is an ammonia molecule which radiates an electric dipole spectrum as a set of lines of about 6 mm. wavelength and, as used in the instrument, maintains its frequency to the above order of magnitude. This would be sufficient to enable it to measure variation in the rate of rotation of the earth... the instrument consists of a molecular beam of ammonia molecules which are excited in an electric field and then pass into a tuned cavity-resonator, where they induce each other to radiate by negative absorption... It seems that the method of use is to extract by means of wave-guides the radiation emitted by two \u2018masers\u2019, tuned to different but adjacent frequencies by the ammonia spectrum. When mixed, the beat frequency can then be counted electronically. The \u2018maser\u2019 is also claimed by its inventor to be very effective as an amplifier. From  Nature  9 April 1955.

Stars containing extremely small amounts of heavy elements such as iron provide clues to the chemical composition of this matter. Identifying stars born at the beginning of the era of stellar formation proved a long and frustrating task. In 2002, however, Christlieb  et al . 1  reported the discovery of the first such \u2018relic of the dawn of time\u2019. Writing on  page 871  of this issue, Frebel  et al . 2  announce the discovery of a second. But why are these two objects so remarkable? And why does it help to have two instead of one? Some 13.7 billion years ago, the Universe was much simpler than it is today. It consisted of a uniform, hot gas showing only small fluctuations in temperature and density, and containing no large structures \u2014 no galaxies, stars or planets. For the first 15 minutes of its existence, the temperature and density of this hot gas were high enough to allow the nuclear reactions necessary for the production of the lightest chemical elements. Heavier elements, such as the metals, were not produced in this first flurry of nucleosynthetic activity. After the first 15 minutes, the Universe's rapid expansion put an end to conditions that favoured nucleosynthesis and nothing more happened to the nuclear composition of the Universe for about 200 million years. The ingredients of this frozen primordial soup \u2014 principally, the light elements lithium and helium, as well as deuterium, a heavy isotope of hydrogen \u2014 are fairly well known from both theory and experiment 3 . A second opportunity for nuclear activity arose only when the original fluctuations of the early Universe had grown sufficiently large for haloes of dark matter to begin to form. This triggered gravitational instabilities and the collapse of conventional baryonic matter into clouds of gas, from which stars then formed 4 ; in the cores of these stars, both the temperature and density reached values that again made nuclear reactions possible. Practically all the heavier elements, from carbon to uranium \u2014 the elements from which later solid planets and organic life formed \u2014 were synthesized in these first stars. The search for stars with a composition reflecting that of these first stars has been going on for the past 25 years 5 , 6 . Before the discovery of the two \u2018relics\u2019 (HE0107\u20135240 by Christlieb  et al . 1  and HE1327\u20132326 by Frebel  et al . 2 ), the lowest proportion, with respect to hydrogen, of stellar-made elements in the oldest stars was about a ten-thousandth of that observed in the Sun \u2014 a tiny amount, but, crucially, not zero. This finding seemed to support the theory that matter from the Big Bang was unable to fragment into stellar masses that were small enough for those stars still to be shining today: massive stars burn their fuel faster, and a star with a mass greater than around nine-tenths of the mass of the Sun would have exhausted its nuclear energy supply by now. Long-lived stars could thus be born only from interstellar gas already enriched in products of nucleosynthesis that had been expelled at the end of the evolution of earlier stars \u2014 either through a violent event such as a supernova, or through less dramatic mass loss, as is caused for example by stellar winds. If true, this would have ruled out any hope of finding a star with the primordial mix. The discovery of HE0107\u20135240 and HE1327\u20132326, which have iron abundances respectively 200,000 and 300,000 times smaller than that of the Sun, is therefore of great significance. However, despite their impressively low iron content \u2014 well below the previous record, which stood for some 20 years before their discovery 7  \u2014 both stars contain a proportion of carbon that is only 25 times smaller than that of the Sun. And the deficiency of the various elements between carbon and iron in the periodic table increases steadily with increasing atomic number. The main difference between the two relics is that, in the case of HE0107\u20135240, it proved impossible to determine whether lithium, carbon and nitrogen were still present in their original abundances. Frebel  et al . 2 , however, have been able to measure the abundance of lithium in HE1327\u20132326; surprisingly, it is far lower than that in other very old metal-poor stars. Other questions raised by HE1327\u20132326 are its abundance of nitrogen, which is 60 times larger than that of HE0107\u20135240; the shallower slope of the decrease of elemental abundances with atomic number; and the presence of strontium, not seen in HE0107\u20135240. Previous work may help to unravel these mysteries. For example, it has been shown 8  that a supernova may expel only the upper layers of the nuclear matter of the pre-supernova star, enriching the carbon and oxygen content of the interstellar matter, whereas the iron falls back on to the remnant of the star. The abundance of iron in a star is irrelevant to the fragmentation process 9 : carbon and oxygen are thought to be the elements controlling the cooling of the interstellar matter, and it is their high abundance that allows the star to fragment into small masses. Rotation can also produce devastating effects on the evolution of massive stars with low metal abundances 10 : if its initial rotation is sufficiently great, the star experiences a significant loss of mass, shedding great quantities of the first elements synthesized \u2014 helium, carbon, oxygen and magnesium. It is exactly these elements that are among the most abundant in HE0107\u20135240 and HE1327\u20132326. Rotation also triggers an efficient mixing mechanism that allows the synthesis of nitrogen as well as carbon and oxygen. This is of significance for HE1327\u20132326, in which \u2014 after hydrogen and helium, both of primordial origin \u2014 nitrogen is the most abundant element. It is fascinating to see that, having taken 20 years to undercut the previous lowest iron abundance in a star, we have within two years found two stars containing more than an order of magnitude less iron. This is the reward for an enormous effort in observational work that is bringing new insights to the fragmentation process that occurred during the formation of the first stars.

Considering a gas the molecules of which radiate into empty space, he shows that in an approximately steady state the energy of vibrational modes may bear a negligible ratio to that of translational and rotational modes. I have myself speculated in this direction; but it seems that the difficulty revives when we consider a gas, not radiating into empty space, but bounded by a perfectly reflecting enclosure. There is then nothing of the nature of dissipation; and, indeed, the only effect of the appeal to the aether is to bring in an infinitude of new modes of vibration, each of which, according to the law, should have its full share of the total energy. I cannot give the reference, but I believe that this view of the matter was somewhere expressed, or hinted, by Maxwell. We know that the energy of aetherial vibrations, corresponding to a given volume and temperature, is not infinite or even proportional to the temperature.

So are scientists. A rather prosaic answer to the source of fragrance \u2014 for one species at least \u2014 is that it has a lot to do with the  ODORANT1  gene (see  Plant Cell  doi:10.1105/tpc.104.028837; 2005 ). Julian C. Verdonk  et al . have studied  Petunia hybrida  (pictured), which emits its scent at night to attract its nocturnal pollinators, hawkmoths. The scent consists of a combination of volatile benzenoid compounds. The chain of precursors from which benzenoids are produced is well understood, but what's less clear is why their synthesis and release peak at night. To find out, Verdonk  et al . compared the genes expressed in flowers that were producing scent with those from flowers that were just about to produce scent and those from a different  P. hybrida  cultivar that emits low levels of benzenoids. This led the authors to a gene that they have called  ODORANT1  ( ODO1 ), whose activity is increased in the fragrant flowers at the appropriate time of day. Sequence comparisons suggested that the protein encoded by  ODO1  is a gene regulator. Indeed, eliminating  ODO1  expression led to decreased expression of several other genes, whose protein products catalyse early steps in the benzenoid-synthesis pathway. Benzenoid production was also decreased. Curiously, however, there was no effect on flower colour, even though one of the benzenoid precursors is also involved in making floral pigments. That tallies with the idea that pigment production occurs at an earlier developmental stage than scent synthesis, and so is unaffected by the later experimental interference with  ODO1  expression. That won't be the end of this scented story, however. One obvious question is how  ODO1  itself is turned on at the right time. Another is how its protein product interacts with its target genes \u2014 does it do so directly or through other factors? And can the scent of other plant species be attributed to  ODO1  activity?

Competition pervades everyday life and sculpts our society. It is also an essential factor in the sculpting of our brains. On  page 1022  of this issue, Hua and colleagues 1  provide new insight into the rules that underlie this competition. Our brains contain billions of nerve cells that are wired together in a specific manner. During brain development, these nerve cells extend thin processes \u2014 axons \u2014 that branch and establish contacts with other brain cells. The contacts, called synapses, are sites at which neurons communicate through the release of chemical neurotransmitters. One of the most fundamental but also most complex questions in neuroscience is how the appropriate connections are formed when the brain develops. A detailed map of the vast number of synapses in the adult brain cannot be laid out in our genes: our genome is simply too small to specify such a complicated network. It is now well established that specific molecular cues act as signposts that guide growing axons to their target cells. But the refinement of the connections depends on neural activity. A wealth of data suggests that electrical activity in developing networks influences the branching of the terminal parts (the \u2018arbors\u2019) of axons, and hence the formation of functional neural circuits 2 . Current dogma, inspired by elegant studies of the development of peripheral motor axons, holds that activity moulds the axonal arbor by regulating the extent and rate of branch retractions. Hua  et al . 1  add to this by providing evidence that activity can also control the extent and rate of branch formation. Furthermore, their findings point to a new set of rules for activity-based competition between neighbouring axons: less active axons lose out in the competition with their more active peers by being denied the possibility of fully developing their terminal arbors. To look at the effects of neural activity on branch formation, Hua  et al . used the retinotectal pathway in zebrafish as a model system ( Fig. 1 ). This pathway is involved in the control of eye movements, and is formed by the axons of retinal ganglion cells. By transfecting individual ganglion cells with a fluorescent marker (whereby genes expressing the marker are transferred to the cell using a virus), the authors could monitor the growth and branching of single retinotectal axons by two-photon microscopy in live zebra-fish. Two-photon microscopy is well suited for such analyses 3 , 4  because it allows many images to be obtained without interfering unduly with the growth process. To investigate how inactive axons fared in the competition with active neighbouring ones, Hua  et al . needed to suppress the activity of single axons. To this end, they took advantage of previous findings 5  showing that individual neurons can be silenced by transfecting them with a specific type of potassium channel \u2014 the human inward rectifier K +  channel Kir2.1. Transfected cells are silenced because overexpression of Kir2.1 causes them to hyperpolarize. Hua and colleagues' key observation was as follows: axons of cells that were made to overexpress Kir2.1, and which were presumably inactive, showed reduced growth and produced less elaborate terminal arbors compared with the axons of adjacent cells ( Fig. 1a ). In itself, this finding cannot be taken as evidence of competition: growth could have been impeded as a direct consequence of inactivation. This possibility was ruled out by a crucial experiment in which all axons of the retinotectal pathway were silenced by tetrodotoxin \u2014 a neurotoxin isolated from puffer fish. It turned out that this neurotoxin restored the ability of the Kir2.1-expressing axons to grow terminal arbors ( Fig. 1b ). So the growth inhibition of individually silenced Kir2.1-expressing axons must be due to negative feedback \u2014 directly or indirectly \u2014 from nearby, active axons. What could be the mechanism that explains why Kir2.1-expressing neurons lose this growth competition with normal cells? An obvious possibility is that the effects of Kir2.1 overexpression are mediated through neuronal hyperpolarization, and a consequent block of neurotransmitter release. In support of this, Hua  et al . found that the inhibitory effect of Kir2.1 on axon growth could be reproduced by transfecting retinal ganglion cells with a modified synaptic protein that suppresses the recycling of synaptic vesicles (a crucial stage in synaptic neurotransmission). Later-acting mechanisms are less clear. One possibility is that inactive axons fall prey to inhibition by adjacent, more active axons through the release of retrograde signals from the axons' target cells in the tectum (the dorsal part of the midbrain). Hua and colleagues' main conclusion is that activity-based competition between axons sets in at an early stage, before the axons have developed a full terminal arbor. The axons seem forced to obey the rule that if you are less active than your neighbour, you are not allowed to grow. These findings do not overthrow the current dogma \u2014 that competition acts by way of axon retraction or elimination. Rather, they suggest that the picture is more complicated, and that relative activity influences the development of functional networks by affecting axon growth as well as axon regression. These conclusions must, however, be tempered by the fact that the experimental design \u2014 based on silencing individual axons \u2014 does not mirror the situation in the developing brain, where neighbouring axons are likely to compete on more equal terms. Nonetheless, through their ingenious combination of techniques, Hua  et al . 1  have provided fresh insight into the mechanisms that sculpt the developing brain. One is left wondering to what extent this newly discovered rule for axon competition applies to other neuronal pathways and other species \u2014 and whether this rule is also relevant to the ability of the mature brain to develop and change.

The mechanism remains a mystery. Variety is the spice of life. This adage applies as much to genetic material as to anything else \u2014 if DNA were static, there would be no change over time and no evolution. Everything in moderation, though, to use another proverb. Most random changes in DNA (mutations) are harmless, because much of our DNA has no essential function. Nevertheless, of all possible mutations, the ones that are detrimental far outnumber those that might have a positive effect. Unwanted changes in DNA, which occur quite often, can have disastrous consequences and lead to all sorts of diseases. How, then, does the genome heal itself? Lolle and colleagues 1  have just had the first glimpse of a novel mechanism that does just that. They report their findings on  page 505  of this issue. The genome has sophisticated tools for correcting mutations every time a cell replicates its DNA in preparation for cell division 2 . This machinery, which discovers incorrect copying or damage in the DNA, is essential for avoiding the accumulation of unwanted mutations during our lifetime. There is nothing mysterious about this process, as it uses the intact DNA strand as a template for correcting mistakes on the broken or damaged strand. But can the genome also detect mutations that have become \u2018fixed\u2019, where the DNA sequence on both strands has changed? Reversion of fixed mutations is less unusual than one might suppose, but it generally relies on the original DNA still being present. For example, transposons, which are essentially parasitic sequences of DNA, may insert into a gene and disrupt its activity. But if the transposon is precisely excised, and the host DNA stuck back together, the gene reverts to its normal state. More intriguing are cases in which fixed changes revert to the original sequence without an apparent template. For example, in microbes, revertants that confer some sort of physiological response can be easily selected from large numbers of individuals. Thus, although mutations back to the original sequence are rare, on the order of one in a billion per site and per generation, the large population size makes the isolation of revertants possible. There is even evidence that stress increases the frequency at which revertants occur 3 . Amazingly, precise reversion events have also been described in humans 4 . Unfortunately, it is unclear whether these events are more frequent than expected by chance. By contrast, there is no doubt that the reversion rates observed by Lolle and colleagues 1  in the plant  Arabidopsis  cannot be explained by random mutations. The authors' spectacular discovery started with a mutant called  hothead , in which various organs are fused. What made  hothead  special was not its morphological defects but the finding that several independent mutant strains yielded apparently normal progeny at a high frequency (a few per cent). Lolle and colleagues show that this is due to precise reversion that restores the original DNA sequence. They ruled out several trivial explanations: the reversion is not due simply to a drastic increase in mutation rate, and it could not have been caused by gene conversion, where a related gene from elsewhere in the genome is used as a template. Nor is the reversion specific to the  HOTHEAD  gene or to harmful mutations, as the authors show by using hybrids carrying innocuous sequence changes at several other sites in the genome ( Fig. 1 ). They find that  hothead  mutant progeny at later generations can recover DNA variants that have come from one of their great-grandparents, even if their immediate parent did not contain the variant. Why does reversion occur so frequently in  hothead  mutants? The  HOTHEAD  gene itself does not seem to encode a protein with an obvious connection to DNA repair 5 , so the authors speculate that the high reversion frequency may indicate a response to some sort of elevated metabolic stress. Another fascinating question is what template the cell uses to restore the original DNA sequence. From the authors' experiments it seems unlikely that the template is a cache of extra-chromosomal DNA. Rather, it may well be an unknown species of RNA. This is not unreasonable, as DNA and RNA can be copied back and forth precisely 2 , and RNA molecules can, for example, guide dramatic DNA sequence changes in some organisms 6 . An obvious candidate would be messenger RNA, which is an intermediate molecule involved when the DNA sequence is being translated into protein. However, the sequence reversions observed by Lolle and colleagues are not restricted to those parts of the genome that are normally copied into messenger RNA. Many experiments to explore this mechanism of unorthodox inheritance, which can skip several generations, come to mind. But it seems a safe bet that the isolation of secondary mutants that have lost the ability to produce healthy progeny will provide helpful clues. Reprints and Permissions"},

But much of Curien's success also resided in his disarming humility, and his wry sense of humour, simplicity and  savoir vivre . As a journalist, I was always struck by the fact that, despite the burdens of office, Curien always seemed to have time to discuss and to listen. He was deeply appreciated by the research community, who have fond memories of his terms of office as science minister under four socialist prime ministers \u2014 Laurent Fabius (1984\u201386), Michel Rocard (1988\u201391), Edith Cresson (1991\u201392) and Pierre B\u00e9r\u00e9govoy (1992\u201393). His mix of talents allowed Curien slowly, but surely, to take his visions forward, not least his ambitions for European space science and exploration, in the complex context of European politics \u2014 where, to this day, national interests and bureaucracy stymie grand ideas. Back in the 1970s, who would have imagined that Ariane, Europe's fledgling rocket launched from ESA's spaceport in Kourou, French Guiana, would grow to dominate the world market and give Europe independent access to space? Curien was born in Cornimont in the Vosges region of eastern France in 1924; his mother was a headmistress and his father a tax collector. In 1944, he enlisted in the French resistance. The Second World War left a lasting impression on Curien, forging his conviction of the need to construct a European Union. Starting in 1945, Curien read physics at the Ecole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure in Paris, after which he went on to pursue a research career in crystallography (discovering three crystalline forms of gallium, and having a mineral, curienite, named after him). Throughout his subsequent long political career, he continued to work in his laboratory at the University of Pierre and Marie Curie in Paris. Attached to teaching, Curien also maintained his courses at the university until 1994. His talent as a research administrator appeared early, and he quickly rose through the ranks of the CNRS, France's national research agency, becoming its director-general in 1969 and initiating a modernization of the agency. He was one of the founders of the European Science Foundation, based in Strasbourg, and was its first chairman from 1979 to 1984, and from 1994 to 1996 he was president of the board of CERN. Janez Potocnik, the European Union research commissioner, paid tribute to Curien's efforts: \u201cIf something like a scientific Europe exists today, it is in great part thanks to him. He has played a key role in the history of European scientific cooperation.\u201d Curien's destiny as an architect of European space policy was to be shaped by his time as head of France's space agency, the CNES, during 1976\u201384, and his overlapping role as the first chairman of the board of ESA from 1981 to 1984. Curien was concerned that the United States and Russia would dominate the space industry, and believed that Europe had to have its own independent capacity to launch satellites. He and Roy Gibson, ESA's first director-general, persuaded other countries to join ESA by creating the system of \u2018just returns\u2019 for industrial contracts. He oversaw the first launch of Ariane, and decided to create Arianespace. Curien also played a critical role in the creation of ESA's flagship space science programme at a ministerial conference in Rome in 1985. Roger Bonnet, who headed ESA's science division from 1983 to 2001, remembers how, with the conference deadlocked, Curien came back from lunching with ministers opposed to the costs of the new programme with a deal giving it a massive 5% annual increase in budget for the next ten years. \u201cCurien's diplomatic skills had a big effect on the birth of European space science,\u201d says Bonnet. At the same time, Curien launched France into Earth observation with the SPOT series of satellites, and oversaw the setting up of the European Astronaut Corps. Less successful were his dreams for a European space shuttle, Hermes. With the costs of the craft soaring, Curien, in his second spell as science minister from 1988 to 1993, did not hesitate to cancel what had been his own brainchild. Curien oversaw many of the heady days of Europe's fledgling space programme. Following the launch of the first Ariane above the jungle in Guiana in 1979, he and his colleagues celebrated with a tropical snowball fight, using the liquid hydrogen and oxygen dispensed from Ariane's fuel tanks. It was after another successful rocket launch in Kourou that Curien caught the eye of Laurent Fabius. Curien was later to remark, \u201cI climbed onto a barrel to say a few words as was the custom, and was welcomed by thunderous applause... Fabius, who had to create a new government, said that if all it took was for me to climb onto a barrel to be acclaimed, I would be a very popular minister.\u201d Curien oversaw a massive investment in French research by Mitterrand, with spending on science rising from 1.97% of gross domestic product in 1981 to 2.42% in 1992. This and a raft of reforms reorganizing the research agencies were enshrined in a 1982 law on science, which made research a national priority and underpinned a resurgence of French science in the 1980s. Curien was appreciated across the political spectrum, and for example was nominated as chair of the national scientific council of defence in 1986 by the neo-Gaullist government of Jacques Chirac, while at the same time being chairman of a campaign for the re-election of Mitterrand in the poll of 1988. Following Curien's death, Jean-Pierre Raffarin, Chirac's current prime minister, spoke for both the political and scientific communities in France: Curien was, he said, \u201ca man of conviction who knew how to overcome all divisions in the national interest\u201d.

A clearer picture of events is starting to emerge. As the human drama of the Aceh\u2013Andaman earthquake and tsunami unfolded in the last days of 2004, laymen and scientists began scrambling to understand what had caused these gigantic disturbances of Earth's crust and seas. One of the earliest clues was the delineation, within just hours of the mainshock, of a band of large aftershocks arcing 1,300 km from northern Sumatra almost as far as Myanmar (Burma) 1 . This seemed to signal that about 25% of the Sunda megathrust, the great tectonic boundary along which the Australian and Indian plates begin their descent beneath Southeast Asia, had ruptured. In less than a day, however, analyses of seismic \u2018body\u2019 waves 2  were indicating that the length of the rupture was only about 400 km. This early controversy about the length of the megathrust rupture created a gnawing ambiguity about future dangers to populations around the Bay of Bengal. If only 400 km of the great fault had ruptured, large unfailed sections might be poised to deliver another tsunami. If, on the other hand, most of the submarine fault had broken, then the chances of such a disaster were much smaller. In this issue, Ni, Kanamori and Helmberger ( page 582 ) 3  explain why early analyses grossly underestimated the rupture length, and they present an analysis of high-frequency (2\u20134 Hz) seismic signals that clearly shows northward propagation of the rupture for a distance of about 1,200 km. Also in this issue, Stein and Okal ( page 581 ) 4  argue that early estimates of the magnitude 1 , 2  were far too low. Using extremely long-period seismic \u2018normal mode\u2019 waves, they calculate that the earthquake's magnitude was 9.3, about three times larger than initial estimates of 9.0 (given the logarithmic nature of earthquake-magnitude scales). This much larger size is consistent with slip averaging about 13 m along a 1,200-km rupture, assuming that much of the slippage occurred too slowly to be seen in shorter-wavelength seismograms. Thus, they claim the long-versus-short rupture controversy is solved and that there is no need to worry about another giant earthquake and tsunami originating along this long section of the fault. These two reports 3 , 4  are among the first published analyses of what is destined to be one of the most important earthquakes of the century. Over the next year or two, figuring out what happened will be a showcase both of what modern observations and analysis can do and of the multidisciplinary nature of modern earthquake science 5 . In the months ahead, much more will be learned about this giant event. Satellite imagery and field measurements of dramatically uplifted and submerged coastlines ( Fig. 1 ) 6 , 7  and the movement of Global Positioning System geodetic stations 8 , as well as tsunami records, will all add constraints on the areal extent of the rupture and the magnitude and sequencing of slip: these, in turn, will be essential to understanding the tsunami. If all of the megathrust between northernmost Sumatra and Myanmar has produced its once-a-millennium giant earthquake, why should we have any immediate concern about another giant quake or tsunami in the Bay of Bengal? McCloskey  et al . 9  offered one answer by estimating the stresses imposed by the giant 2004 rupture on the two big faults farther south. It seems that the section of the Sunda megathrust immediately to the south, off the coast of northern Sumatra, is now closer to failure. Likewise for the nearest portion of the great San Andreas-like Sumatran fault, which runs through Banda Aceh and down the backbone of the Sumatran mainland. The critical question is how close to failure the 2004 rupture has moved these two big faults. This will be moot until more is known about the history of their past ruptures. It will be necessary to learn how the Sumatran parts of the megathrust are segmented structurally, and how they have behaved in the past. Immediately south of the 2004 rupture, for example, it appears from the historical record that there were very large earthquakes in 1861 and 1907 10 . Where on the megathrust were these ruptures, and how often and how regularly do they recur? Palaeoseismic data are available only for a 700-km-long section farther away, from about 1\u00b0 to 5\u00b0 south of the Equator. Giant earthquakes and tsunamis occur there about every 200\u2013230 years, sometimes as a single giant earthquake, sometimes as two in relatively quick succession, as happened in 1797 and 1833 11 , 12 . Big faults on the northern flank of the 2004 rupture also pose a hazard; the northern extension of the 2004 rupture continues for another 1,000 km, up the west coast of Myanmar, well past Bangladesh to the eastern end of the Himalayas. Too little is known of its long-term history to provide a meaningful assessment of its future behaviour. Moreover, long sections of the enormous thrust fault along which India is diving down beneath the Himalayas have not failed for centuries and are only one to three fault-lengths away from the 2004 rupture. It is sobering to realize that big earthquakes sometimes occur in clusters (for example, seven of the ten giant earthquakes of the twentieth century occurred between 1950 and 1965, and five of these occurred around the northern Pacific margin) 13 . Because many of the giant faults in the Aceh\u2013Andaman neighbourhood have been dormant for a very long time, it is quite plausible that the recent giant earthquake and tsunami may not be the only disastrous twenty-first-century manifestation of the Indian plate's unsteady tectonic journey northward.

These new findings may tie in with an earlier concept of \u2018two-phase\u2019 carcinogenesis. Cancer is often viewed as a genetic disease \u2014 one that results when the DNA sequence of key genes is mutated, leading to the removal of protective roadblocks and/or to the unchecked proliferation of cells. In recent years, however, it has become clear that \u2018epigenetic\u2019 malfunctions can also contribute to cancer development. These malfunctions can be defined as being due to relatively stable changes in gene expression without changes in the DNA sequence of the gene. They are often detected by the chemical addition or removal of methyl or acetyl groups that cause, or signal, a change in the structure of chromatin, the DNA\u2013protein complex that forms chromosomes. When their normal modifying effects on gene expression are deregulated, tumours can arise. Do some of the many \u2018surveillance\u2019 mechanisms that protect us from cancer act at the epigenetic level? One way to approach this problem is to ask whether mechanisms that influence the stringency of maintaining epigenetic modification can modulate the risk of cancer development. In a paper just out in  Science 1 , and in a previous study 2 , Andrew Feinberg and colleagues address this issue. The idea that changes in the epigenetic regulation of gene expression may contribute to the initiation or progression of tumour development was initially viewed with scepticism. But this view has changed radically, particularly in the past decade. Three kinds of frequent epigenetic changes have been identified in tumours. The first is genome-wide hypomethylation, which leads to the activation of many genes that are normally silenced in adult tissues. Second, tumour-suppressor genes can be inactivated by dense hypermethylation of their upstream regulatory sequences, with consequences that are similar to those resulting from inactivation of the same genes through mutation or deletion. Finally, loss of parental imprinting can occur. This is a specific form of epigenetic modification that involves inactivating either the maternally derived or the paternally derived copy of a particular gene in the offspring. Given these findings, it would seem reasonable to suppose that organisms must have ways of keeping tabs on the epigenetic status of DNA, in the same way that other aspects of tumour development can be checked. At least three kinds of tumour surveillance have been firmly established 3 , and their importance is demonstrated by what happens when they break down. The word \u2018surveillance\u2019 was first brought into the cancer field through the \u2018immune surveillance\u2019 hypothesis, which suggested that immune defence mechanisms nip precancerous cells in the bud. Later, however, it turned out that the immune system protects us mainly, if not exclusively, from the growth of potentially neoplastic cells that are initiated by viruses. The main examples include tumours associated with the human papillomaviruses, non-Hodgkin's lymphomas driven by Epstein\u2013Barr virus, and Kaposi's sarcoma associated with human herpesvirus 8. A second, phylogenetically more ancient and more powerful surveillance function is provided by the repair of damaged DNA sequences. The loss or impairment of DNA-repair enzymes is associated with multicancer syndromes. Finally, there is powerful intracellular surveillance, which detects the illegitimate activation of oncogenes (proliferation- driving genes) and can trigger programmed cell death. The crippling of major cell-death pathways is a universal feature of cancer. So, is there also epigenetic surveillance? Feinberg and colleagues' findings 1 , 2  \u2014 which indicate that variations in the stringency of parental imprinting may influence the likelihood of tumour development \u2014 suggest that there is. In their earlier paper 2 , they found that loss of imprinting of the insulin-like growth factor II ( IGF2 ) gene \u2014 a feature of many human cancers \u2014 can be detected in the peripheral blood lymphocyte cells of about 10% of the normal human population. This suggests that the stringency of the postnatal maintenance of  IGF2  imprinting is genetically determined; the authors also found that this 10% of the population has a 3.5\u20135-fold increase in the risk of developing colorectal adenomas; thus, instability of the mechanism for maintaining imprinting is related to the risk of neoplastic disease. In their latest paper 1 , the authors provide experimental evidence that supports their interpretation of the human data, and suggest a possible mechanism. In this study, hybrid mice were generated by crossing two genetically engineered mouse strains. The females used for the cross were heterozygous for a deleted differentially methylated region, or DMR (heterozygosity here means that one of the two copies of the relevant chromosome contained this region, whereas the other did not). Inheritance of this deletion from the mother leads to expression of  IGF2  from both maternally and paternally derived gene copies \u2014 thus corresponding to loss of imprinting. The males entering the hybrid cross came from the Min strain, which carries a mutation in the adenomatous polyposis coli ( APC  gene. Mutations in  APC  provide a strong predisposition to familial colonic polyposis, a precancerous condition in humans and mice. The result of this cross was that all offspring carried the  APC  mutation, but only half of them inherited the imprinting defect. Strikingly, the frequency of intestinal adenomas was twice as high in the mice with the imprinting defect compared with their littermate controls. Also, their intestinal crypts were longer and showed increased staining for proteins that are characteristic of intestinal-cell progenitors. This indicated that the differentiation of these cells to more specialized intestinal cell types was delayed. These observations 1  show, for the first time, that the impairment of normal parental imprinting may interfere with cellular differentiation and thereby increase the probability of cancerous development. Taken together with the data in the earlier paper 2  \u2014 which showed person-to-person differences in the epigenetic silencing of  IGF2  that are related to a predisposition to colon cancer \u2014 the findings indicate that cancer susceptibility may be influenced by differences in the stringency of epigenetic control. This is consistent with earlier work showing that inbred mouse strains may differ in the activity of enzymes involved in DNA methylation 4 . In more general terms, the findings 1 , 2  also show that mutation of a \u2018cancer gene\u2019 ( APC ) and an epigenetically imposed delay in cell differentiation may drive tumour development synergistically. This inference is reminiscent of the early concept of two-phase carcinogenesis \u2014 by \u2018initiation\u2019 and \u2018promotion\u2019 \u2014 advanced by Isaac Berenblum 5 . In general, initiation may correspond to mutation or epigenetic silencing, whereas promotion probably occurs through epigenetic modification. More specifically, Berenblum showed that impairment of differentiation is an essential part of tumour promotion. Feinberg and colleagues' results are consistent with this idea, but they also raise new questions. In particular, it will be necessary to explore the ways in which the loss of imprinting of a tumour-unrelated gene may contribute to the delay in differentiation of a specialized tissue, and influence its predisposition to cancer.

The latest analyses look like settling matters. How, where and when did life start? Geologists are helping to address these questions by diligently searching the oldest-known sedimentary rocks on Earth for traces of primitive life, either in the form of cellular microfossils, or as chemical and isotopic tracers characteristic of biological processes. Since 1996, attention has focused on a small outcrop of supposedly sedimentary rocks, claimed to be more than 3.85 billion years old, on the tiny island of Akilia, just off the west coast of Greenland. These rocks have been too strongly recrystallized in subsequent geological eras by heat and pressure (metamorphism), penetration of deep crustal fluids (metasomatism) and tectonic deformation to preserve fossils. Hence, claims for life there had to be based on the carbon isotope composition of tiny inclusions of graphite (carbon) in grains of apatite (calcium phosphate). Writing in  Geology , Lepland  et al . 1 now report that they cannot substantiate claims for the presence of graphite in any of the crucial Akilia apatite grains. The story began with the publication of two papers 2 , 3 claiming that  13 C isotope depletion (that is, low  13 C/ 12 C ratios) in Akilia graphite supported a biological origin. The host rocks were identified as a banded iron formation (BIF), a chemically precipitated marine sediment normally consisting of alternating bands of iron oxide (magnetite or haematite) and silica (quartz) that might, in principle, harbour remnants of early life. Such rocks are difficult to date directly, but an age of 3.85 billion years or more was claimed from uranium\u2013lead dating of zircon (zirconium silicate) grains in a granitic vein cross-cutting \u2014 and therefore younger than \u2014 the rock that hosted the BIF. This date provided ammunition for the widespread popular claim that life on Earth began around 4 billion years ago. It also implied that earliest life coexisted with devastating global meteorite impacts, known as the Late Heavy Bombardment, which shaped the Moon's surface and, most likely, that of the Earth until about 3.85 billion years ago. Following the appearance of the two papers 2 , 3 , scientific debate commenced in earnest. I myself visited Akilia twice, in company with several participants in the unfolding controversy, but I could not understand why these banded rocks had been identified as BIF. Instead of iron oxide, the dark bands consisted of pyroxene (an alumino-silicate of calcium, magnesium and iron) and resembled igneous rocks from very close by. Genuine BIF occurs in quantity some 150 km to the northeast in the famous Isua region, where the best-preserved 3.7\u20133.8-billion-year-old rocks on Earth occur. The Akilia rocks looked nothing like the Isua BIFs. Detailed chemical and mineralogical evidence soon convinced Fedo and Whitehouse 4  that the rocks were not sediments but strongly metamorphosed, metasomatized and deformed igneous rocks, and thus irrelevant for biology. The zircon uranium\u2013lead date of 3.85 billion years or older for the Akilia rocks was also questioned, because individual zircon grains are complex, possessing zones of quite different ages within a single grain that represent its long and complex crystallization history. The oldest zones indeed gave nearly 3.85 billion years, but this could be an \u2018inherited\u2019 age, older than the age of the host granitic vein, which some claimed to be no more than 3.65 billion years 5 . Other workers 6  then objected that the granitic vein was not cross-cutting at all, but structurally concordant with its adjacent rock. That meant that the measured age of the granitic vein was irrelevant to the crucial Akilia rock, because any previous field relationship between the two had been obliterated by tectonic forces. Even more worrying was the proposal 7  that graphite inclusions in apatite grains resulted from thermal dissociation (at temperatures of about 450 \u00b0C) of iron-rich carbonates in the rock to iron oxide, carbon dioxide and elemental carbon, the latter with a  13 C/ 12 C ratio overlapping values indicative of a biogenic origin. This mechanism was suggested to counter claims for supposedly biogenic carbon in the genuine BIFs from Isua 8 , which often contain iron-rich carbonate. In fact, only one locality now remains in the Isua region where association of graphite with sedimentary rocks leaves the possibility of a biogenic interpretation open 9 . Exchanges between \u2018pro-life\u2019 and \u2018anti-life\u2019 factions on Akilia have now been published for eight years. However, for many observers the ancient Akilia rocks have gradually appeared as less and less plausible domiciles for biogenic tracers. Lepland  et al . 1  investigated many thin sections of Akilia rocks containing apatite crystals by optical and scanning electron microscopy, combined with energy-dispersive spectrometry. This work failed to reveal any graphite inclusions in apatite crystals from the problematic banded rocks or surrounding rocks. Even the most widely discussed sample (known as G91-26), used in the original study 2  proved free of graphite. This persuasive discovery seems an almost inevitable, yet highly problematic, consequence to the increasing scientific doubts about the original claim. We may well ask what exactly was the material originally analysed and reported? What was the apatite grain with supposed graphite inclusions that figured on the covers of learned and popular journals soon after the discovery? These questions must surely be answered and, if necessary, lessons learned for the more effective checking and duplication of spectacular scientific claims from the outset. To my regret, the ancient Greenland rocks have not yet produced any compelling evidence for the existence of life by 3.8 billion years ago. The reader is reminded that another debate on early life is currently in progress on 3.5-billion-year-old rocks in Western Australia, where chains of cell-like structures, long identified as genuine fossils 10 , have recently been downgraded by some workers 11  to the status of artefacts produced by entirely non-biological processes. To have a chance of success, it seems that the search for remnants of earliest life must be carried out on sedimentary rocks that are as old, unmetamorphosed, unmetasomatized and undeformed as possible. That remains easier said than done. For the time being, the many claims for life in the first 2.0\u20132.5 billion years of Earth's history are once again being vigorously debated: true consensus for life's existence seems to be reached only with the bacterial fossils of the 1.9-billion-year-old Gunflint Formation of Ontario 12 .

A particular piece of wood may be avoided because it is too hard or contains defensive chemicals that the termites can't detoxify. Different termite species also vary in their food requirements, and such selectivity may help to reduce competition, allowing different species to coexist in the same habitat. Even wood size matters \u2014 one species may specialize on entire timber-framed buildings, whereas another may have an appetite only for twigs. Theodore A. Evans and colleagues have tackled the problem of how termites assess wood size ( Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA   102,  3732\u20133737; 2005). Worker drywood termites ( Cryptotermes domesticus , pictured) are blind and so cannot judge wood size visually and do not survey the wood physically before starting to eat. The researchers considered another possibility. Termites often communicate with vibrational signals \u2014 soldiers, for example, may drum their heads against the wood to warn of impending danger \u2014 and they are also noisy eaters. Evans  et al . wondered whether termites use vibrations generated during foraging to judge the resonance frequency of the wood, which is related to its size. To test this possibility, they presented hungry worker termites with blocks of wood of different sizes. The workers preferred blocks of a particular size, but this preference could be specifically altered by playing them recordings of termites feeding, or by producing artificially generated vibrations. Remarkably, the vibrational signals also affected reproductive development in the species, suggesting that such signals might play a wider role in termite biology than has been appreciated.

Methanol can be produced by oxidizing methane, the main component of natural gas. But there are no catalysts that can efficiently perform this chemical reaction on an industrial scale at low temperature. Several natural enzymes can carry out the reaction, however. Elsewhere in this issue ( Nature   434 , 177\u2013182; 2005), Raquel L. Lieberman and Amy C. Rosenzweig report the X-ray crystal structure of one of them \u2014 particulate methane monooxygenase (pMMO) from the bacterium  Methylococcus capsulatus . The structure helps to settle years of controversy by revealing that the protein is a cylindrical trimer, with three metal centres in each subunit. Two of the centres contain copper; one centre is mononuclear (containing a single copper ion), whereas the other is dinuclear (with two copper ions in close proximity). The other metal centre contains a zinc atom, which Lieberman and Rosenzweig believe came from the buffer used to crystallize the protein; they think that the natural protein contains either copper or iron at this centre. It is still unclear which of the metal centres is the catalytic site \u2014 it could be any of them, say the authors. However, clues to the answer might come from structural similarities between a subunit of pMMO and cytochrome  c  oxidase subunit II, the terminal enzyme in the respiratory chain, which contains a dinuclear copper centre involved in electron transfer. The dinuclear copper centre of pMMO could likewise be responsible for shuttling electrons to the catalytic site, which may be the nearby mononuclear copper centre. The structure also shows which amino-acid side chains are associated with each metal ion. But much remains to be done. For example, the resolution of the structure is not high enough to determine whether the metal centres contain additional ligands, such as water, that could be functionally important. Nonetheless, the new work is a step along the way to finding out how pMMO works, and towards the long-term goal of developing small-molecule catalysts that might replicate methane-to-methanol conversion in an industrial setting.

Yet James Thomson investigated such a phenomenon 150 years ago, and attributed the cause to gradients in surface tension. Writing in  Physical Review Letters , Yutaka Sumino  et al . now report that this so-called Marangoni effect makes oil droplets perform even more stunning tricks. When placed on a glass substrate submerged in water, the droplets spontaneously climb stairs or loop-the-loop on the inside of a vertical glass hoop (see pictures, in clockwise sequence from top left). The spectacle is driven by the action of surfactant molecules, which attach uniformly to the surface of glass substrates placed in solution, thereby creating a hydrophobic coating. But when the surfactants are next to a droplet, they move from the surface into the oil phase. The resulting local perturbation of the coating makes the surface less hydrophobic, and creates a gradient in the surface tension between the front and rear of the droplet that induces motion. Soon after a droplet has passed by, the surfactant molecules that it has removed are replaced from the solution, returning the substrate to its hydrophobic state. Unlike in other self-running droplet systems, trajectories can therefore cross each other repeatedly. It is this feature that makes the droplet's loop-the-loop possible. It also means that, by using narrow glass strips, the droplets can be forced from random movement into regular back-and-forth motion. All movement stops after a few tens of seconds, however. Sumino  et al . attribute this to the depletion of charged complexes in the oil droplets. As long as they are present, the complexes pair up with surfactant molecules and accelerate them across the oil\u2013water interface. Without this effect, the surface-tension gradient falls below the value needed to drive droplet motion against viscous damping. Reprints and Permissions"},

Robey"}], "parsed_as_year": "2006_or_before", "body": "How does an immature cell know how to develop into a specialized one? A fortunate observation has revealed one of the cues that guide precursor immune cells to their ultimate fate. During the development of multicellular organisms, precursor cells mature into specialized cell types, such as muscle cells or blood cells. This cellular differentiation must be carefully orchestrated to generate the correct numbers and types of cells at the right time and place. Unravelling the regulatory circuitry involved is a major goal of developmental biologists. In a striking illustration of Louis Pasteur's famous statement, \u201cChance favours only the prepared mind\u201d, a fortuitous mutation in a mouse has led Kappes and colleagues to a breakthrough in understanding how immune-cell precursors adopt their appropriate cell fate (He  et al . 1 ,  page 826  of this issue). In the mammalian thymus, precursor cells called thymocytes give rise to two types of mature immune cell: CD4 helper T cells, which alert the immune system when the body is invaded by a pathogen and coordinate an inflammatory response; and CD8 killer T cells, which destroy cells that have been invaded. Each T cell has receptors for a specific antigen on its surface. The gene that encodes these receptors is rearranged during the cell's development to produce one of a huge potential variety of receptor genes. The range of receptors consequently produced by the entire population of mature T cells allows the immune system to recognize virtually any pathogen. These T cells probe other cells they come across, and respond when they find \u2018foreign\u2019 peptides that might signal the presence of a pathogen. The foreign peptides become bound to molecules of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) and are displayed on the surface of invaded cells and other immune cells. The MHC comes in two varieties: class I, which is recognized by the CD8 killer T cells, and class II, which is recognized by the CD4 helper T cells. The CD8 and CD4 proteins aid the interaction between the MHC and the T-cell antigen receptor ( Fig. 1 ). In the thymus, immature T cells express both CD4 and CD8. The cells test whether their newly formed antigen receptors can bind to MHC complexes on thymic epithelial cells that display \u2018self\u2019 peptides, derived from the body's own proteins. Most of the thymocytes fail the test and die. Remarkably, binding to the peptide\u2013MHC complex not only leads to the survival of thymocytes, but also directs them to the appropriate lineage: recognition of class I MHC leads to development of a CD8 T cell, and recognition of class II MHC leads to development of a CD4 T cell ( Fig. 1 ). The work by Kappes and colleagues 1  defines the molecular trail from the thymocyte\u2013MHC interaction to the change in gene expression that guides the cell to its ultimate fate. While screening mice bred from two lines carrying different genetically engineered mutations, the authors noted 2  that some of the progeny had an unusual characteristic that was not the result of either mutation \u2014 a complete absence of mature CD4 T cells. A spontaneous mutation, which they termed \u2018helper deficient\u2019, or HD, was responsible for the defect. Further analysis revealed that HD did not simply cause loss of CD4 cells, but rather produced a \u2018cell-fate switch\u2019 by which thymocytes that would normally have matured into CD4 T cells instead gave rise to CD8 T cells 3 . Although there are a number of engineered mutations that can also redirect the CD4 versus CD8 fate decision (reviewed in refs  4 ,  5 ), most of these mutations lead to proteins that have abnormal functions (rather than causing disruption of a normal function), and thus they may not reflect the true functions of the unmutated genes. Furthermore, most of these engineered mutations cause only a fraction of thymocytes to make the wrong cell-fate choice. HD is the only mutation known that not only is a loss-of-function mutation, but also causes a wholesale conversion of thymocytes from the CD4 to the CD8 lineage, and so it seems to hold the key to understanding this cell-fate decision. Seven years after the original description of the HD mutation, Kappes and colleagues 1  have now identified the gene affected by it. It encodes a transcription factor called Th-POK (for T-helper-inducing POZ/ Kr\u00fcppel factor). Transcription factors regulate gene activity, often in a tissue-specific manner. The discovery, therefore, that the HD mutation changes an amino acid of a transcription factor made perfect sense. The authors also show that, in the thymus, Th-POK is found specifically in mature CD4 T cells, and not in CD8 T cells. Moreover, enforced expression of the Th-POK gene in thymocytes transforms cells that would have been CD8 into CD4 cells, the opposite effect to the HD mutation. Thus, Th-POK is necessary and sufficient to induce the gene-expression programme for a CD4 cell fate and to suppress the CD8 programme. Other transcription factors have been implicated in T-cell development, including GATA3, which is required for CD4 T-cell maturation 6 , 7 , and Runx3, which silences the gene encoding CD4 in CD8 T cells 8 . However, mutation of their corresponding genes does not cause a cell-fate switch, but merely impairs the development of one cell type. So Th-POK seems to be at the top of a gene-regulation hierarchy that controls T-cell fate. Many tantalizing questions remain. What controls expression of the Th-POK gene in developing thymocytes? The observation that Th-POK synthesis is increased in thymocyte precursors that recognize class II MHC, but not class I MHC, implies that the gene's expression is regulated by engagement of class II MHC. This may be controlled by differences in T-cell receptor signalling on recognition of class I compared with class II MHC, as predicted by a popular model for CD4 versus CD8 lineage commitment (reviewed in refs  4 ,  5 ). Further analysis of the regulation of Th-POK by T-cell-receptor signalling will be needed to test this idea. What genes are regulated directly by Th-POK? The gene-expression programmes of CD4 and CD8 cells differ in terms of the production of GATA3, perforin (a T-cell effector protein), and CD4 and CD8 themselves. However, it is not yet clear whether these differences in gene expression are direct or indirect consequences of Th-POK activity. Finally, self-reinforcing feedback loops are often used to \u2018lock in\u2019 cell-fate decisions, and there are hints that Th-POK is part of such a regulatory circuit. HD mice expressing class II MHC, but not class I MHC, show increased synthesis of messenger RNA for Th-POK in thymocyte precursor cells. However, the redirected CD8 T cells that ultimately develop in these mice lack Th-POK. Whether the requirement for Th-POK function to maintain Th-POK gene expression involves auto-regulation of the gene or involves other components of the gene regulatory hierarchy remains to be seen. The quest to understand the CD4 versus CD8 lineage decision has focused mostly on the question of whether MHC recognition instructs the cell-fate decision (the instructive model), or whether cells choose their fate randomly and are then tested for the presence of the appropriate CD4 or CD8 molecule (the stochastic or selection model) 9 , 10 . These models, although useful, assumed that T-cell fate determination occurs as a single discrete step, but it has become clear that it is a multi-step process involving feedback and reinforcement. The identification of Th-POK as a key in the T-cell fate decision should open the way to deeper mechanistic insights into how cells are guided to their destiny. Reprints and Permissions"},

He was not referring to himself. He was an invariably early riser, one who has left an enduring legacy to Swiss \u2014 and European \u2014 science. His contributions to electron microscopy and the genetics of bacterial viruses (phages), as well as his institutional achievements, made him the earliest representative of molecular biology in Switzerland. In many ways, Kellenberger's career was typical of the now-vanishing generation that founded European molecular biology. He studied physics at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich under Paul Scherrer, the most prominent atomic physicist in Switzerland. In 1945, he joined the laboratory of Jean Weigle at the University of Geneva to work on developing a Swiss-made industrial electron microscope. To illustrate the usefulness of such an instrument for biomedical research, Kellenberger attempted to provide micrographs for the sales catalogue. At that time, however, preparation methods were so crude that biological samples were either destroyed by the electron beam or so distorted as to be meaningless. Focusing on bacteria and phages, Kellenberger eventually succeeded in 1958, together with the chemist Antoinette Ryter, in developing the \u2018RK-method\u2019, which went on to become a standard protocol, and their paper a citation classic. The scientific priorities of the atomic age brought many young men and women into physics, but they also pushed some physicists out of the discipline. Weigle, for example, who did not wish to work in the large teams of \u2018big science\u2019, left for the California Institute of Technology in 1948, where he became a phage geneticist, a close collaborator of Max Delbr\u00fcck, the spiritual father of the rapidly growing Phage Group. By returning every year to his former laboratory, then led by Kellenberger, Weigle created a crucial transatlantic bridge, making the Geneva group part of a handful of European researchers working on phage genetics. The scientific reputation of Kellenberger's laboratory resulted from a unique combination of electron microscopy and phage genetics. Unlike many microscopists, or physicists more generally, Kellenberger not only sought instrumental virtuosity but had a deep desire to understand the biological problems at stake, such as the function of genes involved in phage assembly. As a result, in the early 1960s, Kellenberger's laboratory became a central source of phage and bacterial micrographs for molecular biology textbooks. These micrographs also made a strong impression on a broader public, including university and political authorities. Crucially, they gave these key administrators a visual appreciation of the promise of biology at the molecular level. Kellenberger cherished freedom of thought. In his laboratory meetings every idea was welcome, even the apparently naive. His intellectual generosity and respect for the work of others created a relaxed atmosphere that encouraged individual initiative. In 1959, for example, he hired the physicist Werner Arber to investigate the mutagenic effects of X-rays. Two years later, Arber had still not unpacked the X-ray apparatus as he had found himself enmeshed instead in the study of \u2018host-controlled variation\u2019. Rather than pressuring him to move back on track, Kellenberger supported Arber through what appeared to be a highly unfashionable project \u2014 wisely so, as Arber's work eventually led to the discovery of restriction enzymes and to a Nobel prize in 1978. Kellenberger did much to secure molecular biology a place on the science policy agendas, both nationally and at the European level. Until the late 1950s, the term \u2018molecular biology\u2019 enjoyed little currency and was largely undefined. As early as 1959, however, Kellenberger began the planning of an Institute of Molecular Biology at the University of Geneva. In addition to his biophysics laboratory, centred on electron microscopy and phage genetics, Kellenberger conceived of a biochemistry laboratory to be headed by Alfred Tissi\u00e8res, then working with James Watson at Harvard. In his mind, structural, biochemical and genetic approaches were a necessary combination for molecular biological research, a vision shared by an increasing number of scientists around the world. In 1963, the institute was created in Geneva, along the lines of Kellenberger's plan. That same year, Kellenberger took part in the founding of the European Molecular Biology Organization (EMBO) and sat on its first council. EMBO wished to foster molecular biology in Europe, even though it began as nothing more than a club of scientists, without funding. Kellenberger arranged for EMBO to become a legal organization under Swiss law and then directly contacted the Swiss minister of foreign affairs with a letter entitled \u201cWhat is life?\u201d. This must have had an impact, because the minister engaged the Swiss government in taking the delicate diplomatic initiative of bringing European states to support EMBO financially. Once an intergovernmental agreement was reached, EMBO began planning a biology equivalent of CERN, the European particle physics facility \u2014 leading to the opening of the European Molecular Biology Laboratory in Heidelberg. After having spent 25 years at the University of Geneva, interrupted only by occasional sabbaticals in the United States, Kellenberger decided to take up another challenge and, in 1970, helped found a new interdisciplinary research institution at the University of Basel: the Biozentrum. At that time, molecular biology was becoming increasingly established in European institutions, thanks to those, such as Kellenberger, who early on had understood its potential. Kellenberger did not defend science at all cost, however, but was driven by a strong humanist ideal that led him to question the place of atomic energy, and later biotechnology, in society, long before it was fashionable to do so. Until his death on 13 December 2004, Kellenberger was a vigorous proponent of socially responsible globalization, driven by the desire to make knowledge serve the common good. For all this we are profoundly grateful to him. Reprints and Permissions"},

A fact which seems worthy of a note is the length of time during which this snake fasted. The last time the snake fed was June 11, 1904, the meal consisting of a small frog. From that time until the date of its death, February 2, it took no food, although constantly offered it. The animal thus existed for close on eight months without food. During the whole of this time it appeared in good health, and was, at times, most animated. No approach to hibernation was observed, and only for a little more than a week before its death did the snake seem out of health. The body was not unduly thin.

This brings the total since 1938 to eight and is the finest yet, as regards both size and state of preservation, and by far the most interesting because it is the first near-adult female specimen which has come into our hands as well as the first of these precious fishes which anyone has been able to observe alive... Throughout the night \u2014 which the delighted population of Mutsamudu passed in singing and dancing to celebrate the capture \u2014 the C\u0153lacanth was watched over with admirable care by the chef de circonscription, taking turns with his adjoint, M.

It seemed, although quite bewildered at the sequel to its ascent to the surface, to be taking the situation very well, swimming slowly by curious rotating movements of its pectoral fins, while the second dorsal and anal, likewise very mobile, served together with the tail as a rudder. After daybreak it became apparent that the light, and above all the sun itself, was upsetting the animal very much [and] the fish began to show more and more obvious signs of distress... At 14.45 hr. it was still swimming feebly; but at 15.30 hr. it had its belly in the air and only the fins and gill-covers were making agonized movements. From  Nature  26 February 1955.

Stephanou"}], "parsed_as_year": "2006_or_before", "body": "The chemistry of organic aerosols has been somewhat neglected on the assumption that they are eliminated from the atmosphere mainly by rainfall. Laboratory studies indicate that a rethink is called for. Fine particles and droplets suspended in the atmosphere have a key role in environmental issues such as climate and human health. Over the oceans, such aerosols consist mainly of sulphates, but above continents they are mostly organic matter 1 . Organic aerosols come from many sources, including smoke particles from burning fuels and biomass, and the light-induced oxidation of volatile hydrocarbons, both natural and man-made 1 . The main process that removes organic aerosols from the atmosphere has been assumed to be precipitation, but writing in  Geophysical Research Letters  Molina and colleagues 2  suggest that another elimination route could be just as important. Gaseous organic compounds in the atmosphere interact with oxidants such as ozone and hydroxyl and nitrate radicals, reactions that provide an important sink for their eradication from the atmosphere 3 . For organic aerosols, however, the most common means of removal is by deposition, either sedimentation \u2014 simply falling out of the atmosphere \u2014 or precipitation 4 . Organic aerosols are usually less than a micrometre in size 5 , so it is generally assumed 4  that precipitation is the major process by which they leave the atmosphere; larger particles would be more likely to settle out. Molina and colleagues 2  now identify another removal pathway whereby the organic surface on atmospheric particles is degraded by oxidation initiated by hydroxyl radicals (OH \u02d9 ). The efficiency of this process appears to be comparable to precipitation in removing organic aerosols from the atmosphere. To model the reactions that organic aerosols might undergo in the atmosphere, Molina  et al . 2  used two organic films deposited on glass slides: a paraffin film to represent aliphatic aerosols (molecules with carbon chains); and a pyrene film to represent aromatic aerosols (having carbon-ring structures). Aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons such as paraffin and pyrene have been isolated from organic aerosols from various locations 6 . To examine the oxidation reactions of solid organic compounds, the authors exposed the model aerosol surfaces to an \u2018atmosphere\u2019 of various ratios of NO x :O 2 :H 2 O, and then varied the concentration of OH \u02d9  from 0.1\u00d710 8  to 100\u00d710 8  molecules per cm 3  (the average global atmospheric OH \u02d9  concentration 7  is about 10 6  molecules per cm 3 ). Using state-of-the-art analytical instruments, they then measured the rate of degradation of the organic surface, how quickly the OH \u02d9  is used up, and the type and speed of formation of the gaseous products. Molina and colleagues clearly observed the loss of organic carbon from both model substrates. They also observed that, over time, the depletion rate of the organic layer is linearly dependent on the OH \u02d9  concentration. The aromatic carbon surface degraded more slowly than the aliphatic one, suggesting that the route of decay varies according to the compound. The gaseous products of the degradation reaction are small, volatile, one- and two-carbon species; which particular species are produced depends on the substrate. From their observations, the authors propose a mechanism for the OH \u02d9 -induced oxidative degradation of organic aerosols. According to this, the reaction leads predominantly to a scission of the carbon\u2013carbon bond in paraffin, and to cleavage of the aromatic ring in pyrene. The authors assume that the rate of carbon loss from the organic film is directly proportional to the OH \u02d9  concentration, and, given an average OH \u02d9  concentration of 10 6  molecules per cm 3 , they estimate that an aliphatic aerosol of 0.02\u20130.2 \u00b5m will be converted entirely into gaseous products in about six days 2 . The lifetime of an organic aerosol has been estimated from atmospheric measurements and lab experiments to be four to five days 8 . Consequently, this study concludes that oxidative degradation and removal by precipitation occur at comparable rates, and that OH \u02d9 -induced oxidation is a significant mechanism that eliminates organic aerosols from the atmosphere. Chemical reactions with the OH \u02d9  radical have been established as the dominant processes by which most gaseous organic compounds are removed from the atmosphere 3 . In fact, OH \u02d9  reactions occur at environmentally significant rates even for the chemically recalcitrant PCBs (polychlorinated biphenyls), so they are an important atmospheric sink for these pollutants 9 , 10 . However, there is only very limited information on the reactions of gaseous OH \u02d9  with organic liquids and solids 2 , 11 , or indeed on any of the chemistry of organic aerosols. Traditional analytical techniques used to characterize organic aerosols failed to analyse the water-soluble organic compounds (which account for 70\u201390% of the aerosol mass 12 ) and were limited to identifying only the components that could be dissolved in organic solvents (6\u201320% of aerosol mass 12 ). We know now that the water-soluble fraction of total fine particulate aerosol mass contains oxygenated and macromolecular polar organic substances with surface-active properties 12 . But the atmospheric chemistry of these polar species is otherwise relatively unknown and difficult to study. In addition, the association of some species, such as the environmental pollutants polyaromatic hydrocarbons, with black carbon particles seems to show a potential inhibiting effect for their reaction with gaseous OH \u02d9  (ref.  11 ). Molina and colleagues 2  make a strong case that the heterogeneous reactions of organic aerosols with atmospheric oxidants are important for their fate. The results highlight the need for further studies to improve our understanding of the reactions and effects of organic aerosols in the environment. We need a thorough chemical characterization and quantification of the main components, details of their reactions in the presence of atmospheric oxidants, and improved knowledge of their surface properties and water uptake before and after heterogeneous reactions in the atmosphere. Finally, lab experiments are rarely definitive, of course: systematic field studies will also be required. Reprints and Permissions"},

The apparatus was placed between the pole-pieces of an electromagnet, so that the field was parallel to the plane of the plates.

The upper plate, into which the \u03b1 particles were fired, rapidly gained a positive charge... I think these experiments undoubtedly show that the \u03b1 particles do carry a positive charge, and that the previous failures to detect this charge were due to the masking action of the large number of slow-moving electrons emitted from the plates... Since the film of radium bromide is so thin that all the \u03b1 particles escape from its surface, it is easy to deduce from the observed charge from a known weight of radium the total number of \u03b1 particles expelled per second from one gram of radium bromide... a most important constant, for on it depends all calculations to determine the volume of the emanation, and of helium, the heat emission of radium, and also the probable life of radium and the other radio-elements. \n               E.

Two of the ways in which fungi make a living are as saprophytes, drawing sustenance from decaying matter, and as lichens, in which they form an intimate relationship with green algae or photosynthetic bacteria. Evidently, however, a single fungal species can adopt either lifestyle according to circumstance ( New Phytol.   164,  459\u2013465; 2004). Using molecular techniques, Wedin  et al . looked at fungi living on different parts of aspen ( Populus tremula ) in northern Sweden. On analysing four independent genomic markers, they found that three different species of a fungal genus ( Stictis ) grew directly on wood without bark as typical saprophytes (top photograph); but when on the bark of the trunk, the same species associated with green algae to form a whitish, crust-like lichen (bottom). In both images the scale bar is 1 mm. The lichens had hitherto been placed in a separate genus,  Conotrema . Thirty-five years ago it was realized that the fruit bodies of  Stictis  and  Conotrema  are microscopically almost indistinguishable, but  Stictis  was not previously recognized as a lichen-forming genus. That species classified in separate genera are in fact the same organism exhibiting different biologies is a startling discovery. In all three cases, the wood-inhabiting non-lichenized and lichenized specimens were mixed together in phylogenetic trees. Wedin  et al . point out that the ability of a fungus to opt for different nutritional modes means that individual species can exploit a wider range of habitats. If the spores that are shot from the fruits of these fungi land on wood, they establish themselves as saprophytes; if they land on bark where appropriate algae are present, they form lichens. The frequency of this plasticity in lifestyles is unknown. But it may be common, at least in this group of fungi, as the three species able to become optionally lichenized were found on a single species of tree. The study reinforces the case for never treating lichens as anything other than a lifestyle category among the fungi. It also shows the wisdom of the 1959 decision to restrict the scientific names of lichens to the fungal partners; in consequence, the same names can be used for the fungi regardless of their lifestyle.

In theory, the emergence of syntactic communication might have been a comparatively straightforward process. Language does not fossilize \u2014 for all that it was one of the great transitions in evolution 1 , the advent of language has left no obvious equivalent to fossil teeth and bones, and seems inaccessible to enquiry. But it is not hard to imagine the emergence of a set of signals to label objects, the combinatorial nature of which allowed an infinite repertoire of sentences to be constructed from a finite set of words. An essential part of the process must have been the acknowledgement of a set of rules to combine words in such a way as to make sentences meaningful. These rules are the syntax that we all easily learn as children, but students of language evolution have a tough time explaining its origins. So, how did syntax originate? Some authors have conjectured that it resulted from some pre-adaptation of the human brain 2  \u2014 that the first step was the building of a rich lexicon upon a cognitive system predisposed to formulate rules able to exploit the underlying combinatorial features of word associations. According to a study by Ramon Ferrer i Cancho and colleagues 3 , however, a simple word\u2013object association matrix can provide the basis for syntax almost for free. The authors use a simple model in which signals (words) are associated with objects. Such association can be referential (such as  meat  referring to \u2018edible organic matter\u2019) or non-referential ( eat  is associated with \u2018action of eating\u2019). Some words display both associations:  eat , for example, is also linked to \u2018edible organic matter\u2019. A bipartite set of connections is obtained linking the two sets ( Fig. 1a ). Ferrer i Cancho  et al . show that most of the architecture of this network stems from a universal feature common to all languages, Zipf's law. Briefly stated, Zipf's law establishes that if we take all the words in a text and order them by rank, from the most common to the rarest, the frequency (number of appearances) decays inversely with their rank 4 . Most words are rare, whereas a few (such as  the ,  of ,  and ,  to ,  I ) are very common. Common words are less specific and can be linked to many objects, whereas rare ones are more specific and have one or a few links. The number of links of a given word, not surprisingly, follows the same law. This set of linkages does not provide any obvious clue to the origins of syntax. But it allows another network to be built that incorporates a primitive form of word\u2013word association. The new network naturally links names and actions, because pairs such as  eat  and  meat  will be connected. This is simply done: two words will be linked if they share at least one object of reference ( Fig. 1b ). This is of course a very rough way of associating symbols, but, as Ferrer i Cancho  et al . show, the architecture of the resulting network seems to be surprisingly close to many features exhibited by linguistic networks. Previous studies 5  have demonstrated that networks obtained by linking words exhibit seemingly universal patterns of organization, provided the words are syntactically related: two words are linked if they have been syntactically combined in a collection of sentences. Different languages share the same scale-free structure, with most words having few syntactic links and a few of them being connected to many others. Ferrer i Cancho and colleagues' network displays the same structure as its real counterparts. Exactly the same distribution of links is found, suggesting the possibility that early \u2018protolanguage\u2019 might have been ready-made for the development of a full syntax. If this is so, the sometimes illogical and quirky appearance of syntactic rules might be nothing but a by-product of scale-free network architecture. The study also suggests that Zipf's law could have been a precondition for syntax and symbolic communication. Once such a condition was met, the basis for the combinatorial explosion characteristic of human language was ready for selection to shape it. The new theory will be subject to debate, but the remnants of the communicative Big Bang are evidently hiding somewhere inside modern language networks. Reprints and Permissions"},

A great change in the character of the books concerned with the teaching of science has taken place during the last twenty years or so. A quarter of a century ago the claims of science to a place in the school curriculum were being advocated vigorously, and men of science had still to convince reigning school-masters that no education was complete which ignored the growth of natural knowledge and failed to recognise that an acquaintance with the phenomena of nature is necessary to intelligent living. Speaking broadly, it may be said that most classicists even admit now that there are faculties of the human mind which are best developed by practice in observation and experiment. One consequence of the success which has followed the persistent efforts of Huxley and his followers \u2013 to secure in the school an adequate recognition of the educative power of science \u2013 has been that modern books on science teaching are concerned almost entirely with inquiries into the best methods of instructing young people, by means of practical exercises, how to observe accurately and to reason intelligently.

A hundred years later and the trains have reached Lucerne; soon we are well into the age of physiography, that pleasant ill-defined compost which made an agreeable part of the later Victorian education. A further hundred years, and this lively branch of science has given birth to a remarkable variety of new and odd words such as pediplains, steptoes and fluviraption... Progress has been rapid; yet the discussion of the characteristics, origin and development of land-forms will long continue to provide an attractive and challenging mental discipline and a valuable education. Geomorphology not only gives scope for the exploratory and cartographical type of mind but also allows abundant opportunity to increase with time the precision of measurement, examination and analysis.

To describe all the transformations through which a molecule must go during a chemical reaction is a daunting task. The intermediate transition states of a reaction are hard to examine directly, and theory is needed to obtain a full understanding of all the relevant interactions. In 1927, Born and Oppenheimer formulated an \u2018approximation\u2019, which greatly simplified such calculations. Their theory has been crucial to advances in theoretical and chemical physics. It is therefore of great interest when the Born\u2013Oppenheimer approximation breaks down, which may be the case particularly for reactions that take place at surfaces. On  page 503  of this issue 1 , Jason White and colleagues provide the clearest example to date of such a case. The break-up of a chemical bond involves a large bond vibration \u2014 in other words, a large relative motion of the two atoms that make up the bond. Rather than taking into account all the interactions involved, the Born\u2013Oppenheimer approximation treats the motion of atomic nuclei separately from electronic excitation. This is justified by the fact that nuclei are much heavier than electrons and move more slowly. Therefore \u2014 it is assumed \u2014 when nuclei move, as they do during the formation or breaking of a bond, electrons will simply readjust quickly. Many theoretical methods use this approximation, and solve the Schr\u00f6dinger equation (the fundamental equation that describes all such interactions) in terms of electrons moving in slowly changing, stationary frameworks of nuclear arrangements. The result can be visualized as a \u2018potential-energy surface\u2019, which plots the solutions of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation as a function of a molecule's changing structure during a reaction \u2014 a popular method for describing chemical reactions. However, although the Born\u2013Oppenheimer approximation has been widely tested for gas-phase reactions and its limitations are known, the situation for reactions at surfaces is much less clear. In their experiments, White and colleagues 1  prepared nitric oxide molecules in highly excited vibrational states, so that the atoms were subjected to large motion, close to the limit at which the molecules will break up. The excited molecules were scattered from a specially prepared metal surface from which electrons could escape easily. A detector above the surface picked up any electron emission. The experiment's main observation was that when the vibrational energy of the incident nitric oxide molecule exceeded the binding energy of electrons in the surface, electrons were directly emitted from the surface. This finding points to a coupling between nuclear motion and electronic excitation, and therefore indicates that the Born\u2013Oppenheimer approximation is invalid in this case. The research by White  et al . extends work in which electronic excitation was produced at metal surfaces by bombardment with various gas-phase species (mostly atoms such as oxygen, hydrogen and nitrogen, high-kinetic-energy rare gases and some molecules) 2 , 3 . In one of these experiments 3 , electrons in the metal tunnelled through a potential-energy barrier to a semiconductor substrate as a result of the bombardment. The charge flow induced in the semiconductor as a result of the tunnel-ling electrons was termed a \u2018chemicurrent\u2019, to reflect the chemical cause of the electronic excitation. Although these previous results also point to a breakdown of the Born\u2013Oppenheimer approximation, the situation is somewhat harder to interpret because the electronic excitation is most probably mediated by \u2018phonons\u2019 \u2014 vibrational excitations in the substrate itself. White and colleagues' experiment bypasses this poorly defined intermediate step. Experiments of the type presented by White  et al . (and the closely related chemicurrent work 3 ) serve as a warning over the widespread use of potential-energy surface models, and should act as an impetus for modifying the conceptual framework used in surface chemistry. There have been attempts to include electronic excitation in theoretical models, but the task is a daunting one and has been limited by a lack of clear experimental findings. The new experiments provide well-characterized results to guide further theoretical development. Reprints and Permissions"},

These events also provide natural laboratories for physicists investigating the complex interplay of electromagnetic waves and ionized particles in plasmas. And we are not merely passive observers of such phenomena \u2014 we have the capability of manipulating these processes from the ground, as shown to striking effect by Todd R. Pedersen and Elizabeth A. Gerken elsewhere in this issue (  Nature   433 , 498\u2013500; 2005 ). The playground for these luminous processes is the ionosphere \u2014 the ionized upper reach of the atmosphere that stretches from a height of around 100 km to the base of the magnetosphere far above. In Earth's polar regions, the geometry of the geomagnetic field is such that electrons and ions can occasionally be driven down from on high: an aurora (pictured) is the visual manifestation of the collision of these energetic particles with gases in the upper atmosphere and ionosphere. With this basic understanding of the mechanism in place, researchers have shown previously that it is possible to induce such optical processes artificially. By pumping high-power radio waves into the ionosphere (the frequency of the waves being tuned to the local plasma environment), electrons can be locally energized to collide with atmospheric gases in a manner analogous to the natural auroral process. But the resulting optical effects are small, with emission intensities falling well below the detection limit of the human eye. Now Pedersen and Gerken have shown that, if ionospheric conditions are just right, much stronger emissions can be generated by this approach \u2014 so strong, in fact, that they are in principle visible to the naked eye. The \u2018trick\u2019 underlying this demonstration was to choose a time when a natural aurora was already active (previous efforts were directed at quiet regions of the ionosphere). And rather than targeting the main ionospheric layer, the researchers tuned the radio waves to excite a much lower layer, which had been transiently ionized by the inbound charged particles. These observations raise many questions about the processes involved. For example, is an active aurora really a prerequisite for generating such bright emissions, or is it instead largely a picturesque bystander? Should the answer turn out to be the latter, we are left with the tantalizing (some would say disconcerting) possibility that such radio-fuelled emissions could form the basis of a technology for urban lighting, celestial advertising, and more...

Snyder"}], "parsed_as_year": "2006_or_before", "body": "Julius Axelrod, known to friends and colleagues affectionately as \u2018Julie\u2019, died on 29 December 2004, following a career that was highlighted by so many extraordinary discoveries about how drugs act that his place among the twentieth century's greatest biochemical pharmacologists is secure. The research for which he shared the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1970 was only a small, and perhaps not even the most important, part of his opus. Axelrod's life story is an inspiration to those who care about science but lack elaborate academic credentials. The son of a poor basket-maker in New York City, he graduated from the City College of New York and applied to numerous medical schools but was rejected by all of them. For 11 years he worked as a technician in a New York City health laboratory, where he was assigned the task of monitoring the vitamin content of foods. Here he honed his skills in developing simple, sensitive and specific methods for measuring drugs. A turning point was his department's assignment to clarify why phenacetin and acetanilide \u2014 the principal ingredients, along with aspirin, in major headache remedies of the day \u2014 led to dangerously high levels of methaemoglobin, a product of haemoglobin metabolism, in patients' blood. In 1946, he sought the assistance of Bernard Brodie, then at the Goldwater Memorial Hospital, thus commencing a career-transforming collaboration. With Brodie he showed that acetanilide and phenacetin are respectively metabolized to aniline and  p -phenetidin \u2014 the toxic culprits. Another metabolite,  N -acetyl- p -aminophenol or acetaminophen (paracetamol), is probably responsible for the analgesic effects. This discovery, never patented, made up Axelrod's first two publications, and led to the marketing of this metabolite as Tylenol, the world's most widely used analgesic. In 1950, Axelrod moved to the newly formed National Institutes of Health (NIH) in Bethesda. He continued working in Brodie's laboratory but with increasing independence, elucidating the metabolism of caffeine, ephedrine and amphetamine in animals. Although he had never worked with enzymes, he wanted to understand in greater detail how drugs are metabolized, and so incubated various subcellular fractions with amphetamine and ephedrine. Using membrane fractions from the liver, he discovered a previously unknown group of enzymes that require NADPH (the reduced form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate) and molecular oxygen. This is the cytochrome P450 family of drug-metabolizing enzymes, and their discovery represents a classic advance in pharmacology. All of these discoveries were made while Axelrod was only a technician. Responding to pressure from friends, he took a year's leave of absence, enrolled at George Washington University and, at the age of 42, received his PhD. With a doctorate in hand, Axelrod was made head of pharmacology in the laboratory of clinical science at the National Institute of Mental Health. Seymour Kety, the laboratory director, was intrigued by reports that implicated the abnormal metabolism of adrenaline (also known as epinephrine, a neurotransmitter) in schizophrenia. To understand how adrenaline is normally metabolized, Axelrod exploited a brief abstract reporting that adrenaline-producing tumours metabolize adrenaline to a product that is methylated on one of the two hydroxyl groups of its catechol ring. Axelrod soon discovered an enzyme that uses  S -adenosylmethionine to methylate catechols; he dubbed it catechol- O -methyltransferase. Using radiolabelled  S -adenosylmethionine, Axelrod went on to identify several other methyltransferases. These include the adrenal enzyme that generates adrenaline from noradrenaline, and one that forms melatonin, a substance unique to the pineal gland. Kety had set up research wards to compare the metabolism of radiolabelled adrenaline in schizophrenics and normal controls, and provided Axelrod with samples of [ 3 H]adrenaline for metabolic studies. When [ 3 H]adrenaline or [ 3 H]noradrenaline was injected into rats and cats, the radiolabel concentrated in tissues enriched in sympathetic-nerve endings. But lesions of the sympathetic nerves abolished the accumulation. So Axelrod postulated that noradrenaline, the neurotransmitter used by sympathetic nerves, is inactivated by a \u2018re-uptake\u2019 system that involves the transmitter being pumped back into the nerve ending that had released it. Adrenaline, released from the adrenal gland, is also taken up into sympathetic nerves. Neurotransmitter inactivation had previously been thought to be primarily enzymatic, because the first known transmitter, acetylcholine, is inactivated by an enzyme. But it soon became evident that re-uptake inactivation is the rule rather than the exception for most neurotransmitters. Axelrod also found major drugs that inhibit re-uptake, and his discovery that antidepressants work in this way spawned the modern generation of antidepressants, exemplified by fluoxetine (Prozac). For this research he shared the Nobel prize with Ulf van Euler, who established that noradrenaline is a neurotransmitter, and Bernard Katz, who showed that neurotransmitters are stored in synaptic vesicles in nerve endings. Axelrod's gifts as a creative scientist were matched by his gifts as a mentor. His extraordinary discoveries emerged from a tiny laboratory of only three or four scientists. Although he carefully structured concrete projects for new students, he soon weaned them, encouraging independent thinking by the \u201cunconditional positive regard\u201d (to quote psychologist Carl Rogers) that he lavished on every student's efforts. He maintained an active laboratory at the NIH until a few years ago, and subsequently visited his small office there regularly. His wife Sally died in 1992; he is survived by his sons Paul and Fred and three grandchildren. Like almost all of Axelrod's trainees, my entire scientific career was predicated upon the lessons learned in my two years (1963\u201365) with him. Many of us have tried to divine Julie's gift for recognizing important questions that can be addressed by simple means, and for devising experiments so elegantly efficient that, with just 25 test tubes, he could answer four or five important scientific questions. We all have our own ideas about Julie's magic formula, but I suspect he has taken the real answer with him to the grave. Reprints and Permissions"},

They could toss a coin for it, but as they now live apart, how can Bob be sure, if Alice tosses, that she won't lie about the result? In most cryptographic problems of communication between two parties, the challenge is to eliminate third-party eavesdropping. But in the \u2018coin-tossing protocol\u2019, which is relevant to real-world situations such as remote signing of contracts, the issue is a lack of trust between the communicants. Can quantum cryptographic methods stamp out cheating? Yes, they can, say G. Molina-Terriza  et al . ( Phys. Rev. Lett.   94,  040501; 2005). The authors have staged a quantum-optical enactment of a protocol that works as follows. The result is decided by many throws \u2014 the best of 100, say. Alice tosses each coin and encodes the outcome in the angular-momentum quantum state of a photon in an entangled pair. This encoding determines the quantum state of the other photon in the pair, which has been sent to Bob. But Bob cannot determine the state of his photon until Alice sends him the information on her own photon \u2014 in essence, until she tells him how the coin fell. So he bets on the toss, and then Alice sends him a signal encoding the \u2018actual\u2019 outcome, which Bob can verify by performing a measurement on his own photon. Because of its probabilistic nature, some such measurements will fail \u2014 Alice won't be able to encode the true outcome. But the crucial point is that if Alice is systematically cheating, this shows up as a higher than average rate of \u2018failures\u2019, and Alice can do nothing to suppress this tell-tale signature of dishonesty.

This deep-freeze climate would have destroyed most of the budding life that existed before the ensuing Cambrian explosion of organisms. But far from becoming a more hospitable place when the \u2018snowball\u2019 finally thawed after the second episode of glaciation, the Earth was swept by winds close to hurricane strength, according to Philip Allen and Paul Hoffman writing elsewhere in this issue ( Nature   433 , 123\u2013127; 2005 ). The sustained storms whipped up surface waves in the oceans that moulded the sediments in shallower ocean margins into giant sand ripples, much like their smaller cousins found on beaches today. The ancient ripples are preserved in sedimentary rocks around the world, and have crest-to-crest distances of several metres. In comparison, the ripples seen in shallow water today typically measure less than 20 cm in wavelength. The picture shows a characteristic giant wave ripple from Namibia that was created during the rise in sea level after the glaciation 635 million years ago. The hammer handle is 33 cm long.  The steepness and height of the ripples are evidence for winds of at least 72 km per hour over long stretches of sea. The structures must therefore have formed along coasts that were exposed to the swell from the open ocean. But what would be considered a one-off extreme storm today must have been characteristic for the climate of the time, otherwise the waves would not have had time to imprint their signature in the sediments. Allen and Hoffman estimate that the giant ripples formed at depths of 200\u2013400 m, far deeper than the extent of oscillations from surface waves in today's more benign climate. This gives a hint of the profound effect the stormy climate must have had on upper-ocean turbulence and currents. Such violent mixing could have resulted from the contrast between cold continental ice cover and the warmer, increasingly uncovered tropical oceans as the ice sheets retreated. The difference in temperature and consequently air pressure could have produced the inferred prevalence of storms, the giant ripples bearing witness to the power unleashed by a changing climate.

Krause"}], "parsed_as_year": "2006_or_before", "body": "Maclyn McCarty, physician and microbiologist, died of congestive heart failure in New York City on 2 January. He was the last survivor of the three-man team that demonstrated that genes are made of DNA. Previously, most scientists believed that genes must be made of proteins and that DNA lacked the necessary complexity to carry hereditary information. But in 1944, Oswald T. Avery, Colin MacLeod and McCarty published the first paper, in a series of three, that conclusively showed DNA to be the carrier of genetic information. This paper was entitled \u201cStudies on the chemical nature of the substance inducing transformation of pneumococcal types\u201d, and the research crowned a 30-year effort, undertaken in Avery's laboratory at Rockefeller Hospital in New York, to understand and combat pneumococcal pneumonia. The trio's discovery had its origins in the research of an Englishman, Fred Griffith, who in 1928 described the phenomenon of the transformation of pneumococcal types. All of Griffith's work was done  in vivo , by manipulating pneumococcal bacteria in mice. Transformation involved a heritable change in one type of pneumococcus that was induced by a substance extracted from another type. The change was predictable and permanent, and could be transmitted from generation to generation in laboratory-grown organisms. This finding had, in McCarty's phrase, \u201call the earmarks of what we would call today, the transfer of genetic information\u201d. We now know that new microbes and new infectious diseases may emerge as a result of genetic mechanisms in pathogens and selective evolutionary pressures. Yet, strange as it may seem, microbial genetic evolution is a new idea that became established long after scientists understood genetics in plants and animals. So it is no surprise that the 1944 paper was greeted with some scepticism. Nevertheless, the paper had an immediate and profound influence on the thinking and the research direction of many scientists. Frank Macfarlane Burnet, for instance, later wrote, \u201cthe discovery that DNA could transfer genetic information from one pneumococcus to another heralded the opening of the field of molecular biology\u201d. McCarty recounted the history of the discovery in his memoir  The Transforming Principle . According to McCarty's mother, medicine and medical research were his ambition by the time he was ten years old. While in high school, his goal was to enter Johns Hopkins School of Medicine. First at Stanford University, then at Johns Hopkins, McCarty excelled at biochemistry. After medical school he was a paediatric house officer for three years, having selected paediatrics \u201cas the best way to promote my interest in infectious diseases\u201d. Later, following his research on pneumococcal transformation and heredity, McCarty remained at the Rockefeller University and was appointed director of the Laboratory of Streptococcal Infections and Rheumatic Fever \u2014 the latter being a devastating childhood disease at the time. Like Avery, McCarty accepted only several junior colleagues at a time. But we were a privileged few. In an age of big science, McCarty's laboratory was a cottage industry. McCarty used the newly emerging techniques and concepts of cell biology in his approach to streptococcal research, delineating the chemical architecture of these bacterial cells and identifying the major streptococcal antigens as constituents of the cell wall. In great detail, McCarty studied the chemistry of the cell-wall \u2018A carbohydrate\u2019. He surmised that information about the structure of this substance might yield an explanation for the pathogenesis of rheumatic fever. McCarty never put into print his speculation that the immunological crossreactivity between the A carbohydrate and antigens in human connective tissue was related in some way to this pathogenesis. As Avery often said, \u201cstick to the facts\u201d \u2014 and McCarty did. The crossreactivity hypothesis is still not proven, but as McCarty recently noted, \u201cit seemed reasonable to pursue at the time\u201d. From 1954, McCarty and his colleagues began intensive studies on the viruses (bacteriophages) that infect streptococci. All efforts to transform group A streptococci had failed. But there was reason to believe that research on bacteriophages would allow entry into the genetics of streptococci and, in particular, into the genetic basis of the toxic substances they produce and the clinical conditions they cause. That expectation has since been proven correct by numerous investigators. We now know, for example, that bacteriophages carry the genes that encode the toxins responsible for scarlet fever. McCarty's work also helped pave the way for genetics research on many other pathogens, including  Vibrio cholerae  and staphylococci, and to further studies of phage-encoded toxins and other microbiological phenomena. Although McCarty retired in 1981, he continued to go into the laboratory until the end, to discuss research progress with junior colleagues. Retirement also gave him and his wife Marjorie time to travel widely, particularly in France, England and Germany, where they had many friends who treasured their companionship. Often, they rented an apartment in Paris and settled into a daily routine. McCarty read French fluently, but he was reticent about speaking the language. In this regard Marjorie was not so shy, and she would also scan the  Michelin  guide for events that they would attend and for starred restaurants where they would dine. Even in France, dinner was preceded by a Tanqueray Gibson on the rocks. In earlier years, all of us had a Gibson or a gin Martini straight-up. MacLeod related that Avery would announce at the end of a long day in the lab: \u201cNow let's go have \u2018something else\u2019\u201d \u2014 his term for a dry gin Martini. The 1944 paper on pneumococcal transformation begins: \u201cBiologists have long attempted by chemical means to induce in higher organisms predictable and specific changes which thereafter could be transmitted in series as hereditary characters.\u201d All that, and then some, has come to pass: witness the human genome, recombinant DNA technology, and genetically engineered animals that produce complex proteins such as human antibodies.

The latest discovery \u2014 a cellular enzyme that helps to export HIV RNA from the nucleus \u2014 reveals a possible drug target. Gene expression is a multi-step process, the first stage of which is the production of a messenger RNA transcript of a gene. That mRNA is then used as a template to produce a protein. Here, cells whose genetic material is encased in a nucleus (eukaryotic cells) face a problem: their genes are transcribed in the nucleus but proteins are made outside it, in the cytoplasm, so the mRNA must be exported. The same stricture applies to HIV, whose genes, once incorporated into the host genetic material, are likewise transcribed in the nucleus. It is known that the viral protein Rev recruits the cellular export factor Crm1 to export several essential HIV-1 mRNAs 1 . Host mRNAs, by contrast, generally rely on another export factor, the Tap\u2013Nxt1 dimer. But this is not the only requirement \u2014 a \u2018remodelling\u2019 enzyme is also needed 2 . For cellular mRNAs, that enzyme is thought 3 , 4 , 5  to be Dbp5, but this has no role in mRNA export mediated by Rev\u2013Crm1. Writing in  Cell , however, Yedavalli  et al . 6  suggest that the necessary enzyme is a member of the same family. During transcription and processing, eukaryotic mRNAs are loaded with a wide variety of nuclear proteins that regulate the export, cytoplasmic localization, translation and stability of the mRNAs 2 . Although some of these RNA-binding proteins work by remaining associated, at least transiently, with newly exported mRNAs, many others dissociate during or immediately after export. For most cellular mRNAs, this remodelling step is thought to be mediated, at least in part, by Dbp5, an RNA helicase belonging to the ubiquitous DEAD-box protein family 3 , 4 , 5 . DEAD-box helicases use the energy released from the hydrolysis of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to unwind RNA structures and, perhaps more importantly in this context, to dissociate RNA\u2013protein complexes 7 , 8 . These enzymes each bear nine conserved amino-acid motifs, including the eponymous DEAD box itself \u2014 named after the abbreviations for the amino acids aspartic acid, glutamic acid and alanine \u2014 and computer analysis has used these motifs to identify numerous family members in all genomes analysed. The proteins have been proposed to participate in almost every process that involves RNA, including the splicing of precursor mRNAs, the production of the protein-synthesis machinery (ribosomes), mRNA translation, and of course nuclear mRNA export 7 . Dbp5 was first genetically identified in yeast as a primarily cytoplasmic protein, enriched around the nuclear rim, that is essential for the export of cellular mRNAs from the nucleus 3 , 4 . Subsequent analysis 5  of the human protein revealed a specific association with the cytoplasmic side of nuclear pore complexes (NPCs), the large protein assemblies through which molecules go in and out of the nucleus. More recently, evidence obtained in insect cells has revealed that Dbp5 actually shuttles between the nucleus and cytoplasm and, at least in part, assembles onto mRNA\u2013protein complexes (mRNPs) as the mRNAs are being synthesized 9 . Importantly, microinjection of frog eggs with a mutant form of Dbp5 that could no longer hydrolyse ATP blocked the export of cellular mRNAs but did not affect mRNA export mediated by HIV-1 Rev and its cellular cofactor Crm1 (ref.  5 ). Therefore, whereas export of cellular mRNAs by the canonical Tap\u2013Nxt1 pathway depends on Dbp5, the export of very similar viral mRNA substrates through the Rev\u2013Crm1 pathway does not. This finding suggested two possibilities: either nuclear export mediated by Rev\u2013Crm1 doesn't require mRNP remodelling, or it depends on a different RNA helicase. The second hypothesis has now been validated by Yedavalli and colleagues 6 . These authors show that overexpressing another member of the DEAD-box family, DDX3, in cultured human cells specifically enhances Rev\u2013Crm1-dependent, but not Tap\u2013Nxt1-dependent, nuclear mRNA export. Inhibiting DDX3 function selectively impairs the former process. Moreover, DDX3 interacts specifically with both Crm1 and Rev  in vivo . Interestingly, DDX3, like Dbp5, is a nucleocytoplasmic shuttle protein that, at steady state, is predominantly localized at the cytoplasmic face of NPCs. In total, the data indicate that these two helicases, although specific for distinct RNA-export pathways, probably have a similar role in remodelling mRNPs during export ( Fig. 1 ). So what does DDX3, a cellular enzyme, do in uninfected cells? That remains unclear at present. Although Crm1 is essential for the export of HIV-1 mRNAs, it is not known whether it participates in the export of any cellular mRNAs. It does, however, have a well-established role in exporting proteins \u2014 as well as several non-protein-coding RNAs, including ribosomal RNAs 1  \u2014 from the nucleus. Yedavalli  et al . present limited data suggesting that DDX3 is not required for Crm1-mediated protein export. But it might be involved in exporting certain cellular coding or non-coding RNAs. This issue is important, because Yedavalli  et al . 6  also present convincing evidence that DDX3 has an essential, and possibly rate-limiting, role in the HIV-1 life cycle. Thus they suggest that it might represent a new target for chemotherapeutic intervention. However, as cells undoubtedly did not evolve DDX3 solely for the convenience of this virus, it remains possible that inhibiting it could have unforeseen and harmful consequences. It would therefore seem to be a priority to knock down DDX3 expression in infected and uninfected T cells, the major cell type affected by HIV-1, as an initial test of the hypothesis that this helicase is indeed a worthwhile target for antiviral drug development.

His greatest scientific achievement was the invention of the blood-bathed superfusion bioassay technique and its application to a number of seminal discoveries. Vane used to enjoy saying that \u201cbioassay measures biological activity\u201d \u2014 an apparently tautological statement that hides the tremendous potential of the technique. For many years, pharmacological bioassay had been mainly carried out by immersing a piece of tissue in a physiological solution and studying its responses to biologically active agents. This method was taken further by B. Finkelman in the 1930s and J. H. Gaddum in the 1950s, who both developed the idea that a tissue could be superfused rather than bathed in a physiological solution, thereby increasing the sensitivity of the bioassay. In the 1950s, when Vane was a young researcher at The Royal College of Surgeons, he modified the bioassay system so that different tissues could be suspended, one above the other, with the superfusion fluid flowing over each tissue in turn. By doing so, he developed a system whereby the differential sensitivity of three or four tissues gives a unique \u2018fingerprint\u2019 for each substance investigated. Most importantly, this system allowed the immediate detection of previously unrecognized biologically active agents. He also realized that, instead of a physiological solution, blood obtained directly from an animal could be used in an external circulation system for the instantaneous monitoring of the fate of bioactive materials. In the early part of his career, Vane studied the way in which vasoactive substances \u2014 those that cause dilation or contraction of blood vessels \u2014 are handled by the circulation. This led him to propose that the lungs are metabolically active organs involved in controlling the concentration of certain local hormones or \u2018autacoids\u2019. This was a major contribution which spawned a great deal of research around the world. By the early 1970s, Vane's bioassay technique was regularly used in his laboratory to investigate the generation and fate of such agents as catecholamines, bradykinin, angiotensin and, most significantly, prostaglandins \u2014 hormone-like substances, the functions of which are now known to include modulation of vascular tone, inflammation and pain. There was also the intriguing discovery of an ephemeral substance, released from the lungs in anaphylactic shock, which was recognized for its ability to contract rabbit aortic strips and was therefore given the acronym RCS (rabbit aorta-contracting substance). The release of this material was inhibited by aspirin-like drugs. Soon after my arrival in 1971 at The Royal College of Surgeons, Vane invited me to join the project that led to the discovery that aspirin and aspirin-like drugs inhibit prostaglandin biosynthesis. The importance of this finding, undoubtedly Vane's major contribution to biomedicine, cannot be overstated. Besides clarifying the mechanism of action of a drug widely used as an analgesic and anti-inflammatory agent for almost a hundred years, it pointed the way to treatments for various diseases, and opened avenues of research and drug discovery that are still being explored. Notably, in 1974 RCS was identified as thromboxane A 2 , which is derived from the same precursors as prostaglandins: it is released from platelets in the blood and has powerful platelet-aggregating properties. This led to the unravelling of the mechanism of the now well-established anti-thrombotic properties of aspirin and to its successful use in the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular diseases. Vane used to muse that the 1969 experiments on RCS had already indicated aspirin's mechanism of action, because the responses of the tissues detecting prostaglandins were also reduced following aspirin treatment. In 1973, Vane joined the Wellcome Foundation as director of research and development worldwide, and so took on responsibility for more than a thousand scientists. This distanced him from direct involvement in research, and he often complained to me privately about the burden of that job as compared with the delights of being close to the bench. Nevertheless, continuing in his footsteps, his group made further discoveries, significantly that of prostacyclin \u2014 a prostaglandin produced in the walls of blood vessels that acts as a vasodilator and inhibits platelet aggregation. This was a milestone in our understanding of vascular biology. In 1985, Vane left Wellcome and returned to academic life. He then not only rebuilt a successful research team but established what is now a prestigious institute, the William Harvey Research Institute at St Bartholomew's Hospital Medical School in London. Although essentially a shy man, John Vane was charismatic and approachable, with a talent for creating an atmosphere in which intense work was combined with the most enjoyable social occasions. People from all over the world joined the group and were made to feel welcome \u2014 in many cases this led to lifelong friendships. During the years we worked together, some of our most productive discussions and ideas arose at the home of John and his wife Daphne in conversations after lunch or before dinner, or when travelling abroad to meetings. John was an ingenious, hands-on pharmacologist, able to generate meaningful hypotheses almost effortlessly. Although his early training was in chemistry, he developed a great understanding of biological processes and a keen eye for the behaviour of the tissues in his beloved bioassay. One of his favourite phrases to students describing results they did not understand was \u201cthe tissues never lie\u201d \u2014 it is the interpretation that can fail. Together with Bengt Samuelsson and Sune Bergstr\u00f6m, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1982, and received many other accolades. Science in general, and the British Pharmacological Society and his friends and colleagues in particular, have lost a guiding light. Reprints and Permissions"},

Puberty is defined as the period during which the reproductive system matures. It has a clearly defined marker for when it ends: when bone growth ceases. Adolescence, by contrast, is part physiological, part psychological, part social construct. Chronobiologists joke that people suffer adolescence twice \u2014 once themselves, and again when their own children hit the teenage years. But, frustratingly, they have not been able to define precisely when it ends. Till Roenneberg  et al . now provide a suitable marker ( Curr. Biol.   14,  R1038\u2013R1039; 2004). Their questionnaire-based survey of the sleeping habits of 25,000 people between the ages of 10 and 90 confirms the normal distribution of chronotypes in the population: \u2018owls\u2019, who go to sleep late and wake up late; \u2018larks\u2019, who go to bed early and wake early; and those who fall between the two (the majority of people). The authors' survey also shows a remarkably robust relationship of this chronotypology to age (see picture). Children are typically early risers but start to sleep progressively later as they enter adolescence. They reach maximum lateness at around the age of 20, when the curve abruptly starts to decline.

Darwin says of his education at Shrewsbury School:\u2014 \u201cNothing could have been worse for the development of my mind than Dr. Butler's school, as it was strictly classical, nothing else being taught, except a little ancient geography and history\u201d (\u201cLife and Letters,\u201d i., 31).

Mr. Darwin adds:\u2014 \u201cIf the name of Charles Darwin is to be brought into this controversy it must not be used for compulsory Greek, but against it.

One of the main objects of the expedition was to find the nesting habitat of  Picathartes gymnocephala , a rare passerine bird the systematic position of which is obscure; this bird has seldom been seen alive by Europeans. The habitat was found in difficult hilly bush country, and in spite of the dense shade cast by the forest successful films were made of the birds on and near the nests, of the eggs and of the parents feeding the young by regurgitation. Sound records were also obtained of the voices of the birds in their natural surroundings, and a living specimen was captured and brought to London.

Moore"}], "parsed_as_year": "2006_or_before", "body": "Grazing and mechanical mowing can increase plant diversity in grassland, probably by weakening dominant species and so allowing others to thrive. A partially parasitic flower can, it seems, have a similar effect. Diversity is the conservationist's prime goal. Habitats are often evaluated in terms of the variety of different species they can support, and management systems are frequently geared to the enhancement of biodiversity. In the quest for diversity some surprising truths have emerged, such as the fact that predation actually encourages diversity in an ecosystem, and that the seemingly destructive action of mowing can create a grassland sward rich in plant species. The work of Richard Pywell and his associates 1 , published in  Journal of Applied Ecology , reveals that plant parasites are also agents of diversity, and that they too can be used as tools for the management and enrichment of grasslands. When Tansley and Rankin 2  first described the vegetation of British chalkland back in 1911, they appreciated that sheep and rabbit grazing over many centuries had eliminated tree and shrub species from some areas, resulting in the development of species-rich grassland. Using exclosure studies to prevent grazing, Tansley and Adamson 3  later showed that plant diversity declined when the impact of the grazers ceased \u2014 so herbivores, they concluded, have a significant effect on plant diversity. \u2018Predation\u2019 such as this suppresses dominance by robust and productive species, and this frequently leads to the proliferation of less competitive species 4 . It later became clear that the predation\u2013diversity interaction is not confined to herbivores and herbage, but applies at different trophic levels. The value of applying predation to the management of ecosystems in order to enhance diversity immediately became apparent. Grasslands in Britain have lost much of their plant diversity as a result of management for high productivity, and conservationists are keen to reverse this trend of biodiversity loss 5  \u2014 an aim encouraged by European agricultural policy. Grazing by domestic stock can be carefully manipulated to produce the required degree of predatory pressure at the most effective time of year, and this has become a widely used method of grassland management. An even simpler, artificial predation involves mechanical mowing, although, despite the attractions of cost-effectiveness and the avoidance of veterinary care, the outcome is not always as satisfactory as that produced by grazing. The herbivore has dietary preferences and varied techniques in trimming vegetation, and also imposes trampling on the plants and soil \u2014 all of which add to microhabitat diversity. But could there be a third option, namely using parasites instead of predators? The yellow rattle ( Rhinanthus minor ;  Fig. 1 ) has been the focus of research attention in the search for possible parasites. This is an annual plant, regenerating from seed. It parasitizes grasses and clover by means of its roots, but it also has green leaves and conducts photosynthesis, so it is only partially parasitic (it is hemiparasitic). It is reasonable to propose that the nutritional demands that this acquisitive plant places on its robust and productive hosts may reduce their vigour and permit the diversification of other species in the plant community. Experiments in Swiss grasslands 6  have confirmed that  Rhinanthus  does indeed reduce host biomass and enhance biodiversity. But can it be routinely used by conservationists as a management tool? To investigate this question, Pywell and colleagues set up a long-term, randomized block experiment in a species-poor Oxfordshire meadow in 1988; the results of their work have now been published 1 . They sowed the experimental plots with varying quantities of  Rhinanthus  seed, and two years later introduced additional grassland species by sowing with a seed mix of ten common herbaceous plants. After four years, the plots with  Rhinanthus  present were significantly richer in plant species than the control plots in which no  Rhinanthus  had been sown. The original sowing density of the hemiparasite seemed to have little effect on the outcome, because this annual species can rapidly build up its population by seeding. Pywell and colleagues' work has both theoretical and practical implications. Theoretically, it is now clear that parasitism as well as predation can reduce dominance and enhance diversity in an ecosystem. The practical outcome is that grassland managers have a simple and cheap alternative to grazing and mowing. The establishment of the yellow rattle can effectively prepare a meadow to receive a fresh input of seed, and can greatly increase the chances of establishment of new plant species. There is a need for caution, however.  Rhinanthus minor  is toxic to livestock and is very sensitive to heavy grazing 7 . In hay meadows it also needs to shed its seeds in the summer, before the hay is harvested, if it is to maintain a viable population. So those who manage grassland by parasitism will need to ensure that neither mowing nor grazing takes place while the rattle is growing, flowering or setting seed. Reprints and Permissions"},

Improvements in nutrition and sanitation certainly played a major role, but the central factor responsible was the development of childhood vaccines. A particular name can be attached to this achievement \u2014 that of Maurice R. Hilleman. Hilleman ranks with the most brilliant and productive creators of vaccines of all time, with a stature comparable to that of Edward Jenner and Louis Pasteur. But his career was hardly foreseeable. Born in remote Miles City, Montana, as the last of eight children (his mother and twin sister dying during the birth), Hilleman grew up on his uncle's farm, \u201cwhere things got done\u201d \u2014 as Hilleman himself often said. He was later renowned for bringing the same attitude to work in the laboratory. He would never go home before an experiment was finished, and whenever possible was continually driven to translate results in basic or applied research to practical ends. Growing up on a lonely ranch, Hilleman soon became interested in biology. He talked to the farm animals, trying to hypnotize and train them, but eventually discovered Charles Darwin's  Origin of Species . Caught reading this book in church did nothing to enhance his popularity in a community of staunch Lutheran Protestants. Indeed, Hilleman's career almost never got started. When he graduated in 1937, his family had no plans for him to go to college and instead he took a job as a stock boy at a local store. However, one of his older brothers, returning home for the summer, persuaded Hilleman that his talents were being wasted and he enrolled at Montana State University on a scholarship. There, in order to be finished by mid-term, he would often run a semester's worth of organic-chemistry experiments simultaneously. He won a fellowship to the University of Chicago and finished in 1944 with a prizewinning PhD dissertation on the bacterium  Chlamydia . At that time, it was not possible to accurately subtype bacterial or viral families, but Hilleman developed the appropriate techniques by immunizing animals with different isolates and studying antigenic cross-recognition by the resulting antibodies. Hilleman's scientific successes continued when he joined the pharmaceutical company E. R. Squibb in 1944. Because of the danger of Japanese encephalitis in the Pacific offensive during the Second World War, his first challenge was to develop a vaccine against this viral disease. He completed the task within a few months, then cooperated with Nobel laureate Wendell Stanley from The Rockefeller University to develop the first highly immunogenic influenza vaccine with low toxicity. In 1948, Hilleman left industry to concentrate on basic research at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research in Washington. Among many other achievements, he discovered antigenic drift in influenza viruses, the phenomenon by which point mutations allow the virus to evade the full force of the continuously evolving herd immunity. He also discovered antigenic shift, that rare genetic reassortment that can occur during influenza double-infections and that leads to influenza strains against which herd immunity does not yet exist. In 1957, this knowledge allowed Hilleman to warn the US authorities and the World Health Organization (WHO) that an influenza pandemic was about to emerge, a threat that had been overlooked by the WHO. He had noticed a report in  The New York Times  of a severe outbreak of respiratory disease in Hong Kong. Hilleman obtained samples, isolated a new influenza strain and convinced manufacturers to produce 40 million doses of a vaccine. When, as predicted by Hilleman, the new virus reached the United States in September 1957, those at greatest risk were already being immunized. Hilleman's productivity really shifted into high gear after 1957, when he joined Merck Research Laboratories in West Point, Pennsylvania. He was given full responsibility to plan and direct vaccine research and development. During the next 30 years, Hilleman and his co-workers produced more than 40 viral and bacterial vaccines. They developed the concept of combined live virus vaccines, which culminated in the global marketing of the measles\u2013mumps\u2013rubella (MMR) vaccine that is estimated to save the lives of almost two million children each year. Other remarkable vaccines against hepatitis A and hepatitis B followed. His hepatitis B vaccine was also the first anticancer vaccine, as it prevents hepatocellular carcinoma, a consequence of infection. The following episode exemplifies Hilleman's dedication to science. One night in 1963, he was awakened by his little daughter Jeryl Lynn who was sick with a sore throat. He rightly diagnosed mumps, took a throat swab and isolated the virus. This virus strain was then used to develop a vaccine, and Hilleman, assisted by his wife Lorraine, a trained nurse, immunized their second daughter Kirsten in one of the first successful clinical trials. Hilleman's accomplishments in basic and applied research have been of seminal importance to medical biology and human health. They have increasingly received recognition for their insight and ingenuity \u2014 it is no exaggeration to state that they have changed the world. Together with antibiotics such as penicillin, the products of Hilleman's hard work and skill have prevented and continue to prevent the suffering of billions, and the deaths of millions. In acknowledgement of his work, he received many honours and prizes, among them the Albert Lasker Public Service Award and the US National Medal of Science. Hilleman was an indefatigable worker, still publishing and giving seminars until a few weeks before his death on 11 April. He was our godfather in the scientific community: usually quiet, yet precisely intervening and creative in discussions, approachable for youngsters and always helpful, he was our benchmark. His many friends will remember him, as should the whole of mankind. Reprints and Permissions"},

Histone proteins, around which DNA is wrapped to pack it into the nucleus, can be chemically modified in several places by the addition of acetyl or methyl groups. These modifications are reversible and can affect the expression of the associated genes. Cancer cells are known to have unusual patterns of histone modification, but so far work has focused on individual genes and their contribution to cancer development and progression. In contrast, Kurdistani and colleagues looked at global levels of the acetylation or methylation of five different residues in histones H3 and H4 in prostate tumour samples. They used antibodies that were specific for each modification to highlight any differences; for example, the photo here shows a section of low-grade prostate cancer tissue (Gleason score 6) stained with an antibody against dimethylated arginine 3 of histone H4. The authors found, from two independent sets of prostate cancer samples, that histone modification patterns can forecast the risk that a low-grade tumour will recur after surgical removal. How the observed global changes in histone modifications relate to the regulation of genes relevant to prostate cancer development is not known. However, using immunochemistry to detect bulk histone modifications in cancer samples is relatively easy, so these findings could be translated directly into prognostic markers for clinical use.

Full automation, in this sense, does not yet exist, though it may be achieved in a suitable industry before the end of this century. Any technical development that enables a machine or instrument to dispense with labour is a step in this direction; but whereas mechanization has largely displaced physical effort, the new developments are making automatic some of the work that was formerly done by human brains... the implications in respect of leisure and its use [should not] be overlooked... increased productivity is likely to be accompanied by an increase in leisure, and this can only be detrimental to a community that is unprepared or unable to make profitable use of that leisure.

The sequences from  Trypanosoma brucei ,  Trypanosoma cruzi  and  Leishmania major  were published in last week's  Science  by an array of international research teams ( Science   309 ,  416\u2013422 ,  409\u2013415 ,  436\u2013442 ; 2005). In the terminology of global public health, these diseases don't even fall into the category of \u2018neglected diseases\u2019 such as malaria and tuberculosis. Rather, they are classed as \u2018most neglected diseases\u2019 \u2014 which nonetheless kill millions. But those affected have little means of paying for treatment, making drug development unprofitable. Consequently, there are no vaccines, and medicines are few, expensive and usually toxic.  Treatment of sleeping sickness, for example, still relies on melarsoprol, a 50-year-old drug that is ineffective in a third of patients and kills 5% of those who take it. The high rate of fatal reactions is accepted because the disease is otherwise lethal. New therapies are clearly needed, and the availability of the parasite genomes is a step towards finding drug targets and vaccine candidates. The three parasites share around 6,200 \u2018core\u2019 genes, so the proteins these encode might provide targets for drugs that are effective against all three. The parasites make a large and diverse set of kinase and phosphatase enzymes. This means that there could well be regulatory and other processes used by the organisms that could be vulnerable to disruption by drugs. Many species-specific genes were also identified in the genome sequences, providing potential species- and stage-specific targets. Although the three parasites share many subcellular structures, such as kinetoplasts and glycosomes, the organisms are very different. They are spread by different insects, attack different tissues and cause different pathologies. The specimens of  L. major  pictured are in the form that is transmitted to humans by sand flies. Each parasite also has its own mechanism for evading the human immune system:  T. brucei  does not enter its victim's cells, and evades the immune system by constantly changing its main surface proteins;  T. cruzi  holes up inside cells, but uses a similar strategy to hide from the immune system; and  L. major  infects certain immune cells and interferes with their function. Producing effective treatments against these parasites will be a lengthy process, but initial research is already under way by not-for-profit drugs groups such as the Institute for OneWorld Health ( http://www.oneworldhealth.org ) and the Drugs for Neglected Diseases Initiative ( http://www.dndi.org ). The genome sequences will provide such initiatives with a wealth of data and leads. Reprints and Permissions"},

The philosopher Sir Isaiah Berlin once famously quoted a scrap of Archilochus: \u201cThe fox knows many things, but the hedgehog knows one big thing.\u201d Astrophysicist John Bahcall would often introduce himself and a colleague to a new acquaintance with the sentence: \u201cI know all about neutrinos, and my friend here knows about everything else in astrophysics.\u201d Such light-hearted self-deprecation was typical of Bahcall, who died on 17 August 2005. But it was inaccurate: Bahcall's scientific interests and expertise ranged from neutrino physics and the structure of the Sun and other stars, to galaxy models, quasars and the intergalactic medium. His more than 600 scientific publications, on an enormous array of subjects, received nearly 20,000 citations. Many established fundamental paradigms in their fields, and others provided the clearest and most comprehensive overview of them. But Bahcall did, in fact, continually return to one core scientific issue: the solar neutrino problem. He realized very early in his career that we should be able to detect the flux, or stream, of these shadowy fundamental particles as they pass through the Earth after escaping from the centre of the Sun, where they are produced in prodigious numbers. He clearly saw that a definite detection, or non-detection, of these neutrinos would have major implications both for understanding the Sun and for fundamental particle physics. For decades, he encouraged and supported scientists throughout the world in studying this problem and was most successful in his collaboration with Raymond Davis Jr, who ultimately won the Nobel Prize in 2002 for detecting the solar neutrino flux. It was Bahcall's persistent work that proved definitively that the low flux found by the solar neutrino experiments of Davis and others could not be explained by errors in our model for the Sun. Neutrinos seemed to be missing: either they were not made at the rates required by standard nuclear physics, or they were made but then somehow \u2018lost\u2019 in transit between the Sun and the Earth. The latter explanation \u2014 neutrino mixing, in which one type of neutrino changes into another at some rate, and in which the neutrino must have a small but finite mass \u2014 is now known to be true, and it is surely due to Bahcall's tenacity and insight that this important and surprising modification to the standard model of particle physics was uncovered. A fuller idea of his exceptional scientific scope is indicated by the fact that the standard model for a massive black hole surrounded by a cluster of stars is still called the Bahcall\u2013Wolf model; the most widely quoted model for our Galaxy was for decades the Bahcall\u2013Soneira model; and the most accurate models for the solar interior were those developed by Bahcall, with Roger Ulrich, Marc Pinsonneault and others. After completing his graduate education at Harvard in 1961 (having started his university education at Louisiana State University on a tennis scholarship), he arrived at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech), working with Willy Fowler and others at the time and place that \u2018nuclear astrophysics\u2019 was invented. There he became engaged with neutrino work and to Neta Assaf (then completing her PhD at Caltech) \u2014 the two constant loves of his life. His first paper from Caltech, a one-page letter to the editor of the  Astrophysical Journal , dated 1 December 1962 and entitled \u201cThe Solar Neutrino Flux\u201d (authored with Fowler, Icko Iben and Richard Sears), proposed an experiment that might \u201cprovide a valuable experimental limit on the effective temperature for neutrino generation in the sun\u201d. That paper set the course for a lifetime of research. The writing of scientific papers was, however, only one of Bahcall's many contributions to world science. He was an educator who changed the nature of postdoctoral training, and a scientific statesman of unusual and beneficent influence. Bahcall moved to the Institute for Advanced Study (IAS) at Princeton in 1968 and soon established that institution as a magnet and model for postdoctoral training. A significant fraction of the world's most distinguished astrophysicists benefited from his tutelage and the intellectually fertile atmosphere that he established there. The eminent British scientist Sir Martin Rees describes himself as fortunate to have been one of the first IAS postdoctoral fellows in astrophysics in 1969. The birthdays of all the fellows and important family events were celebrated. The intellectual atmosphere was intense, and the weekly Tuesday lunches, with John presiding, to which the whole Princeton physics community was invited, were legendary. Bahcall's postdoc programme was the one that astrophysics institutions worldwide emulated. At the IAS, young scientists were selected and recruited in the most exacting manner and then were free to work on whatever they wanted, with whomever they wished. While maintaining a scientific and educational programme that would have exhausted most, Bahcall also demonstrated extraordinary scientific leadership. He was president of the American Astronomical Association, led the team that produced the 1990 National Research Council \u2018Bahcall Report\u2019 that set the scientific and instrumental priorities for astrophysics in the United States for a decade, and worked (with Lyman Spitzer Jr) with tireless effectiveness in public and in private to have the Hubble Space Telescope and the Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI) built and maintained as one of the world's pre-eminent scientific facilities. Neta Bahcall, a distinguished scientist herself, was his love, his best friend and his scientific colleague throughout. She took a leading scientific role at the STScI and wrote over 30 papers with him on subjects ranging from solar neutrinos to binary X-ray sources. They also collaborated in raising three talented children, Safi, Dan and Orli, who are themselves now establishing significant scientific careers. But no listing of achievements can convey the impression of the man: the wit, the mischievous energy, the passion. Jerry Wasserburg, his old Caltech friend, portrays Bahcall in 1965: \u201cJohn, running around in white tennis shorts, very sportive and competitive in both creative science and tennis, trying out and enthusiastically arguing every new idea in astrophysics; he was the dynamo of the institute.\u201d Reprints and Permissions"}
