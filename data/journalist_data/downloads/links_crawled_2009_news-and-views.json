By B. Anderson \u2014 Everyone knows the dismal sequel to the ambitious scheme for the mechanized production of ground-nuts in East Africa, which was characterized by the failure to employ pedological methods on pedological problems. After the horse had departed, some effort was made to shut the stable door and a very competent soil surveyor was set to work to make a proper study of the soils of the Kongwa and Nachingwea districts. The publication under review presents his results and shows what can be achieved by one trained pedologist working 'on the cheap' with limited facilities, but with specialized technical assistance from various institutions. The moral for would-be planners of land-use is obvious. From  Nature  19 December 1959. \n               100 Years ago \n             It may be of interest to record a fact which has come under my notice while engaged in the development of a uranious mine in Turkestan. The ore is oxidised and calcareous, and contains uranium, vanadium, and copper, radium being present in accordance with Prof. Rutherford's formula, which gives the quantity of it in relation to the uranium. The uranium is on the average 3.8 per cent., but in some places reaches the ratio of 30 per cent. and more ... As I know from the literature of the subject that vanadium and uranium are toxic substances, I instruct the workmen to wash their hands well before going to their dinner and after their work. \u201cWe do this,\u201d they say, \u201cbut at the same time we know that in actual practice a cut on a hand, which lasts for a long time in a coal mine, here, when powdered by the ore, gets well very quickly.\u201d From  Nature  16 December 1909.

Javier Garc\u00eda de Abajo"}], "parsed_as_year": "2006_or_before", "body": "An imaging technique has been demonstrated that blends the principles of conventional light and electron microscopy. It renders images with nanometre and femtosecond space-time resolution. How can we probe light fields in the vicinity of nanostructures? This question is becoming increasingly relevant as the confinement and steering of light at the nanoscale are gathering momentum in applications such as optical sensing and information processing. On  page 902  of this issue, Barwick  et al . 1  provide a practical answer to this question. They report a microscopy technique that probes such fields by focusing both light and electron pulses on the nanostructures under study. In the new imaging technique, which Barwick and colleagues baptized photon-induced near-field electron microscopy (PINEM), a specially designed electron microscope is used to project magnified images of nanostructures in much the same way as an overhead projector forms images of slides from a light beam passing through them. In PINEM, the beam is made of electrons and the role of the slides in the projector is played by light trapped in the vicinity of the samples (see Fig. 4 on page 905). The term 'trapped' means that the light waves do not propagate and decay exponentially in intensity with distance from the sample. Unlike freely propagating light, this trapped light, called an evanescent light field, can interact efficiently with the electrons, which gain or lose energy through the absorption or emission of light quanta (photons). By means of energy-filtering, the microscope subsequently selects and collects only those electrons that have undergone energy gain, forming images in a process that retains the sub-nanometre spatial resolution that is characteristic of conventional transmission electron microscopes. The number of collected electrons is proportional to the strength of the evanescent field. Travelling at 70% of the speed of light, the electrons used by Barwick  et al . 1  spend only a fraction of a femtosecond (1 femtosecond is 10 \u221215  seconds) near their 100-nanometre-thick samples (carbon nanotubes or silver nanowires). To observe a sizeable, and useful, electron\u2013light interaction during such a short time interval requires intense light fields. In their experiment, the authors achieved high-intensity fields by using two synchronized femtosecond light pulses: one of the pulses was directed to the microscope's electron gun, which converted it into an electron pulse via photoemission; the other, with a peak intensity of about 10\u2013100 gigawatts per square centimetre, was aimed at the nanostructure and was capable of producing multiple-photon absorption (or emission) events by each passing electron \u2014 up to eight photons, as the authors report 1 . By design, both pulses have a similar temporal duration, of the order of a few hundred femtoseconds (this duration defines the time resolution of PINEM), and their relative delay in the time of arrival at the sample was controlled with femtosecond precision through the difference in optical path length between the two original light pulses. Light\u2013electron interactions similar to those seen in Barwick and co-workers' experiment have been observed previously \u2014 for example, when electrons pick up thermal phonons (quanta of atomic lattice vibrations) in insulator films 2  or plasmons (quanta of collective oscillations of conduction electrons) from a metal surface 3 , or when electrons interact with evanescent fields reflected from an illuminated diffraction grating 4 . Barwick  et al . are the first to exploit such interactions to image an evanescent light field in the vicinity of a nanostructure, and they accomplish that with nanometre and femtosecond space\u2013time resolution (see Fig. 2 on page 903). Evanescent light fields have been probed previously with near-field optical microscopes 5  that rely on scanning a subwavelength-sized tip over the sample to form images. These microscopes can yield femtosecond time resolution but are limited by the size of the tip to tens of nanometres in spatial resolution. In addition, the tip can produce undesired artefacts in the images. By contrast, Barwick and colleagues' PINEM technique achieves the sub-nanometre spatial resolution that electron microscopes do. What's more, the electrons constitute a relatively 'clean' probe: moderate electron-beam intensities cause only marginal perturbations in the sample, thus allowing faithful imaging. Barwick  et al . demonstrated their PINEM technique for light pulses lasting about 220 femtoseconds, and observed the real-time evolution of the evanescent field that mimics the light pulses themselves. With 220-femtosecond pulses, one could also investigate the dynamics of optical excitations in the sample that have comparable or larger lifetimes, such as certain long-lived photon states that occur in insulating structures (for example, 'Mie modes' in silicon cavities). However, impressive as it is, the technique needs to be adapted for shorter light pulses that can follow the ultrafast dynamical optical response of many nanostructures of interest, such as metallic nanoparticles whose plasmons typically live for only a few tens of femtoseconds. The propagation of light fields along the surface of a nanostructure is a key ingredient of nanophotonic devices, which carry and process optical signals 6 . The PINEM technique could be improved to study such propagation by sampling the evanescent decay of such fields along the direction perpendicular to the sample surface. This and other developments will surely show that, with Barwick and colleagues' electrons gaining energy, the scientific community will also gain new means of observing the nanoworld.

Vitaly Lazarevich Ginzburg, who died on 8 November, played a leading part in many aspects of theoretical physics during the Soviet era and after the dismantling of the Soviet Union in 1991. His research contributions were vast and of the highest order, culminating in the award of the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2003, jointly with Alexei Abrikosov and Anthony Leggett, for pioneering studies in superconductivity and superfluidity.  Ginzburg was born in 1916 into a Jewish family in Moscow just before the Russian Revolution. His formal school education began only at the age of 11. In 1931, Evgeni Bakhmet'ev, a professor at Moscow's Technical University, helped him to get a job as a laboratory assistant in the university's X-ray laboratory. This experience whetted his appetite for physics and he entered Moscow State University in 1933 to study this discipline. Strongly attracted to theoretical physics, he was unsure of his mathematical ability and decided to work in optics under the supervision of Grigory Landsberg. He went on to take his PhD in 1940 and, having transferred to the Lebedev Physical Institute of the Soviet Academy of Sciences (FIAN) in Moscow, completed his science doctorate there in 1942. He was to remain a member of the FIAN for the rest of his life. The scope of Ginzburg's research can be appreciated from his own attempt at a scientific autobiography, in which he listed, roughly chronologically, his range of interests in theoretical physics: classical and quantum electrodynamics, Cherenkov and transition radiation, the propagation of electromagnetic waves in plasma, radio astronomy and synchrotron radiation, cosmic-ray and \u03b3-ray astrophysics, the scattering of light in crystals, the theory of ferroelectrics, and superfluidity and superconductivity. In all of these areas, he wrote prolifically and made original contributions. For example, his work on transition radiation, a phenomenon that occurs when high-speed charged particles cross two media of different electric permittivity, followed on from his deep interest in electrodynamics, and his comprehensive treatment of the topic was truly pioneering. His studies of synchrotron radiation were highly influential in establishing that this process is the dominant non-thermal radiation mechanism in high-energy astrophysical phenomena in radio astronomy. These diverse interests were reflected in a series of influential books. The pinnacle of his scientific achievement was his groundbreaking research with Lev Landau on the theory of superconductivity, published in 1950. This work built on Landau's theory of second-order phase transitions. Ginzburg had already applied Landau theory to ferroelectric phenomena. The crucial advance in the Ginzburg\u2013Landau theory was the concept that, in the transition from the normal to the superconducting state, the phenomenon of symmetry breaking in a metal, a characteristic of Landau theory, was associated with the wavefunction of the metal's superconducting electrons, a non-gauge invariant process. This new paradigm was to have profound implications for many aspects of quantum physics beyond superconductivity, including the Higgs phenomenon, which gives particles mass. His broad interests in theoretical physics were reflected in the famous Ginzburg seminars, which were held each week at the FIAN. Ginzburg stated that the topics for discussion should include all theoretical physics, except particle physics. His leadership at these seminars was impressive: he regularly interrupted the speaker to summarize what had just been said so that all listeners could follow the argument. These were celebrated weekly events, with most of Moscow's physicists making an effort to attend. Ginzburg lived through a turbulent era. The Soviet Union entered the Second World War in 1941, and the Soviet Academy of Sciences was evacuated to Kazan, where Ginzburg worked for the next two years. In 1937, he had married his fellow student Olga Zamsha, but they divorced in 1946. In the same year he married Nina Ermakova, who had been arrested in 1944 on a trumped-up charge of plotting to kill Stalin. She was given a lenient sentence and released under an amnesty in 1945, but was not allowed to return to Moscow. In 1945, Ginzburg was invited to become a visiting professor at the newly established radiophysical department at Gorky University in what is now Yekaterinburg, and he subsequently became chair of a group studying the propagation and radiation of radio waves. Living mainly in Moscow, for seven years Ginzburg made annual applications for his wife to be allowed to return there, but these were refused until after Stalin's death in 1953. In 1947, he was personally attacked in an article in the  Literaturnaya Gazeta , which blamed him for non-patriotic citations in his papers and for 'idealism'. Despite this attack, Igor Tamm, in need of physicists of the highest quality, arranged that he join the Soviet nuclear-weapons programme. The leaders of this project \u2014 Yulii Khariton, Igor Kurchatov and Yakov Zeldovich \u2014 assembled a brilliant team of physicists and mathematicians, including Andrei Sakharov, Israil Gel'fand, Alexander Kompaneets, Landau and Ginzburg, to develop nuclear weapons in response to the United States' development of the atomic and hydrogen bombs. Ginzburg's major contribution was to propose the use of lithium-6 as the fuel for the Soviet hydrogen bomb, a quite different process from that adopted in the United States. But he did not remain long in the nuclear programme. After Stalin's death, Ginzburg was elected a corresponding member of the Soviet Academy of Sciences and his wife returned to Moscow. He became a full member of the academy in 1966 and, on the death of Tamm in 1971, became head of the theoretical physics department at the FIAN. During this period, Sakharov had become politically active and was classed as a dissident, being exiled to Gorky in 1980. The FIAN provided a scientific home for him, but, as a member of the theoretical physics department, this placed significant constraints on Ginzburg, who was not allowed to travel abroad for many years. Matters changed significantly with the period of perestroika that started in 1985, with Ginzburg being appointed a member of the Congress of People's Deputies from 1989 to 1991, when the body was dissolved. Ginzburg was a strong personality, with deeply held humanitarian views that he maintained throughout the years of Soviet rule. He kept an open mind on issues in theoretical physics, but based his opinions on a strongly developed intuition for the underlying principles. He will be remembered with gratitude by all who experienced his kindness, and as an inspirational figure who carried out world-leading research against a background of significant political oppression.

Claude L\u00e9vi-Strauss had only the slightest experience of ethnographic fieldwork, and had no formal training in anthropology. Nevertheless, his ideas transformed the discipline, and profoundly influenced the other human sciences. He died on 31 October.  The son of an artist father, and the grandson of a rabbi in Strasbourg, France, L\u00e9vi-Strauss was educated in law and philosophy at the Sorbonne in Paris. In 1935, he joined a French contingent at the new University of S\u0101o Paulo in Brazil. He embraced the opportunity, because he had a very particular ambition. Jean-Jacques Rousseau once suggested that an expedition should be sent to the Americas to study human nature in its essential state, uncorrupted by civilization. A devotee of Rousseau's philosophy, L\u00e9vi-Strauss was determined to execute the master's plan. During his university holidays, L\u00e9vi-Strauss made expeditions to study remote Amerindian settlements, but almost all of this work was done at telegraph posts where Indians were in contact with government agencies and traders. Only towards the end of his travels did he make brief contact with an isolated band living in the old style, but naturally enough they spoke no Portuguese. \u201cAlas! They were only too savage,\u201d L\u00e9vi-Strauss reported. \u201cThey were as close to me as a reflection in a mirror; I could touch them, but I could not understand them.\u201d This adventure might have been no more than an interlude. But shortly after L\u00e9vi-Strauss returned to France, the German army invaded the country and he became an exile in New York. At a loose end, he wrote up his Brazilian field notes, became an informal member of the anthropology circle at Columbia University and spent long days combing the anthropology shelves in the New York Public Library. \u201cWhat I know of anthropology I learned during those years,\u201d he later remarked. Although his American colleagues were steeped in regional ethnography, they were notoriously suspicious of theoretical abstractions. L\u00e9vi-Strauss, however, was determined to use observations of hunter-gatherers as the basis for a theory of human nature, like a more empirical Rousseau. Such a soaring ambition required a new theoretical framework. Inspiration came from a fellow exile in New York, the Russian linguist Roman Jakobson. Following the path-breaking contributions of Ferdinand de Saussure, linguistics was in the throes of a theoretical revolution. L\u00e9vi-Strauss concluded that it would show the way to a new, generalizing, structural anthropology. Jakobson was particularly interested in phonemics, the branch of linguistics that deals with the communication of meaning through sounds. He claimed to have split the atom of linguistics, the phoneme. The phoneme had been viewed as the smallest significant unit of sound in speech, but according to Jakobson it was itself a bundle of features made up of pairs of contrasting elements. So, for instance, English speakers invest the contrasting b and p sounds with meaning (the words 'bill' and 'pill' are obviously different to our ears), whereas in other languages the distinction may be unmarked and unheard. L\u00e9vi-Strauss argued that systems of classification are constructed on a similar pattern of binary oppositions. Returning to Paris in 1949, L\u00e9vi-Strauss found employment at the Museum of Man and then the \u00c9cole Pratique des Hautes \u00c9tudes at the Sorbonne. His massive doctoral thesis, published that year, argued that the imposition of a taboo on incest marked the break between a natural and a cultural order, obliging men to exchange sisters with other men, and so creating family and kinship networks. In the simplest (and implicitly oldest) systems, these networks are structured by a binary classification of relatives into two classes: unmarriageable kin and marriageable affines. In 1959, L\u00e9vi-Strauss was appointed to a chair at the College of France in Paris. He now began to publish his most influential studies, which dealt with systems of thought.  The Savage Mind  (1962) argued that Native Americans, and other hunter-gatherers from Australia to Africa, operate a \u201clogic of the concrete\u201d \u2014 they order images taken from the world around them in a series of binary oppositions. This home-made natural science provides metaphors for social relationships. In many languages, for example, the Sun and the Moon are associated with male and female characteristics. Paired species of birds and animals are contrasted in terms of colouring, feeding habits, or some other defining features, and are then associated with other paired objects (Australian Aboriginals, for instance, associate the Sun with the crow, and the eaglehawk with the Moon). Such categorizations symbolize the social contrasts between men and women, or between pairs of human clans or occupations. In his masterpiece \u2014 a collection of four volumes on American mythology, beginning with the  The Raw and the Cooked  in 1964 and culminating with  The Naked Man  in 1971 \u2014 L\u00e9vi-Strauss demonstrated how systems of classification are put to work in myths that are at once epics, moral treatises and accounts of the world. He proposed that the initial premises of myths (say, that women are lunar, men solar) are played with in subsequent versions to yield new premises. These transformations follow implicit rules that allow only a sort of logical progression, in the form of the inversion of the initial terms, or a series of substitutions by which one binary pair replaces another. As he put it: \u201cThe kind of logic in mythical thought is as rigorous as that of modern science, and ... the difference lies, not in the quality of the intellectual process, but in the nature of things to which it is applied.\u201d L\u00e9vi-Strauss notoriously claimed that he had a neolithic intelligence, that his thought was intuitively sympathetic to that of hunter-gatherers. His grand theory rested on a binary opposition between nature and culture (taken, of course, from Rousseau), and so between the small-scale, technically simple societies that existed during the first 150,000 years of human history and modern civilization, which rendered the simpler societies obsolete. He believed that humanity in its natural condition was adapted to the environment, whereas civilized societies endanger the environment and obliterate cultural variation. This deeply pessimistic view was conditioned by the Amazonian idyll of his youth, and the European catastrophe of the Second World War that followed. But he also believed that people everywhere ultimately thought in the same way, although about different things, and that the clash of cultures is necessary for human adaptation.

Yet it's commonly thought that dark-coloured alcoholic drinks such as bourbon produce worse hangovers than colourless alternatives such as vodka. Damaris Rohsenow and colleagues now provide experimental evidence of this ( D. J. Rohsenow  et al .  Alcoholism Clin. Exp. Res.  doi:10.1111/j.1530-0277.2009.01116.x; 2009 ). They also find that hangovers caused by these drinks impair performance in tasks requiring both sustained attention and speed, and that the impairment correlates with the severity of the hangover, but not the colour of the drink.  The colours of alcoholic drinks are often due to congeners \u2014 compounds other than alcohol (ethanol) that form during the fermenting process. Bourbon contains 37 times more congeners than vodka, for example. Although the main cause of hangover symptoms is ethanol, congeners are thought to make matters worse. Rohsenow  et al . assessed this theory in a controlled study in which subjects drank vodka or bourbon until their blood alcohol concentration reached an intoxicating level. The intensity of the subjects' hangovers was quantified the next day using a symptom-based scale, and the subjects were given tests to measure their performance in tasks requiring speed and/or sustained concentration. Because alcohol affects the quality and duration of sleep, the authors also monitored these effects in their subjects. Sure enough, bourbon caused worse hangovers than vodka, and all of the subjects experienced lighter, more disturbed sleep after alcohol consumption than they did when given a placebo (decaffeinated cola). But the effects of bourbon on sleep and on next-day performance in tests were no worse than those of vodka. What's more, although the amount of alcohol-induced sleep disturbance correlated with hangover severity, it was not responsible for the effects on performance in the tests. Older subjects, or those dependent on alcohol, might have behaved differently from the young, healthy people who took part in the research.

Perhaps to say that the machine 'composes' is putting the experiments described in this book at too high a level ... Nevertheless, these experiments are amusing and the account of them is well written, so that one does not need to be a  habitu\u00e9  of the computer room to understand what the authors were planning.

It was signed by Prof. McKendrick, and dealt with the vexed question of the blind and their faculties. I am a blind man, and have mixed with blind people of all ages for the past thirty years ... Permit me to thank you for what you say about the popular notion that when a person loses his sight he is compensated by a gift of ability in one, if not all, his other faculties. The intelligent blind know how foolish this idea is, and constantly protest against it ... We are credited with marvellous powers in music, basket-making, &c., and yet when we assert our claim to live the ordinary life of the citizen these people are shocked at our audacity ... My own experience has compelled me to take heed of the varying degrees of what I shall call, for want of a better name, ear-power ...

Perhaps no one better embodies the irony of the cold-war era than Qian Xuesen, also known as Tsien Hsue-shen, the Chinese rocket scientist who died on 31 October at the age of 97. Widely acknowledged for his work on rocket propulsion and his contribution to the US missile programme during the Second World War, Qian was deported at the height of the McCarthyism hysteria on dubious charges of being a communist, only to become the driving force behind China's rise to the first rank of space nations.  Qian was born in the eastern city of Hangzhou in 1911, as China's 2,000-year-old feudal system was overthrown, and he was destined to encounter both turbulent historic events and social upheaval. After graduating from Shanghai Jiao Tong University as an engineer, in 1935 he went to study aeronautics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Cambridge. Theoretically inclined, he was dissatisfied with the practical emphasis that MIT placed on its curricula at the time, and soon moved to the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) in Pasadena. During his time there, he rose to become one of the most prominent rocket scientists in the United States. At Caltech, Qian was the prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of the legendary theoretical aerodynamicist Theodore von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n, and became a renowned theoretician in high-speed flight. The two men were the leading members of a group of rocket experimenters known as the Suicide Squad because of the dangerous nature of their work. In 1939, their research attracted the attention of the US Army Air Corps, which tasked Caltech, including Qian, with developing jet-assisted take-off technology \u2014 a means of helping heavy aircraft to take off by providing additional thrust in the form of small rockets. The 1943 discovery of German rocketry development led to the acceleration of the US missile programme and the creation of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory at Caltech, which appointed Qian as a director. Two years later, Qian received high-grade security clearance from the Pentagon and, as a member of the Scientific Advisory Board, began advising on the latest classified technologies for military development. By 1949, he had laid the theoretical groundwork for a spaceplane with winged rockets, a predecessor of the space shuttle. Meanwhile, Sino\u2013US relations had deteriorated with the onset of the cold war, and this had devastating consequences for Qian's career. In 1950, he was accused of being a communist spy \u2014 allegations that have never been substantiated \u2014 and his security clearance was revoked. Deeply hurt by the accusations, and realizing that he was no longer welcome in the United States, Qian attempted to return to China, whereupon he was arrested and imprisoned by the US Immigration Service for two weeks. He spent the next five years living under partial house arrest, enduring constant humiliation and harassment, although he was able to continue teaching and to conduct limited research at Caltech. He was eventually allowed to leave the United States in 1955, as part of the conditions of China's release of eleven American soldiers captured during the Korean War. Qian received a hero's welcome in China, and was soon asked to create a missile programme \u2014 a daunting challenge in a country where even telephones were luxuries. He began by retraining Chinese scientists and engineers, attracting Western-trained Chinese researchers to return, and building an efficient education and management system for research and development, all of which were to have lasting effects on the country's rocketry development. He joined the Communist Party in 1958 and became a trusted, high-ranking party official. With access to the top Chinese leaders, including Chairman Mao Zedong, he was able to persuade officials to support whatever measures he felt China needed to progress. In 1956, Qian founded the Institute of Mechanics in Beijing, now one of the world's leading aeronautics institutions, and influenced the teaching of engineering at many Chinese universities. Under his leadership, China progressed from copying the intermediate-range Soviet R-2 missile (a version of the V-2 rocket developed by Nazi Germany) to launching Dongfeng-2 in 1964 (a medium-range ballistic missile based on home-grown technology), and successfully tested its first atomic bomb a few months later. China's first nuclear ballistic missile was launched using Dongfeng-2 two years later, and the first Chinese satellite went into orbit using Long March-1, a three-stage space-launch version of Dongfeng-4, in 1970. Qian's endeavours were responsible for the development of the Haiying family of anti-ship missiles, widely known in the West as Silkworms. They also paved the way for a succession of increasingly ambitious space programmes. For example, Shenzhou-5, China's first manned space mission, was launched in 2003, and Chang'e-1, the first Chinese lunar probe, was sent into orbit in 2007, using the Long March family of rockets. It is extraordinary that China's missile and space programmes took off against a backdrop of economic and political turmoil. They were postponed several times during the Great Leap Forward \u2014 a social and economic plan enacted in 1958 that brought the country's economy to a standstill and triggered widespread famine. In an ironic twist of fate, Qian also endured the Cultural Revolution, an 'anti-revolutionary' witch-hunt launched by Mao in 1966. Some of Qian's friends and colleagues were removed from their positions as a result; Qian himself, although largely unaffected, was forced to write letters of 'confession'. Despite the grave injustice Qian suffered in the United States, it is clear that his time at Caltech was one of the most enjoyable periods of his life. He revelled in the great relationship he had with von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n, enjoying his mentor's jokes and their often heated arguments. He also reminisced, with great affection, about the intellectual ethos and creative spirit fostered at Caltech. He contrasted these with China's academic culture and science infrastructure, which he thought had not, and would not, lead to any real scientific innovation. Towards the end of his life, Qian was confined to bed, but he still received regular visits from the Chinese premier Wen Jiabao, with whom he discussed the problems that he felt affected China's scientific development. Although delighted to witness the tremendous advances in the missile and space programmes that he had helped to establish, Qian felt that the intellectual legacy he had brought from Caltech had largely failed to take root in the academic soil of his own country, and this saddened him deeply. Despite his reservations, there is no doubt that he sowed the seeds of change for Chinese science. Reprints and Permissions"},

Reynolds"}], "parsed_as_year": "2006_or_before", "body": "The common skate is not at all common: this large marine fish has 'critically endangered' status. That it turns out to be not one species, but two, is a sharp reminder that good taxonomy must underpin conservation. Conservation biologists who study obscure species in obscure places are faced with the challenge of protecting species they cannot even name. Such taxonomic headaches evidently blight even charismatic species in the best-studied regions of the world \u2014 as reported in  Aquatic Conservation 1 , Samuel Igl\u00e9sias and colleagues have discovered that one of the largest species of fish in the northeast Atlantic is actually two. The common skate,  Dipturus batis , which grows to a length of more than 220 centimetres, and has 'critically endangered' status on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, is really two species with different body sizes, ages at maturity, teeth, fins and eye colour. These fish were once distributed from Iceland to Morocco and the Mediterranean, and until at least the 1950s they were a prominent component of bottom-trawl catches 2 . Since then they have disappeared from large parts of their ranges. In the seas between southwestern Britain and Ireland, for example, only six individuals were taken between 1988 and 1997 during bottom-trawl research surveys 3 , whereas thousands used to be caught accidentally by fisheries using similar gear 2 . French trawlers were still able to catch several hundred tonnes of common skates each year, mainly in deep waters along the edges of the continental shelf in the northeast Atlantic. But behind the scenes, many fisheries scientists wondered how such a large, slowly reproducing fish could sustain these catches. Igl\u00e9sias  et al . 1  have solved the mystery. There are two species, one of which reaches maturity at about 120 cm, the other at 200 cm ( Fig. 1 ). The apparent sustainability of the larger species (one of the biggest skates in the world) was a mirage produced by continued catches of the smaller one, which reaches maturity at a younger age and is almost certainly more productive. Fish-market surveys by Igl\u00e9sias and colleagues suggest that when landings of common skates from 2005 are reassigned to the correct species, only 140 adults were of the larger species, compared with 8,300 adults of the smaller one. The greater rarity of the larger species is consistent with expectations from life-history theory, whereby large-bodied species have lower potential rates of reproduction and are therefore less able to sustain exploitation 4 . We should have seen this coming. In 1926, R. S. Clark 5  stated: \u201cI have noted frequently the occurrence of mature males with large claspers, and other equally large males with the claspers quite undeveloped. So far I have not given any special study to this phenomenon.\u201d A study in 1968 made a similar point 6 . Igl\u00e9sias and colleagues have added numerous other differences, including eye colour, the orientation of tail spines, dorsal-fin spacing, the colour of prominent eyespots on the skate wings, and the shape of the teeth. Indeed, the authors used genetic analyses to show that these two species are not even each other's nearest relatives (the 'near threatened' long-nosed skate,  Dipturus oxyrinchus , sits between them on the evolutionary tree). Formal taxonomic description is still in the works. But these are clearly very different animals in ways that matter greatly to fisheries sustainability, because their different life histories should translate into different rates of population growth 7 . Even before the discovery of this taxonomic lapse, conservation measures for these and many other skates, not to mention their relatives the rays, sharks and chimaeras, have been ineffective. A new European Union (EU) requirement is that common skates when caught should be returned to the sea, but this applies only to the North Sea 8 . And in their last known refuge, the western continental shelf edge, large skates and rays remain unprotected. An overdue step could be to extend the EU regulation to all large skates, including the 'common-skate complex', the long-nosed skate and the white skate ( Rostroraja alba ), across their entire historic distribution. This cautionary taxonomic tale extends, of course, more broadly. In the marine realm alone, a vast store of cryptic biodiversity remains to be discovered. For example, a third of all sharks and rays have been described only in the past 30 years \u2014 a new one is described, on average, every month 9 . Systematics underpins our understanding of biodiversity, both marine and terrestrial, yet taxonomic science is at best underdeveloped and at worst in decline or even in crisis 10 . If the nations of the EU cannot stir themselves to provide an adequate footing for taxonomy and conservation management even for commercially valuable fish, the outlook in less favoured parts of the world is indeed grim.

Tests for the high near-infra-red reflectivity characteristic of many plants have all given negative results. A few terrestrial plants, such as some lichens, do not show this characteristic, and possibly such plants are present on Mars. W. M. Sinton ... has suggested and twice carried out a new test for the presence of vegetation. All organic molecules possess strong absorption bands at wave-lengths near 3.4\u03bc... The radiation received from Mars was analysed theoretically into thermal radiation and reflected solar radiation. The latter shows three absorption bands at 3.43\u03bc, 3.56\u03bc and 3.67\u03bc...

But Diguet and colleagues take a new approach based on the chromocapillary effect, in which light generates a tension gradient at a liquid\u2013liquid interface. This gradient can induce an interfacial flow between droplets and bulk liquids, which propels the droplet in the opposite direction to the gradient. The authors' technique depends on the compound dissolved in the bulk liquid. Diguet  et al . used a surfactant that isomerizes in response to different wavelengths of light \u2014 it adopts a polar isomeric form when illuminated with ultraviolet light, and a less polar form when lit with visible light. The light-induced changes in polarity modulate the surface tension between the surfactant solution and oil droplets floating on its surface. So, when the authors partially illuminated such a droplet with ultraviolet light, the tension gradient caused the droplet to move away from the lit area. If they then partially irradiated the droplet with visible light, the droplet moved towards the lit area. By combining ultraviolet and visible light, Diguet  et al . made a chromocapillary trap that captured oil droplets cast onto the surface of the surfactant solution. The authors could then drag the droplets across the surface of the solution, at speeds of about 300 micrometres per second, simply by moving the trap around. The image above is a montage of superimposed frames from a movie, and shows a droplet (gold colour) being directed by a trap (cyan halo) along a heart-shaped path; the Petri dish is 5.1 centimetres in diameter. Chromocapillary traps should work for various combinations of immiscible liquids, and could thus be useful for controlling droplets in micro- or millifluidic devices. The authors' system could also be used to safely handle dangerous liquids, or in light-responsive materials. Reprints and Permissions"},

In April 1940, as low-flying German planes dropped leaflets over Copenhagen announcing that Denmark was now occupied, a young American on a travelling fellowship at the Carlsberg Laboratories realized that he would have to leave. But that young man, Paul Zamecnik, had already absorbed much from the lab's director, the biochemist Kaj Linderstr\u00f8m-Lang. Back in the United States, Zamecnik's second try for a post with Max Bergmann at the Rockefeller Institute in New York City was successful, and in due course he took charge of his own group at the Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. There he revolutionized the study of protein biosynthesis through the use of a cell-free ( in vitro ) system, thus revealing the enzymatic activation of amino acids, the ribosome as the site of peptide-bond formation and the existence of transfer RNA. Zamecnik died at his home in Boston on 27 October.  Zamecnik grew up in Cleveland, Ohio, and at 16 went to Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire. Graduation from Harvard Medical School in 1936 was followed by an internship back in Cleveland and then a residency at Mass General. His interest in research was apparent early on, as was a strong degree of self-determination. Indeed, even as a medical resident, Zamecnik travelled to New York City to seek a position with Bergmann, who replied that he took only organic chemists. But Zamecnik was prescient to try, for at the time this was virtually the only US laboratory working on protein synthesis. In 1942, Zamecnik returned from the Rockefeller to Mass General, where, under the freedom granted by Joseph Aub, he collaborated on such projects as a study with Fritz Lipmann of the mechanism of \u03b1-toxin produced by  Clostridium  bacteria. But by now, Zamecnik was emerging as a scientific leader in his own right, and a magnet for talent. One to join him was Robert Loftfield. With the recent availability of a long-half-life radioisotope of carbon, Loftfield used the hydrogen-cyanide-based Strecker synthesis to produce the radiolabelled amino acid  14 C-alanine. Employing a cell-free system, and with key contributions by Philip Siekevitz, Zamecnik's group obtained the first definitive data showing protein synthesis in a test tube, including compelling evidence that the labelled amino acid was located internally in the product chain. Soon Mahlon Hoagland joined Zamecnik's group, and using the same system discovered the enzymatic activation of amino acids via the formation of acyl anhydrides with adenylate, conceptually sparked by Hoagland's previous postdoc work with Lipmann, upstairs at Mass General. While Hoagland was working on amino-acid activation, Zamecnik was puzzling over an odd observation in his own experiments. He had seen that  14 C-ATP became covalently bound to endogenous RNA in his system, hinting that RNA synthesis might be occurring (this was well before the discovery of RNA polymerase, the enzyme now known to produce RNA). As a control, he had run a separate reaction with  14 C-valine and observed that it too became attached to RNA before ending up in protein. Hoagland and others in the lab worked through this puzzle and discovered that a low-molecular-weight RNA fraction behaved as an intermediate in the movement of amino acids from their ATP-activated state into protein. This was the discovery of transfer RNA, which had been brilliantly predicted by Francis Crick about two years earlier in a conference talk and an unpublished short manuscript that had not reached the Zamecnik group. Crick was said to be elated by the arrival of hard data, whereas Zamecnik had never considered trusting anything less. In the 1960s, Zamecnik turned his attention to Rous sarcoma virus (RSV), the RNA genome of which is 'reverse transcribed' into DNA for virus replication. His lab started sequencing the region just inside one end, the 3\u2032 end, of the genome. Across the Charles River, at Harvard's main campus, Walter Gilbert and Allan Maxam were sequencing in from the 5\u2032 end using their faster method. The results were soon at hand in both camps \u2014 the sequences at both ends were the same, and had the same polarity. From this it became apparent that, during reverse transcription, the 5\u2032 end of the DNA product strand would be complementary to the template RNA's 5\u2032 end and might form a circle with it. From this, Zamecnik astutely envisaged that blocking circularization might be an antiviral approach. He used a 13-base-long oligodeoxynucleotide complementary to the terminal repeats of RSV to inhibit the translation of viral messenger RNA in a cell-free system and, more momentously, in RSV-infected cells ( Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA   75 , 280\u2013284, 285\u2013288; 1978). These two papers by Zamecnik and M. L. Stephenson launched the era of antisense DNA, which became widely adopted as a powerful tool for experimentally silencing gene expression, almost two decades before the advent of gene silencing by exogenous small interfering RNAs. Meanwhile, commercial efforts began (and continue) to move antisense DNA into clinical application. Zamecnik's many honours included the US National Medal of Science in 1991 and, in 1996, only the second Albert Lasker Award for Special Achievement in Medical Science to be conferred. Shakespeare (whom Zamecnik could quote extensively from memory) wrote in  Hamlet :\u201cWhat a piece of work is a man ... how express and admirable!\u201d Zamecnik was express: he was supremely articulate, and also in a hurry (but too much the gentleman to ever show it). And he was admirable: he always attracted crowds at scientific or social events, not least because of his talent as a storyteller; and as a colleague of his for many years, I often saw him conversing with janitors and other 'sub-faculty' staff, by whom he was held in the same high regard as he was by his scientific peers. He was a most likeable man, a lab-bench perfectionist, and a high-affinity group leader. Medicine, at least on the wards, was not for him, and molecular biology has been the better for that.

An experiment shows that the trapping can be accompanied by a whirling whose direction can be reversed by changing the light intensity. The past few decades have witnessed remarkable progress in the control and manipulation of tiny objects, including micrometre-sized particles, bacteria and DNA molecules. These advances are associated with the development of optical tweezers 1 , 2  \u2014 instruments that use strongly focused laser light to trap objects and move them at will. However, the stiffness of optical tweezers is limited, and an optically trapped particle does not reside at the trap centre but rather wanders about it. Such wandering is a consequence of thermal fluctuations in the particle's surrounding liquid, and is a counterpart of the random motion experienced by free-floating particles \u2014 the Brownian motion explained by Albert Einstein in 1905. Writing in  Physical Review E , Sun  et al . 3  report that the trajectory of an optically trapped colloidal particle in water, although random, can display a complicated but identifiable pattern. The particle's motion is characterized by a circulatory bias \u2014 the streamlines that are obtained by averaging over an ensemble of trajectories exhibit circulation. The authors associate this circulation with a toroidal particle current and call it a Brownian vortex. Interestingly, they find that the overall streamline pattern and the direction of the circulation depend on the intensity of the laser light used to trap the particle, with the possible coexistence of counter-rotating rolls of toroidal current. (A spurious inward spiralling in the streamline pattern was addressed by the authors in an independent study 4 .) Sun and colleagues' observation 3  of a macroscopic flux \u2014 in the form of streamline circulation \u2014 is both interesting in itself and a clear indication that the particle is not at thermal equilibrium. The flux was found in a stationary optical trap, in contrast to the directed motion of Brownian particles seen previously 5  in non-stationary traps, in which a ratchet-like optical potential was periodically modulated in time. The absence of macroscopic fluxes is a fundamental property of classical systems in thermal equilibrium. Such fluxes would dissipate energy through some form of friction, and would decay if there was no energy input from the outside. By contrast, non-equilibrium systems that gain energy from external sources should generally display fluxes. These fluxes can be stationary \u2014 a property compatible with the system as a whole being stationary (with no accumulation of particles, energy and so on) and with the probability distribution of its dynamical variables being independent of time. For optically trapped, transparent colloidal particles in thermal equilibrium, the stationary probability distribution has been studied in detail 6 , 7 . Non-equilibrium, flux-carrying systems can be divided into two classes. One comprises systems characterized by a stationary flux that is sustained by a periodic or constant external driving and does not require fluctuations (thermal or non-thermal) to persist. A well-known physical example of such a system is a laser: once a laser starts radiating in response to external pumping, the primary effect of fluctuations is to reduce the coherence of the laser radiation \u2014 that is, the extent to which the emitted laser light waves are in step with one another decreases. By contrast, in systems belonging to the second class, external driving on its own cannot support a stationary flux; the very occurrence of the flux is due to fluctuations 8 . It is into this second category that the colloidal-particle system studied by Sun and colleagues 3  falls. An insight into the onset of a fluctuation-facilitated flux can be gained by looking at the fluctuation dynamics of a system. In the 1950s, Onsager and Machlup noticed 9  that, for a colloidal particle in thermal equilibrium, the most likely trajectory from the equilibrium position to a given spatial point coincides with the time-reversed most likely path the particle would follow from that point. Therefore, most probably, the particle arrives at a point with a velocity opposite to the one with which it leaves the point. The implication is that there is no net flux. By contrast, the most probable trajectories of non-equilibrium systems, such as that studied by Sun  et al . 3 , lack time-reversal symmetry, and this leads to the onset of a flux. That there is a difference between the most probable trajectories of a non-equilibrium system to and from a given point has been demonstrated both in analogue electrical circuits 10  and experimentally 11 . Sun and colleagues' observation 3  of a stationary flux and its intricate structure for an optically trapped colloidal particle provides insight into the physics of systems away from thermal equilibrium, demonstrating features in their dynamical behaviour that have no analogue in systems in thermal equilibrium. The trajectory-based approach is useful for gaining such insight because of its sensitivity to the dynamics of the system. In the context of optical tweezers and their applications, the experiment raises questions about the nature of the forces to which a particle is subjected in an optical trap and the reason the particle is not in thermal equilibrium.

Their study is an investigation of how the distribution and productivity of giant kelp have changed since the end of the Last Glacial Maximum, about 20,000 years ago, in one of its present-day strongholds, the Southern California Bight ( M. H. Graham  et al .  Proc. R. Soc. B  doi:10.1098/rspb.2009.1664; 2009 ).  The significance of giant kelp ( Macrocystis pyrifera ; pictured) is that it is a foundation species \u2014 a dominant primary producer \u2014 that creates vast submarine forests in coastal areas of temperate regions. These kelp forests constitute ecosystems on which a multitude of other species depend. Delving into the past of marine algae such as kelp poses particular challenges. Unlike the terrestrial flora, for example, there is no pollen record to track a shift in species abundance. Graham  et al . had to find less direct approaches. The authors worked on the assumption that the environmental needs of kelp have not varied over the past 20 millennia. They created 'niche-based' reconstructions through time of factors that primarily included the availability of a rocky sea floor in adequate light conditions, at depths of up to 25 metres. These reconstructions were complemented by palaeo-oceanographic records that allowed estimates of nutrient availability, and so of kelp productivity. The result is a millennial-scale account of the dynamics of southern Californian kelp forests. The patterns are swiftly changing and complex. But the broad picture is of an apparent increase in biomass of three times or so from glacial-maximum levels until about 7,500 years ago, followed by a rapid fall of as much as 70% to today's levels. An archaeological twist comes from a link between the food resources furnished by kelp forests and early human settlements. There is documentation of this for California, and Graham  et al . suggest that past human migrations might also have had a kelp connection. Reprints and Permissions"},

We have made this choice in the hope that providing bread will also give the world peace.\u201d These were the words of the Nobel committee when presenting the 1970 Peace Prize to Norman Borlaug. Borlaug died on 12 September. His brilliance as a plant breeder, and life-long dedication to taking scientific innovations to farmers without delay, were driving forces behind what came to be known as the Green Revolution.  He was born on 25 March 1914, and his upbringing on an Iowa farm and experience of hardship during the early 1930s gave him a first-hand view of the ills of low farm productivity, poverty and hunger. After completing his PhD degree in plant pathology at the University of Minnesota in 1942, he joined the Rockefeller Foundation's agricultural programme in Mexico, which led to the birth of the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT). There he began his work with wheat, with special emphasis on controlling the fungal diseases called rusts. He introduced a multi-pronged approach, including the development of composite varieties of wheat characterized by phenotypic identity but genotypic diversity in resisting different species of the pathogen. Drawing on the availability of the Norin 10 dwarfing gene from Japan, in 1953 Borlaug launched a programme to breed semi-dwarf, high-yielding varieties of wheat that responded well to irrigation and fertilizer application. Traditional wheat varieties are tall, and tend to topple over if grown in highly fertile soil. Conditions for good crop growth are also conducive to the spread of pathogens, however, so he intensified his research on combining high yield potential with disease resistance. Borlaug decided to adopt a 'shuttle' programme that involved growing different generations (F 2 , F 3  and so on) under two diverse conditions \u2014 a summer crop in the cooler highlands near Mexico City and a winter crop in the warmer conditions of Sonora in northwest Mexico. This procedure led to the breeding of semi-dwarf, disease-resistant wheat strains with broad adaptation, such as Sonora 63, Sonora 64, Lerma Rojo 64 and Mayo 64. These were varieties with a yield potential of 5\u20136 tonnes per hectare that in the 1960s transformed wheat productivity in Mexico, then in India and Pakistan. In 1966, in a strategy supported by Borlaug, India imported 18,000 tonnes of seeds of Lerma Rojo 64-A and a few other varieties from Mexico. The result was a jump in wheat production from 12 million tonnes in 1965 to 17 million tonnes in 1968. Similar results were obtained in rice, as a result of the introduction of the Dee-gee-woo-gen dwarfing gene from China into tall varieties of  indica  rice at the International Rice Research Institute in the Philippines. This Green Revolution, a term coined in 1968 by William Gaud, remains an astonishing phenomenon that not only boosts productivity but also saves land resources. For example, in 2009 India produced 80 million tonnes of wheat from 26 million hectares of land. At pre-Green Revolution yield levels, 80 million hectares would have been needed. Africa, however, did not witness the same success. Beginning in 1986, Borlaug organized a programme known as Sasakawa-Global 2000, in which numerous small-scale farmers were helped to double and triple their yield of maize (corn), rice, sorghum, millet, wheat, cassava and grain legumes. Unfortunately, the spectacular results in demonstration plots were not reflected at the national level owing to the lack of effective systems of irrigation, roads, seed production, remunerative marketing and other elements of infrastructure. In 1984, Borlaug accepted a part-time professorship at Texas A&M University, where for more than 15 years he taught a graduate course in international agriculture. Aware of the lack of recognition for scientists working in food and agriculture, he had the World Food Prize established in 1986, which he hoped would come to be regarded as the Nobel prize for these subjects. Throughout his career, he devoted time to training young scholars and researchers. This led him to promote the World Food Prize Youth Institute programme, which helps high-school students to work in other countries, a life-changing experience for them. Borlaug's seminal research involved traditional breeding methods, but he was a great supporter of biotechnology research, including the use of recombinant DNA technology. He believed firmly in exploiting the new opportunities for creating novel genetic combinations to meet the challenges arising from climate change. He was also an advocate of 'public good' research, and argued for the free exchange of genetic material and the continuous development of germ plasm by approaches such as hybridization between winter and spring wheats. In 2006, the Norman Borlaug Institute for International Agriculture was set up at Texas A&M to promote science-based solutions for the challenges facing global agriculture. Norman Borlaug was a remarkable man who was supported by a remarkable woman, his wife Margaret, who died in 2007. To my mind she is the unsung heroine of the Green Revolution: without her unwavering support, Borlaug might not have accomplished nearly so much in his long and demanding career. He is survived by a daughter and a son. Towards the end of his life, he received two especially notable honours. In 2004, to mark his youthful prowess as a wrestler, he was inducted into the Iowa Wrestling Hall of Fame. And in 2007 he was awarded the Congressional Gold Medal. On that occasion he pointed out that between the years 1960 and 2000 the proportion of \u201cthe world's people who felt hunger during some portion of the year\u201d had fallen from perhaps 60% to about 14%. The latter figure, he went on, still \u201ctranslates to 850 million men, women and children who lack sufficient calories and protein to grow strong and healthy bodies\u201d, and that \u201cthe battle to ensure food security for hundreds of millions of miserably poor people is far from won\u201d. This is the unfinished task that Norman Borlaug leaves to scientists and political leaders worldwide. Reprints and Permissions"},

By Hubert Martin \u2014 To say that, nuclear wars apart, the greatest problem of the future will be to feed the rapidly growing human population is none the less true for being trite. Happily there is no need to think it is insoluble. Average crop yields are so low that the scope for improvement is enormous, and starvation can be avoided for a long time simply by improving the health of crops. Over much of the world most crops are left to fend for themselves, unaided in their struggle with pests and diseases. What annual toll these predators take cannot be estimated at all accurately, but there is little doubt that human beings will have at least twice as much to eat when they stop sharing their crops with pests and diseases. \n               ALSO: \n             Prof. Jaroslav Heyrovsky...has been awarded the Nobel Prize for Chemistry for 1959, for his discovery and development of polarography...The number of papers dealing with polarography now approaches the 10,000 mark, and the technique finds application in many fields of chemistry and biochemistry...For example, the kinetics of electrode reactions and of chemical reactions associated with redox processes have been studied, redox potentials have been determined and the energetics of the reduction of organic compounds have been elucidated.

A. Birstein ( Priroda ,  5 , 21; 1959). It is based partly on the work published in the Soviet Union and it leads to certain new ideas regarding the origin of the deep sea fauna. Thus the author of this review is casting doubt upon the conclusions of C. Emiliani and C. Edwards ... regarding the sharp changes of sea temperatures during the late Tertiary era, and also about those of A. Fr. Bruun ... regarding the extinction of the deep sea fauna. According to the author all the deep oceanic regions must be considered to be regions of a relatively constant temperature, affording a place of refuge to many animal species which have eventually died out in the waters of a lesser depth.

This must, of course, depend in a large measure upon the diameter of their glasses and on their powers of vision. After the present moon has left the sky, say during the second week in October, the comet ought to have increased in light sufficiently for it to be observed in a 12-inch telescope. The calculated magnitude of the comet will be 141/2 on October 15, and its distance from the earth about 230 millions of miles ... The comet will be visible in an excellent position nearly all night during most of the winter, but will continue small and faint until it blazes out next April. From  Nature  30 September 1909.

All stimuli then produce engrams, and the sum of the engrams of a living being is its mneme ... Thus a stimulus may produce effects which radiate from the organised matter first affected to organised matter throughout the whole organism, either by nerve paths or by proplasmic intercellular filaments, and in this way faint engrams may be made on the matter of the reproductive elements, ova or spermatozoids.

Contrary to conventional wisdom, beyond a critical charge, the drops fail to merge. Just as we may be guided by a sense of 'more is more' in our daily lives, so physicists often use this principle as a good first guess to explain physical phenomena. For example, in a situation as simple as two objects with electrically opposite charges, the expectation is that the more strongly charged the objects are, the more they should attract each other. In the case of liquid drops, we would expect them to bump into each other and coalesce into one larger drop, and that, the higher their charge, the quicker this would happen. It seems that the simpler a situation is, the more stunned we are if nature 'refuses' to follow our expectations. Such a refusal is exactly what Ristenpart  et al . 1  find in experiments described on  page 377  of this issue. Counter-intuitively, the authors show that two oppositely charged drops bounce off each other and do not coalesce if their charge exceeds a threshold value. Ristenpart and colleagues' experiment 1  is simple. A millimetre-sized water drop immersed in a beaker filled with oil becomes positively charged when brought into contact with a metal wire at high voltage. A second, much bigger drop, covering the bottom of the beaker, is kept at ground voltage and becomes negatively charged. The resulting electric field pulls the small drop towards the big one. For low to moderate electric-field strengths, or equivalently for low drop charges, the small drop is attracted towards the large one, deforms, touches and coalesces with it. For high field strengths, and beyond a critical value, the droplet is still attracted towards the larger drop and deforms on approaching it, but instead of coalescing, it bounces off and moves away towards the wire. The authors 1  show that this phenomenon is independent of the fluids involved in the process: the non-coalescence behaviour occurs for clean water drops in silicone oil, brine drops in crude oil, vinegar drops in olive oil, and water drops in air. Under suitable conditions, the small drop can even shuttle back and forth several times between the wire and the big drop. This effect is similar to the to-and-fro motion that small scraps of paper or Styrofoam experience when placed between the two electrodes of a high-voltage generator, and is usually demonstrated in first-year undergraduate laboratory experiments on electrostatics. To understand the non-coalescence of oppositely charged drops, Ristenpart  et al . used high-speed video microscopy to record drop motion right at the moment of coalescence/non-coalescence. By doing so, they found that all drops, irrespective of their charge, established contact by forming a microscopic capillary bridge. But whereas for low-charge drops the bridge remained stable and sucked the small drop into the big one, for high-charge drops it broke up in less than a millisecond. One of the beauties of Ristenpart and colleagues' work 1  is that it provides a simple and convincing explanation for the observed phenomenon. As long as the drops are apart, electrostatic forces pull their surfaces towards each other, producing conically shaped protrusions known as Taylor cones 2  at the drops' leading edges. But as soon as the capillary bridge is formed, the two drops are immediately electrically short-circuited and hence all electrostatic forces vanish abruptly. From that moment on, the surface tension of the drops in combination with the geometry of the Taylor cones determines the fate of the capillary bridge. For low-charge drops, the cones are blunt and hydrodynamically stable. They grow and suck the small drop into the big one. For high-charge drops, the cones are sharper and unstable. As a result, they break and the drops bounce off each other. The coalescence/non-coalescence phenomenon is thus a consequence of the geometry of the Taylor cones initially formed under the influence of the electric field and the subsequent sudden vanishing of the electrostatic forces ( Fig. 1 ). Interestingly, Ristenpart  et al . find that the threshold charge for non-coalescence increases for very low salt concentrations in water \u2014 that is, for poorly conducting water. Such conductivity dependence has also been observed in other electrohydrodynamic phenomena, including the emission of jets and drops from Taylor cones 3  and the periodic detachment and reattachment of sessile liquid drops from a wire through the application of a voltage 4 . The latter experiment 4  explains the conductivity dependence in terms of the increasing electrical resistivity during the break-up of the capillary bridge, and might well help to explain Ristenpart and co-workers' observations at low salt concentrations. What will be the impact of Ristenpart and colleagues' work 1 ? Their observation of the counter-intuitive, non-coalescing behaviour of charged liquid drops doesn't have an immediate link to a specific scientific problem or technological application. However, given the general validity of the phenomenon for any liquid\u2013liquid or liquid\u2013gas system, their study will provide insights into our understanding of a variety of well-known physical problems that involve drops in electric fields. For example, it should further our understanding of electrocoalescence-based de-emulsification processes that are widely used to separate residual water from crude oil. Moreover, it should help to explain the long-standing problem of cloud electrification in thunderstorms, which was addressed by Lord Rayleigh 5  and Geoffrey Taylor 2  in their seminal contributions to the field of electrohydrodynamics.

M. Feazel  et al .  Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA  doi:10.1073/pnas.0908446106; 2009 ). While you trill to an aria from your favourite operetta, an audience of \u201cmicrobes of potential public health concern\u201d may well have prime seats in your shower head.  Shower heads are known to harbour microorganisms, mainly because they provide a warm, moist environment prone to the formation of biofilms \u2014 aggregates of microbes that adhere to surfaces. Previous studies have sought to identify the organisms that reside in shower heads by culturing them. But as most bacteria can't easily be grown in the laboratory, shower-head biofilm assemblages have remained largely uncharacterized. In their study, Pace and colleagues use molecular techniques to analyse the microbes found in 45 shower heads obtained from nine cities in the United States. The authors sequenced bacterial genes isolated from each shower-head biofilm and identified the resident microbes by comparing their results with the genes of known bacteria. Such non-culture \u2014 or metagenomic \u2014 techniques have revolutionized our ability to characterize the microbial communities that live among us. Pace and co-workers found that the shower heads contained many types of bacteria commonly found in water and soil. The striking result, however, was the abundance of non-tuberculous mycobacteria, in particular  Mycobacterium avium  \u2014 the amounts in the biofilm were 100-fold higher than those found in the associated water supply. About 20% of shower-head swabs harboured  M. avium  DNA sequences, and this figure rose to a staggering 78% when the authors used molecular techniques that specifically detect this organism. Why are non-tuberculous mycobacteria so common in shower-head environments? These organisms are known to be chlorine-resistant, and they may actually be enriched by the treatments used to disinfect municipal water supplies. In fact, when the researchers attempted to clean one shower head harbouring a  Mycobacterium gordonae  species with bleach, they managed only to increase its relative abundance. Non-tuberculous mycobacteria are opportunistic pathogens that can cause severe disease in immunocompromised people, and they can also infect healthy people. The rates of infection with these mycobacteria are increasing in resource-rich countries. Pace and colleagues' work lends support to the possibility that our predilection to soap in the shower, rather than soak in the bath, may be a contributory factor. Reprints and Permissions"},

T. Ngo  et al .  Nature Chem. Biol.  doi:10.1038/nchembio.200; 2009 ). Their work is based on the principle that proteins can be tracked in experiments if they are engineered so that some of their constituent amino acids contain a tag, such as a radioactive label; tagged amino acids can be added to cells in culture, whereupon the cells incorporate them into newly formed proteins. The general problem with this approach is that all the cells in the culture become labelled, whereas it might be that only certain types of cell need to be tagged. Ngo and colleagues' solution to that problem involves non-naturally occurring amino acids that contain azide (N 3 ) groups in their side chains. Azides don't react with biological molecules, but under certain conditions they do react quickly with synthetic molecules that contain alkyne groups (which have carbon\u2013carbon triple bonds). Once incorporated into proteins, azide-containing amino-acid residues will thus react with alkyne-containing fluorescent dyes or affinity reagents, so tagging the proteins for imaging, detection or separation. Non-natural amino acids are already used for protein labelling, but Ngo  et al . take the idea further. They exploit an azide-containing amino acid that is incorporated into proteins only by cells that express a mutant of the methionyl-tRNA synthetase enzyme (which is involved in protein synthesis). When the authors added this amino acid to a co-culture of normal and mutant  Escherichia coli  cells, only the mutants were subsequently tagged with an alkyne-containing affinity reagent or fluorescent dye. To show that their technique could be applied to mixtures of bacterial and mammalian cells, Ngo  et al . infected mouse macrophages with  E. coli  cells that express the mutant enzyme, in the presence of the azide-containing amino acid. They then treated the macrophages with a green alkyne-containing dye, which tagged only the bacterial cells (pictured; macrophages are stained orange, and are about 15 micrometres in diameter). The authors were also able to specifically tag newly synthesized bacterial proteins with an affinity reagent, which was then used as a handle to isolate those proteins from the culture. The authors' approach allows the cellular origins of proteins in complex multicellular systems to be determined. It could therefore be handy for isolating proteins from pathogens in studies of infections, for example, or for identifying the complement of proteins of a single bacterial species living in a community of many other microbial organisms.

However, the converse is certainly not true: all glacial soils cannot be correlated with areas where the prevalence of multiple sclerosis is high.

So, too, has the myth of the Phoenix, and when Maurice Burton saw a tame rook disporting himself on a heap of burning straw it led to an association of ideas which was ultimately responsible for the production of this book ... Burton carried out experiments with his tame rooks and a pet jay to determine their reactions to certain substances and to heat ...

Burton comes to the conclusion that anting must be regarded as a posture adopted in moments of unusually intense excitement ... Ant-bathing and thermophily are also shown to be closely related to anting proper and all these are related to such habits as the self-anointing of hedgehogs, the effects of catmint and other odorants on carnivores, as well as numerous idiosyncrasies of behaviour among individual birds and mammals.

Herb York, who died on 19 May at the age of 87, was present at the creation of the US postwar defence research and development establishment and, from a very early date, was one of its scientific leaders. He also quickly recognized the limitations of technology in providing security, and became a leader in arms control and in educating younger people on the complexities of our nuclear age. York was unflappable, always accessible and always open to a good argument. His initiatives in defence, arms control and education continue to shape key institutions in the United States. During the Second World War, York worked on the Manhattan Project to develop nuclear weapons. After the atom bomb was dropped over Hiroshima on 6 August 1945, he concluded that war had finally become too terrible to fight, \u201cnot know[ing]\u201d, as he later wrote, \u201cthat the same thing had been said many times before\u201d. A sense of responsibility for the consequences of the atom bomb never left him. In 1952, he was picked by Ernest Lawrence from the obscurity of an assistant professorship in physics at the University of California (UC), Berkeley, to lead what became the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. During York's six years there (Lawrence suggested he call himself director after the first year and a half), the laboratory grew from about 100 people to 3,000, and among other tasks was entrusted with the development of the warhead for the first submarine-launched missile, Polaris. The laboratory pioneered several techniques, among them the use of the largest computers then available (which were less powerful than today's laptops) to model complex events such as nuclear explosions. As with most good labs, constant review and questioning of assumptions, goals and methods were the norm. But York added a good-humoured, positive yet realistic attitude, in which setbacks were cause for learning rather than finger-pointing criticism. In 1957, York was asked by the first presidential science adviser, James Killian, to join the President's Science Advisory Committee, which President Dwight Eisenhower had just founded in response to the Soviet launch of the Sputnik satellite. Several of the main lines of today's defence establishment were created then, particularly as regards nuclear forces and research and development. On the committee, York was a major influence in starting what is now called the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, a (comparatively) freewheeling research and development establishment within the Pentagon, which was supposed to \u2014 and to this day does \u2014 introduce new technological ideas into the system. He was promptly named as its first chief scientist and then became the first director of Defense Research and Engineering, a post from which he both supervised and moderated the burgeoning US missile forces. York was also instrumental in transferring the US Army's space facility at Huntsville, Alabama (where the German rocket expert Wernher von Braun and his colleagues had landed at the end of the Second World War), and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, to NASA. He thereby helped to place space exploration in the United States firmly in civilian hands. It was from those years that York came to have a sober view of what the military\u2013industrial\u2013congressional complex would do without (and sometimes despite) politically powerful and technically well-informed supervision. In this he was very much in tune with Eisenhower. Both were ahead of the political establishment of the time and had mixed success. After recovering from a serious heart attack in 1960, York became the founding chancellor of UC San Diego, a campus dedicated to excellence in science. He served four years in that post and remained at the university as professor of physics for the rest of his life. He served a second term as interim chancellor from 1970 to 1972. Throughout that period, York continued to work on the issues raised by the nuclear age, particularly arms control and non-proliferation. Joseph Nye, then deputy to the undersecretary of state for security assistance, science and technology, and chair of the National Security Council Group on Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons, remembers him \u201cas a mature, insightful and calming presence as an adviser as we developed [President] Carter's non- proliferation policy\u201d. Carter also appointed York as the ambassador leading the US delegation in negotiating a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty in 1979. In the early1980s, York was instrumental in getting Jerry Brown, governor of California, and UC president David Saxon to set up the Institute on Global Conflict and Cooperation (IGCC), which is dedicated to research and teaching in the area of preventing war. The institute's creation was the realization of York's goal that the Second World War, and especially Hiroshima, had inspired forty years before. It spans several UC campuses as well as the nuclear-weapons laboratories, which were then managed by the university. York served as the first director and continued to contribute to it until his death. Several of his initiatives at the IGCC continue, such as the summer nuclear-weapons policy training programmes and the Track 2 dialogues, which are informal conversations among officials from different countries on particular issues. He also made a more personal contribution: he linked today's students and young researchers to the time when nuclear weapons were first introduced, putting a human face on how the new dilemmas were resolved or not, and why policy responses took the shape that they did. York combined realistic assessments of the dangers with advocacy for steps to alleviate them, all of this serious work being enlightened by his sunny, open disposition. Herb York won most of the honours available in his various fields, including the 1994 Leo Szilard Lectureship Award and the 2000 Enrico Fermi Award and published six books about his experiences and views. He exemplified how scientists can best serve the common cause in a dangerous and controversial area, despite the many puzzles and contradictions that such service implies. He did it with a sense of balance, good humour and decency under pressure that continues to encourage the rest of us. Reprints and Permissions"},

Cooper"}], "parsed_as_year": "2006_or_before", "body": "Can microorganisms learn from history? When a sequence of environmental changes is repeated, natural selection might select for responses that enable the microbes to prepare for later challenges in the sequence. Ivan Pavlov is famous for demonstrating that dogs can learn to associate events that occur close together in time 1 . By repeatedly preceding food delivery with an unrelated stimulus (sometimes bells, sometimes electric shocks), Pavlov was able to condition dogs to link these events. After a while, the stimulus was sufficient for the dogs to anticipate food. On  page 220  of this issue, Mitchell  et al . 2  present evidence that microorganisms can benefit from conditioned responses that allow them to prepare for environmental changes. The proposal that microorganisms can associate a stimulus with an appropriate response to a future environment might seem far-fetched. After all, without cognition, microorganisms rely on simple regulatory networks to sense and respond to their environment. A canonical example of gene regulation, the response of  Escherichia coli  to the sugar lactose, illustrates why it seems surprising that such networks can be used to anticipate environmental changes. This bacterium activates genes needed for lactose use (the response) only in the presence of lactose or similar chemicals (the stimulus). The response is mediated by a specific interaction between lactose and a regulatory protein that lessens the activity of the protein, reducing its ability to repress the lactose genes. This direct link between the stimulus and the response makes sense: it reduces costly gene activation in the absence of lactose, while ensuring that activation occurs when it is useful. \n               Insight \n             If regulatory networks function to sense the current environment, how is it possible for them to induce a response that will be beneficial only in a future environment? The insight of Mitchell  et al . 2 , building on previous work 3 , was to realize that the connection between stimulus and response can be offset in time. For example, if a non-lactose sugar consistently follows the availability of lactose, selection might favour the evolution of a regulatory network that directly links the presence of lactose to the expression of the non-lactose-utilization genes. This network would serve to 'prime' cells, conferring an advantage by preparing them to use the non-lactose sugar in anticipation of its imminent availability, and thereby reducing the lag time characteristic of  de novo  activation of response genes. Mitchell  et al . call this mechanism adaptive anticipatory conditioning. But how can this idea be addressed experimentally? Mitchell  et al . examine the responses of  E. coli  and baker's yeast,  Saccharomyces cerevisiae , to sequences of environmental changes that it is reasonable to think they may have been repeatedly exposed to throughout their evolutionary histories. For  E. coli , the authors consider stimuli and appropriate responses associated with passage through the initial region of the gastrointestinal tract (an environment relatively high in lactose but low in the sugar maltose), and potentially adaptive responses in the lower part of the tract (an environment relatively low in lactose and high in maltose). For yeast, they consider the temporal sequence of stresses associated with fermentation: high temperature, increasing levels of ethanol and exposure to oxidative stress. For both  E. coli  and yeast, Mitchell  et al . find evidence that early environmental stimuli prime cells to better deal with later environments. In  E. coli , lactose (the early stimulus) caused intermediate activation of maltose genes (the late response). This priming provided a growth benefit, relative to unprimed cells, when cells were subsequently transferred to an environment containing maltose. Similarly, in yeast, early stress stimuli induced responses that conferred protection to later stresses. For example, pre-exposure to ethanol conferred a 29-fold increase in survival to subsequent exposure to an oxidative stress that simulated late-fermentation conditions. Priming alone, however, is not sufficient to infer that an anticipatory response has taken place. For example, it is possible that activation of maltose genes may provide  E. coli  with a benefit during growth in lactose. If so, benefits of priming following transfer to a subsequent environment could be a side effect of this direct advantage. To address this possibility, Mitchell  et al . took advantage of an experiment in which  E. coli  were evolved in an environment containing only lactose 4 . In this environment, the temporal link between the presence of lactose and future maltose availability is removed. Consistent with the priming response being selected to prepare cells for future availability of maltose, the presence of lactose no longer induced maltose genes in the evolved strains. Moreover, this change was associated with the loss of the lactose pre-exposure advantage before transfer to maltose. \n               Responses \n             Mitchell and colleagues' experiments 2  show that microorganisms can interpret their environment and respond in a way that provides a benefit only following a future environmental change. The ecological forces, if any, selecting for this ability are less clear. Responses that seem anticipatory in carefully defined lab environments may simply be side effects of imperfect regulation, providing no benefit in complex natural environments. Alternatively, the responses could provide a direct benefit in an unknown but important environment relevant to selection in nature. Collection of detailed fitness and ecological data will be required to address these points. What are the relative costs and benefits of being primed in natural environments? How reliably does a potential stimulus precede a particular environmental change? Depending on the answers to these questions, it may turn out that other response strategies are more successful. One message is clear. The regulatory networks that link environmental stimuli to microbial responses are complex and can evolve rapidly. The potential for microorganisms to offset responses from environments in which those responses are useful provides both a warning and an opportunity for researchers involved in testing the functional significance of links between stimuli and responses.

Photonic crystals are instrumental in achieving such a manoeuvre. Photonic crystals are artificial materials made of periodically arranged insulating structures that are specially designed to aid the trapping and confinement of light within a very small area. These crystals offer the possibility of confining light on sub-wavelength scales in air, and provide a foundation for guiding light through circuit paths in a three-dimensional (3D) optical (as opposed to electronic) microchip without energy loss caused by light scattering. The crystals also enable unprecedented strong coupling effects between light and semiconductor nanocrystals, known as quantum dots. These effects provide a route to fast information processing and computing by optical means. However, such tantalizing opportunities require that photonic crystals be accurately synthesized and that light be efficiently manipulated both inside and at the surface of the crystal without loss. In this issue ( page 367 ), Ishizaki and Noda 1  take an important step towards achieving these goals by demonstrating the control of light at the surface of a suitably constructed, gallium-arsenide-based, 3D photonic crystal. The special, regularly repeating arrangement of insulating (dielectric) structures in photonic crystals gives them a special property: light waves with frequencies that fall within a range known as the photonic band gap (PBG) are prevented from propagating because of destructive wave-interference effects. This provides a clean slate on which to write optical circuit paths. Ishizaki and Noda's woodpile-type structure consists of layers of dielectric rods stacked together (see Fig. 1a on page 367). Although it exhibits a bulk 3D PBG \u2014 that is, frequencies within the PBG are blocked from flowing inside the material in all possible directions \u2014 there are frequencies (modes) within the otherwise forbidden gap in which light can leak from the crystal interior to the exterior surface, travel freely along the surface of the crystal and eventually escape into free space. In other words, the edges of the slate are not completely clean. \n               Modification \n             To control the leakage of light into unwanted surface modes, the authors 1  reapply the PBG concept to the surface itself. They modify the surface layer of the material by constructing a two-dimensional (2D) periodic structure to create a 2D PBG for the surface modes. The spectral overlap between the bulk 3D PBG and the 2D surface PBG then provides the desired frequency window in which no electromagnetic waves can propagate, either within the woodpile architecture or along its surface. With this completely clean slate, the last remaining escape pathways for light are removed and light within the 3D microchip can be controlled at will. The experimental demonstration 1  of a simultaneous 3D PBG and 2D surface PBG has several implications. Ishizaki and Noda have used this to demonstrate a strongly localized state on the surface of their woodpile structure that persists for around 9,000 optical cycles before it releases its trapped light to free space. This light trap was engineered by introducing a defect \u2014 in the form of a local deviation from horizontal periodicity \u2014 on the surface of a thin 3D photonic crystal; that is, one with only two repeating units of vertical periodicity. If thicker 3D crystals were used, the lifetime would be expected to increase dramatically. However, this is only one small indicator of the implications of the authors' successful integration of defects of different dimensionality within 3D PBG architectures. For example, circuits for light in an optical microchip are based on one-dimensional defects known as linear waveguides 2 . In optical communications and information processing, a crucial issue is the 'insertion loss' as light enters the in-chip waveguide from an external optical fibre. The efficiency of the coupling between the chip and the fibre is limited by light scattering into unwanted surface modes. Unlike their conventional equivalents, photonic-crystal fibres 3  \u2014 those carved out of otherwise-perfect 2D PBG crystals \u2014 would enable the efficient transfer of optical information from fibre to chip, provided that unwanted surface modes on the 3D chip are eliminated 4 . Ishizaki and Noda's results provide the required clean slate. The 3D optical microchips of the future will require not only the bulk 3D PBG crystal to provide overall confinement of light within the chip, but also the integration of lower-dimensional defects and band-gap materials. This would completely control the flow of light and tailor its nonlinear interaction with the optical resonators embedded within the photonic crystal. One possible solution is to use PBG heterostructures, which involve sandwiching a layer of photonic crystal with a 2D PBG between two identical 3D PBG materials 5 . In their study 1 , Ishizaki and Noda have, in effect, synthesized the open-faced version of the sandwich, a step towards constructing and demonstrating light flow within the fully 3D circuitry of a 3D optical microchip 5 . Optical computing in a photonic microchip requires that tiny pulses of laser light pass through the waveguide circuitry and that these pulses, in turn, control and switch the flow of other optical pulse streams. In free space, these pulse streams would simply pass through each other, transferring no information from one to the other. By coupling these optical pulses to 'artificial atoms' (quantum dots) embedded near or within a photonic-crystal waveguide, it should be possible to control light with light 6 . When the quantum dots are excited or de-excited by one pulse stream, they can coherently amplify or attenuate pulses in the second stream of optical information, enabling information processing. \n               Confinement \n             In conventional materials, high-power laser beams are needed to make this nonlinear process occur. However, with less than a milliwatt of laser power flowing through a 3D PBG waveguide, it is possible to deliver electric-field amplitudes in the range of 10,000\u2013100,000 volts per centimetre as a result of the confinement of light modes on sub-wavelength scales by the 3D PBG material. This tight confinement and concentration of light prompts an otherwise unattainable response from quantum dots at modest levels of laser power. Whereas the 3D PBG is often associated with the inhibition of spontaneous emission of light from a quantum dot, suitably embedded planar and linear waveguides can be used to engineer spectral windows within the PBG in which the rate of spontaneous emission relative to that in free space is increased by several thousand. This enhancement of the coupling of light to quantum dots, or more generally of the strength of light\u2013matter interactions, will help novel quantum-electrodynamics phenomena \u2014 such as 'vacuum Rabi splitting' in single quantum dots 7  and large 'Mollow splitting' in a collection of quantum dots 6  \u2014 to emerge. The synthesis of high-quality 3D PBG materials and the control of their surface optical modes as demonstrated by Ishizaki and Noda is progress towards these and other far-reaching goals in both basic and applied science.

Charron"}], "parsed_as_year": "2006_or_before", "body": "'Father' of the human leukocyte antigen system. Jean Dausset, who died in Majorca, Spain, on 6 June 2009, aged 92, will always be remembered for the discovery of the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) tissue system, one of the most significant scientific breakthroughs of the twentieth century. The HLA system \u2014 a collection of genes that encode polymorphic molecules expressed on the surface of cells \u2014 determines the biological identity of an individual's cells and tissues. Because recognition of HLA molecules by the immune system allows it to distinguish self cells from foreign cells, this discovery laid the foundations for successful organ transplantation. Dausset not only pioneered the scientific and medical research into HLA, but also embraced and promoted the sociological and philosophical impacts of this finding. Dausset was born in Toulouse, France, into a provincial bourgeois family, and spent his youth in Biarritz before the family moved to Paris. He completed his medical education at the Faculty of Medicine at the University of Paris. During the Second World War, he joined the French army transfusion service and participated in the Tunisian and Normandy campaigns. It was in the Army Medical Corps, where he oversaw large numbers of blood transfusions, that his drive to understand the causes of frequent adverse reactions against blood cells was born. As part of the Marshall Plan, he attended Harvard University for a year, in 1948, where he worked as a clinical haematologist at the Peter Bent Brigham Hospital. On his return to Paris, he specialized in immunohaematology. In 1952, Dausset made the seminal observation that serum from patients who had received multiple blood transfusions caused marked agglutination of white blood cells (leukocytes). Dausset attributed this leukoagglutination to an antibody in the serum directed against the white blood cells. In 1958, he described the first human leukocyte antigen, which he named MAC (now known as HLA-A2), in a single-author publication. He went on to define the genetic region that encodes the complex system of cell-surface antigens, which he termed HU-1, later renamed human leukocyte antigen. In the 1960s, Dausset teamed up with the surgeon Felix Rapaport in Paris. Together they performed hundreds of skin-graft experiments on volunteers, correlating graft survival with the extent of HLA incompatibility and thereby demonstrating the role of HLAs in human transplantation. He considered these volunteers the 'real heroes' of the discovery of the HLA system and always acknowledged their contribution on receipt of honours. Today, many years after his discovery, tissue typing (determining the combination of HLAs on cells) is an essential tool for selecting donors for organ and bone-marrow transplantation. Dausset's pioneering work on the HLA system was recognized in 1980 when he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, together with Baruj Benacerraf and George Snell, for \u201ctheir discoveries concerning genetically determined structures on the cell surface that regulate immunological reactions\u201d. Although Dausset's own contributions were not in the field of immunology, he always insisted that HLAs were important in the control of immune responses as established by Hugh McDevitt, a colleague he particularly admired. They both anticipated that the HLA system contributed to susceptibility or resistance to disease, including autoimmune disease. With extraordinary prescience, Dausset extended this principle to espouse the concept of a new form of medicine that used an individual's genetic profile to predict disease \u2014 he named this 'predictive medicine' and foresaw its potential in personalized disease prevention. Dausset recognized that the HLA system was a tool that could be used to analyse the genetics and migration patterns of populations. His interest in the anthropological implications of his discovery took him on a voyage to Easter Island, where he collected blood samples from this isolated population for genetic analysis. He also realized that the HLA model could be extended to the entire human genetic system and, in 1984, together with Daniel Cohen, created the Human Polymorphism Study Centre (CEPH) \u2014 a resource that facilitates genetic studies of human populations. The genotyping of large numbers of reference families by the CEPH, and the sharing of this information with scientific peers, contributed to the determination of the first genetic linkage map of the human genome, and led the way to the discovery of genes that predispose to numerous diseases. In addition to his medical research, Dausset worked as a French government adviser from 1955 to 1958, and was instrumental in shaping French law integrating science education and medicine, leading to the creation of the CHU (University Hospitals). In 1969, he founded France Transplant, an organization that coordinated organ transplantation across France. With Jean Bernard, his colleague at the Hopital St Louis, Paris, he established the French Bone Marrow Donors Registry of unrelated donors for bone-marrow transplantation. When these organizations were taken over by national administration, he voiced concern that the humanistic nature of these endeavours would be diluted by bureaucracy. Dausset was eventually elected president of the Universal Movement for Scientific Responsibility (MURS), and actively campaigned against patenting the human genome sequence. Dausset never had a mentor. The discovery of the HLA system stemmed from his own vision and was initially driven solely by his ferocious determination. By contrast, for more than 50 years as a scientist, he embodied a spirit of international collaboration, gathering around him numerous students, colleagues and friends, whom he encouraged and supported. This extended worldwide community, which had a strong South American and Hispanic flavour, firmly established him as the 'father of HLA'. He enjoyed this parental status and designated the immunologist Rose Payne the 'mother' of HLA. A passionate collector of modern plastic arts, for a time he owned an art gallery in Saint Germain des Pr\u00e9s, Paris. He poetically summarized his philosophy of life in the title of his autobiography  Clin d'Oeil \u00e0 la Vie  ( A Wink at Life ). His wife Rosita, daughter Ir\u00e8ne and son Henri were a constant support. Dausset died peacefully in Majorca, surrounded by his family and immersed in the Hispanic culture he was so fond of. His uniqueness will endure. Reprints and Permissions"},

Snyder"}], "parsed_as_year": "2006_or_before", "body": "Nobel laureate who pioneered research into nitric oxide. In 1992,  Science  heralded nitric oxide (NO) as 'molecule of the year', less than six years after it had been identified as a physiological dilator of blood vessels, accounting for the activity of a molecule known as endothelium-derived relaxing factor (EDRF). On 19 May 2009, Robert Furchgott, whose research was most influential in leading to the discovery that NO is EDRF, died peacefully in Seattle, Washington, aged 92.  Bob, as he was known to friends (Robert to family), was born in Charleston, South Carolina, in 1916, and spent his high-school years in the small town of Orangeburg. He began college at the University of South Carolina, then transferred to the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill a year later, when his father became a North Carolina resident. Furchgott worked his way through college as a technician in a laboratory studying the physical chemistry of cellulose. His fascination with physical chemistry led to a graduate-school placement at Northwestern University Medical School in Chicago, Illinois, in a laboratory addressing the physical properties of red blood cells, the subject of his PhD thesis. In 1940, he joined Ephraim Shorr's group at Cornell University Medical School in New York City, where he spent nine years focusing on cardiovascular research. With the onset of the Second World War, the laboratory turned its attention to wartime issues, especially the physiology of irreversible haemorrhagic shock. Furchgott found evidence for a natural substance that contributes to irreversible vasodilation, and attempted to isolate it using strategies that presaged his approach to studying EDRF some 40 years later. Furchgott's first faculty position, in 1949, was in the pharmacology department at Washington University in St Louis, Missouri, where he began examining the effects of drugs on blood vessels. His first publication there, in 1953, includes a description of the effects of acetylcholine and sodium nitrite on the contraction of strips of rabbit aorta. In this work he made an observation that could have predicted the source of EDRF \u2014 acetylcholine, well known as a vasodilator in the intact organism, produced contractions only in blood vessels that he had prepared with consummate care, presumably inadvertently removing the EDRF-producing endothelial layer. In St Louis, Furchgott also discovered photorelaxation when one of his preparations, which sat beneath a sunlit window, dilated much more than preparations in a darker section of the laboratory \u2014 in retrospect, it seems likely that photorelaxation reflects the release of NO by blood vessels in response to light. After seven years in St Louis, Furchgott moved to what is now called the State University of New York (SUNY) Downstate Medical Center in Brooklyn as chair of pharmacology, where he continued his research on blood-vessel pharmacology as well as developing theories of blood-vessel-receptor activity. Experiments leading to the EDRF concept began about 22 years later, in 1978, when his technician failed to follow the standard protocol for preparing the rabbit aorta strips and, instead of contraction in response to acetylcholine, Furchgott saw relaxation. He was eager to troubleshoot this 'accident', and after several weeks realized that gentle rubbing of the endothelial layer of blood vessels transformed relaxation into contraction. One explanation was that acetylcholine acts on receptors on endothelial cells (removed by the rubbing) to trigger the release of a substance with relaxing activity \u2014 EDRF. He obtained direct evidence for this by making a 'sandwich' of a strip of aorta freed of endothelial cells to which he applied the endothelium of another aortic strip; this procedure transformed contraction into relaxation. Over the next few years, various clues emerged that ultimately led to the identification of NO as EDRF. Calcium ionophores were effective in eliciting EDRF activity, which we now know reflects the requirement of NO synthase for calcium/calmodulin. Ferid Murad had shown that NO is the active metabolite of nitroglycerine, a drug that mediates its vasorelaxant effects by stimulating guanylyl cyclase, converting GTP to cyclic GMP. EDRF was also shown to stimulate cyclic GMP formation. Haemoglobin, known to interfere with the effects of NO on cyclic GMP, inhibited EDRF. And methylene blue, which inhibits stimulation of guanylyl cyclase by nitroglycerine-like drugs, also blocked EDRF activity. Billy Martin, working in the Furchgott lab, had noted that acidification of a tissue extract enhanced its vasorelaxant activity, and acidification is known to convert nitrite to NO. At about this time, Salvador Moncada and Paul Vanhoutte reported that superoxide rapidly inactivates EDRF and that superoxide dismutase prevents this. On the basis of these clues, Furchgott carried out definitive experiments testing whether NO might be EDRF. Relaxation by both NO and EDRF was inhibited by haemoglobin, methylene blue and superoxide generators, and was potentiated by superoxide dismutase. Moreover, both NO and EDRF augmented levels of cyclic GMP. At a July 1986 symposium, Furchgott proposed that NO is EDRF. At the same meeting, Louis Ignarro presented findings using similar experimental approaches and with the same conclusion. The identification of NO as EDRF was made when Furchgott was 70 years old, a feat of late-life productivity reminiscent of Hans Kosterlitz, who published his identification of the enkephalin pentapeptides as 'the brain's own morphine' in December 1975, when he was 72. In 1996, Furchgott shared the Albert Lasker Basic Medical Research Award with Ferid Murad. In 1998, Murad, Ignarro and Furchgott shared the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine \u201cfor their discoveries concerning nitric oxide as a signalling molecule in the cardiovascular system\u201d. In contrast to many self-promoting, hyper-ambitious scientists, Furchgott was ever mild mannered, self-effacing and generous to a fault. With his first wife Lenore Mandelbaum, he had three daughters, Terry, Jane and Sue, who survive him along with four grandchildren and a great-grandchild. Lenore died in 1983, after which he married Maggie Roth, who died several years ago. In 2008 he moved to a retirement community in Seattle. His voracious curiosity never flagged. According to Sue, \u201che visited every single museum, even obscure ones at least once, many more than once\u201d. She summarized her father's principal attributes: \u201cHe was a real southern gentleman.\u201d I concur. Reprints and Permissions"},

Womersley discusses the vegetation of the island, while other contributors provide details about the mammals, birds, fishes and insects.

Since that time it has become known that about 600,000 people live in the Australian territories alone ... This issue is also of interest for its reference to the discovery of a rare animal in Australia, the potoroo ( Potorous tridactylus ). This animal, which is related to the rat-kangaroos, is now rare in New South Wales, not having been recorded in the State since 1913. It is still common in Tasmania.

Elsewhere in this issue, Dean  et al . provide further molecular insights into the workings of this pathogen (pictured, with red blood cell). They focus on the cell-differentiation events associated with its transmission between host and vector ( S.Dean  et al .  Nature   459,   213\u2013217; 2009 ). In response to the metabolites citrate or  cis -aconitate, trypanosomes differentiate from a non-dividing, stumpy form \u2014 the form thought to be taken up by the parasite's tsetse fly vector from the mammalian host's bloodstream \u2014 to a dividing form found in the fly's midgut. The parasite becomes sensitive to the metabolite signals through exposure to low temperatures, which the fly often experiences while feeding at dusk or dawn. But the surface molecules responsible for transmitting the signals to the microbe have remained elusive. Dean and colleagues find that trypanosomes sense citrate through the PAD family of cell-surface transporter proteins. Only the stumpy form seems to express these proteins, establishing it as the competent stage in the parasite's life cycle for transmission from its mammalian host to the fly. The authors also find that reducing PAD expression decreases citrate-induced trypanosome differentiation. PAD proteins could therefore potentially be used as molecular markers when screening for compounds that promote transition to the non-dividing, and so less-virulent, stumpy form.

It is the first study of its kind to be conducted among English-speaking peoples and, indeed, probably in the world ... In general, television does not cause listlessness, loss of sleep, bad dreams, lack of concentration, or eye strain. Children are not made more passive or become more aggressive, or kept away from youth clubs by television. Against this are a number of conclusions which, on balance, suggest that television, as at present administered, has more harmful than beneficial influence on children ... The main recommendation made by Dr. Himmelweit and her colleagues is that the B.B.C. and I.T.A. must collaborate much more over the balance of programmes.

The society has promoted legislation for the gratuitous distribution of quinine, has prepared quinine in its most agreeable forms, and has introduced into practice the mechanical measures based on the defence of the habitation and the individual from the bites of mosquitoes. The result is that the mortality from malaria in Italy has declined from 16,000 in 1902 to about 4000 in 1908 ... the growth of our knowledge of the causation and prevention of malaria illustrates the stages through which so many of the great discoveries in medicine have had to pass, and is a striking example of the value of experimental methods in medical research.

A good cost-cutting measure is to perform reactions on a small scale, thereby reducing the outlay on raw materials and minimizing the energy required to drive the reactions. Reporting in  Nature Chemistry , Anzenbacher and Palacios describe the ultimate in miniature reaction vessels \u2014 junctions formed when two polymer nanofibres are fused together (P. Anzenbacher Jr & M. A. Palacios  Nature Chem . doi:10.1038/nchem.125; 2009 ). The authors prepared nanofibres \u2014 each hundreds of times narrower than a human hair \u2014 from readily available polymers, and loaded them with various chemical reactants. They then laid fibres containing different reactants across each other and exposed them to either heat or solvent vapour. This caused the fibres to fuse together, forming junctions that defined discrete chemical reactors with attolitre-scale volumes (1 attolitre is 10 \u221218  litres). The junctions contained as few as 1,500 molecules of each reactant. To illustrate the principle of their ultra-small reactors, Anzenbacher and Palacios doped fibres with two non-fluorescent compounds that form a fluorescent product when they react. When the two types of fibres were overlapped to form a random mat and then heated, fluorescence at the fused junctions clearly indicated the formation of the reaction product (pictured). The authors showed that several types of reactions can be performed in their attoreactors, including those in which one of the reactants is polymeric (although reactions with two polymeric reactants are expected to be problematic, because polymers can't easily diffuse through the nanofibre matrix). Furthermore, the products can be analysed directly within the junctions using fluorescence measurements or mass spectrometry. Several applications for these attoreactors suggest themselves. For example, libraries of nanofibres could be prepared in which each nanofibre is loaded with a different compound from the same chemical class. Selected libraries could then be reacted with each other, as in combinatorial chemistry, to prepare many different products quickly and easily. If the products could be screened directly for biological activity, this would be useful for the high-throughput preparation and testing of compounds in drug-discovery programmes.

This treatment would sterilize any insects, or nematodes present in the soil, and would probably destroy a high percentage of the bacteria and fungi. From  Nature  28 March 1959. \n               100 Years ago \n             Much interest has been aroused in Sussex by the discovery of the greater part of a skeleton of a mammoth ( Elephas primigenius ) on the shore of Selsey Bill. The remains were found below high-water mark in the estuarine or fresh-water deposit of black clay, which underlies the raised beach and coombe rock on that part of the Sussex coast. The thick mass of shingle, which usually covers this deposit, was temporarily removed during the recent stormy weather, and the teeth and broken bones were found projecting from the clay. Probably the whole skeleton was originally present, but when found the bones were already much eroded, and they were scattered over an area about 30 feet square. Both upper and lower molar teeth were recovered, and their condition shows that the animal was immature and of small size. Fragmentary remains, both of the mammoth and of  Elephas antiquus , have been found at various times in the same deposit in Bracklesham Bay, some of these specimens being now in the British Museum. Indications of complete skeletons are rare. They seem to have been recorded only twice in England, the first in the brick-earth of Ilford, Essex, the second in a corresponding deposit at Ealing, Middlesex. From  Nature  25 March 1909.

Changes in smoking habits are far more frequent than is generally thought to be the case, and so any information about them which refers to the past, based, as it must be, upon a general and personal assessment of current practices, is very likely to be in error ... recall is frequently mistaken both as regards the amount and the kind of smoking carried on.

Darnell Jr"}], "parsed_as_year": "2006_or_before", "body": "Inspiration and innovation in molecular cancer research.  Much of the molecular basis of cancer was revealed by research done during the last 40 years of the twentieth century, radically changing both diagnosis and treatment. One of the most influential and prolific contributors to this era was Hidesaburo Hanafusa, who died on 15 March at the age of 79. In the 1960s and early 1970s, Hanafusa's investigations of RNA 'tumour viruses' established that the cancer-causing genes of these retroviruses, now called oncogenes, have counterparts in normal animal and human cells. Then, during the 1980s and 1990s, work from his group on retroviral oncogenes provided insights into how cellular genes that normally regulate intracellular signalling go awry in cancer cells. Born and educated in Japan, Hanafusa came to the United States in 1961 to work in Harry Rubin's laboratory at the University of California, Berkeley. The ability to quantitatively study the viral transformation of normal cells into cancer cells using the 'focus assay' had just been developed there by Howard Temin. While in Rubin's lab, Hanafusa published papers that laid the foundation for the 'oncogene hypothesis' of cancer. Rubin and another postdoctoral fellow in the lab, Peter Vogt, had discovered that preparations of Rous sarcoma virus \u2014 RSV, first discovered in a chicken sarcoma by Peyton Rous in 1911 \u2014 contained another virus, which they called Rous-associated virus (RAV). Rubin suggested that Hanafusa try to isolate pure RSV and, in doing so, Hanafusa discovered that RSV was 'defective' \u2014 meaning that it lacked the genetic components necessary to replicate itself, but was able to transform normal cells into cancer cells. Hanafusa and Rubin isolated transformed cells infected with RSV that did not produce infectious virus. RAV was a 'helper' virus that provided the viral genes needed for replication. In return, the cancer-causing RSV promoted host-cell proliferation, aiding RAV in the production of the components needed for virus replication. This explained why the two viruses propagated together. That the non-transforming RAV could replicate without RSV, and that RSV could transform cells without RAV, implied that RSV carried a gene (or genes) that was not required for viral replication but was responsible for cell transformation and tumour growth. This was the earliest clear indication of the existence of a transforming oncogene. Hanafusa established his own lab with his wife Teruko \u2014 herself a noted virologist \u2014 at the Public Health Research Institute of the City of New York in 1966, and in 1973 moved uptown to The Rockefeller University. By this time, the region in RSV responsible for transformation had been mapped, and the gene located in this region had come to be known as  src  \u2014 for sarcoma. Hanafusa's and also Vogt's continuing research provided a foundation for the well-known 1977 report from the Hanafusa lab demonstrating that a transformation-defective RSV mutant was able to recover the ability to transform from a host cell. The reconstituted virus had regained the  src  gene. This work closely followed the classic 1976 report from the laboratories of Michael Bishop and Harold Varmus demonstrating that viral  src  sequences are similar to sequences in uninfected cells. The recovery of an active transforming  src  (later shown to be mutated) from a host cell by a transformation-defective virus confirmed that the sequences responsible for viral oncogenesis are captured and mutated cellular genes. Hanafusa shared the 1982 Lasker award with Bishop and Varmus for this work. Subsequent research in many other laboratories identified other mutated cellular genes that had been captured by transforming retroviruses, including the well-known  ras  oncogene. All of these studies substantiated the hypothesis that cancer-causing genes carried by transforming retroviruses are mutated, usually overactive, versions of normal cellular genes. In 1982, it was discovered that DNA isolated from human cancer cells could by itself induce transformation in mouse fibroblast cells in culture. The gene in this human DNA was a mutant form of a gene originally characterized as a retroviral oncogene \u2014 namely,  ras . In the 1980s, Hanafusa's research shifted to the structure and function of proteins encoded by viral oncogenes. By this time it had been discovered that the  src  gene product was a protein kinase an enzyme that phosphorylates and so regulates other proteins \u2014 and that it was specific for the tyrosine amino acid. In 1982, Hanafusa's group published the sequence of the Fujinami sarcoma virus and its oncogene  fps , which, like  src , also encodes a tyrosine kinase. Sequencing of  fps  revealed similarities between  fps  and  src . This point did not escape the notice of Tony Pawson, who identified regions in  fps  that were homologous to regions in  src  \u2014 most significantly, the now-famous  src -homology domain SH2. The significance of this discovery became evident when Hanafusa's group revealed that the  crk  oncogene, carried by the CT10 transforming retrovirus, encoded a small protein that consisted only of SH2 and another domain with homology to  src  \u2014 the SH3 domain. In the early 1990s, Hanafusa's group, along with Pawson and Bruce Mayer, a Hanafusa lab graduate working in David Baltimore's lab, went on to demonstrate that SH2 domains bind proteins in a manner that depends on tyrosine phosphorylation. This observation provided a molecular explanation for the protein\u2013protein interactions induced in response to the phosphorylation of proteins on tyrosine. For this and all his previous work, Hanafusa received the 1993 General Motors Sloan award. With the untimely death of Teruko, his life-long collaborator, in 1996, Hanafusa left Rockefeller in 1998 to become the director of the Osaka Bioscience Institute in Japan, where he continued to contribute to our understanding of oncogenesis while inspiring a new group of Japanese scientists. He retired from the institute in 2008. Apart from his enduring contributions to an unprecedented era of cancer research, Hanafusa trained a host of graduate students and postdoctoral fellows, many of whom have had notable scientific careers of their own. Hidesaburo Hanafusa had much to be proud of during his long scientific career. But perhaps his most enduring legacy will be his inspiration and nurturing of a generation of scientists who revered him for his sagacity, and for his warmth and quiet support.

McSween"}], "parsed_as_year": "2006_or_before", "body": "The geochemistry of the Martian surface has largely been determined by the eruption of magmas to form basaltic rocks. A new line of argument has chlorine as an influential agent in that process. The volatile constituents of magmas exercise a wholly disproportionate influence on magma behaviour. Although they are present in only tiny quantities, these elements and compounds with low boiling points profoundly affect thermodynamic properties and crystallization patterns, and the characteristics of magmatic flow and eruption. When we speak of magmatic volatiles, we normally mean water and carbon dioxide. But other volatile species might well be important, especially on planets other than Earth. Hence the interest in a proposal, reported in  Chemical Geology  by Filiberto and Treiman 1 , that chlorine is one such player. Mars is thought to be richer in volatile elements than Earth 2 , and has been seen as a good place for further study. The Mars Exploration Rover Spirit has encountered and analysed numerous basaltic rocks during its five-year trek across the Gusev crater. These rocks are produced by volcanic activity, and the abundant vesicles found in some of them ( Fig. 1 ) testify to the presence of significant quantities of volatiles. But until now, water has been assumed to be the main volatile agent, as for instance was the case in the hydrous crystallization experiments performed on a sample of Gusev basalt 3 . Filiberto and Treiman 1 , however, propose that chlorine may have a central role in the generation and evolution of Martian basalts. They have carried out experiments demonstrating that the effects of chlorine on basalt phase equilibria are similar to those of water. The addition of chlorine shifts the liquidus \u2014 the stage at which crystals begin to form \u2014 to lower temperatures and enlarges the stability field of pigeonite, a form of pyroxene that is a common constituent of basalts. This is notable because the pressure under which the two minerals olivine and pigeonite first appear together is assumed to correspond to the depth at which magma is generated, and that depth is significantly shifted towards the surface if chlorine is the volatile species. No chlorine-containing minerals have been identified in rocks of the Gusev crater, but that is no surprise because Spirit does not have instruments to do this. Conversely, although high levels of chlorine have been measured chemically by one of Spirit's spectrometers, there is the possibility that those measurements are a reflection of the ubiquitous presence of Martian dust, which contains halides including chlorine. The broader picture must take account of the fact that much of what we infer about magmatic volatiles on Mars derives from studies of certain Martian meteorites rather than rocks still on Mars. These meteorites \u2014 basaltic achondrites, which show the distinctive features of processing by volcanic activity \u2014 are remarkably anhydrous, leading some geochemists to speculate that the mantle sources for these magmas must also have been dry. That view has been challenged 4  by the need for dissolved water to explain the calcium abundances and soluble-light-element zoning patterns in pyroxene crystals of some Martian basaltic meteorites. In this model, the magmas lost all their water as they were ejected from Mars, aided by the planet's low gravity. The water contents of Martian meteorites, however, remain a contentious subject. The most persuasive argument for a role for chlorine is based on the absence of water in nominally hydrous daughter minerals (apatite and amphibole, both of which contain chlorine) in melt inclusions trapped in some Martian meteorites 5 . Filiberto and Treiman's thought-provoking paper 1  will serve a good purpose in prompting renewed debate about volatiles in Martian magmas. But to my mind it is doubtful that magma-borne chlorine would dominate on Mars. The channels and valley networks on Mars were surely eroded by water, and magmas must have delivered that water to the surface. Volcanic rocks in the Gusev crater are estimated to be billions of years old, comparable in age to some of the channels. The existence of hydrogen, which was mapped at high latitudes by Mars Odyssey's Gamma Ray Spectrometer 6 , and which presumably is in the form of subsurface water ice, also points to the outgassing of water from magmas on a global scale. Finally, however, there is a possible terrestrial connection to Filiberto and Treiman's line of investigation. They point out that lavas in certain tectonic environments on Earth can have a chlorine content of up to 0.7% by weight, and they propose that its effect in terrestrial magmas might be similar to that suggested for Mars. Experimental evidence 7 , 8  supports the idea that water is required to produce two different magmas characteristic of two different tectonic circumstances: so-called andesitic magmas in plate subduction zones, and alkaline magmas in intraplate settings. Filiberto and Treiman speculate that partial melting and fractional crystallization in chlorine-rich terrestrial systems might mimic the effect of water, an idea that merits further testing.

Jerry Yang, who died on 5 February in Boston, Massachusetts, made exceptional contributions to research on animal biotechnology and cloning, and was a prominent figure in the scientific dialogue between the United States and China. He was only 49 when he died, finally succumbing to cancer of the salivary gland. Losing battles, however, was not Yang's way of life. He was born in 1959, in China, and barely survived the famine of 1959\u201360. His parents were poor pig farmers in the tiny village of Dongcun, about 500 kilometres south of Beijing, but in the late 1970s the award of a place at Beijing Agricultural College set Yang on the road to a wider world. A scholarship to Cornell University in New York followed, where he took a master's degree and completed his PhD in reproductive physiology. Success in his subsequent research at Cornell led to his being hired by the University of Connecticut in 1996, where he held various positions, including director of the Center for Regenerative Biology. It was no mean achievement to have risen from such humble beginnings to conquer the Chinese education system, and then to have won major grants and promotions in the demanding US tertiary research system. In another respect, Yang was fortunate in having a well-prepared mind at a momentous juncture in the history of research on animal embryology. The birth of the cloned sheep Dolly was announced in 1997, and had an influence far beyond the scientific community concerned. Her birth was achieved through the procedure of somatic-cell nuclear transfer (SCNT), in which the nucleus \u2014 and so the genetic complement \u2014 of a mammary-gland cell from a mature ewe was transferred into an unfertilized sheep oocyte or egg cell, which was then allowed to develop before being implanted in a recipient ewe and coming to term. Cloning from an adult cell rarely works; it requires hundreds of nuclear transfers to produce a viable animal. Nor is it successful in humans. But it promised to revolutionize animal breeding, through the cloning of prize livestock. And it had the potential to create a new branch of regenerative medicine, one using the patient's own immune-compatible cells that could be reprogrammed by cloning to produce pluripotent stem cells for the repair of damaged and diseased tissues. Yang was in the thick of the ensuing period of intensive research. In papers that appeared between 2000 and 2006, his work confirmed that \u2014 in cattle, rabbits, pigs, mice and the swamp buffalo \u2014 fully differentiated adult somatic cells can be reprogrammed into developmentally normal embryonic cells capable of forming fully viable offspring. Moreover, he showed that first- and second-generation clones have normal fertility, which was particularly informative for sustained breeding of genetically valuable cloned bulls. Also in early work, Yang settled the debate on telomere shortening \u2014 the serial reduction in length of the ends of chromosomes as cells divide \u2014 which had been proposed as a limiting factor in the viability of cloned animals. Telomere length was unaffected by nuclear-transfer procedures, and no shortening was found in offspring cloned from even aged adults. Yang's work on cattle and many other species catapulted the United States into the forefront of animal cloning, with many biotechnology companies examining the commercial opportunities for investment in animal breeding, and for protein production in transgenic and cloned animals. In his basic research, Yang explored the cell biology of nuclear reprogramming. Notably \u2014 and contrary to expectations at the time \u2014 in 2006 he controversially reported that cloning efficiency increased with increasing differentiation within the hierarchy of progenitor cells in the haematopoetic (blood-cell) system; put technically, terminally differentiated post-mitotic granulocytes yielded cloned pups with greater efficiency than did the earlier adult stem-cell or progenitor types. Furthermore, he used molecular microarray analyses to demonstrate that adult stem cells could be reprogrammed by SCNT to acquire an embryonic-like profile of expressed genes, and he showed that the gene profile was closer to that observed in embryos fertilized  in vivo  than to that in embryos fertilized  in vitro.  But the SCNT embryos had markedly reduced developmental capacity. The apparent disconnect between embryonic gene expression and embryo viability was a particular preoccupation towards the end of his life. In 2006, Yang's life's work, and indeed a whole field of research, was put in jeopardy by the exposure of fraud by the South Korean cloning team led by Woo Suk Hwang. Hwang falsely claimed to have achieved the highly efficient production of numerous human SCNT embryonic stem-cell lines. Yang was a strong advocate for human SCNT, given its promise in 'therapeutic cloning' by providing immune-compatible tissues for cell replacement, and he was deeply concerned that this episode would seriously damage the field of regenerative medicine. In high-profile articles, he argued the case both for continued research in cloning by SCNT and for increased vigilance of scientific fraud. International collaboration was the other main strand of Yang's professional life, and he was a prominent proponent of global partnerships in science and medicine. He achieved the feat of being respected in both the academic and political sectors in China, and was a persuasive advocate for US\u2013China cooperation. He pursued his goals with typical tenacity, an example being his advocacy for an Asian\u2013Pacific network of stem-cell scientists. His case was simple: Asia is a region where political and religious ideologies are not antagonistic towards human stem-cell science. He proposed the creation of a network of regenerative-medicine institutes in China, with an international oversight committee to guarantee transparency, trust and compliance with established ethical standards, and he worked hard to establish funding and to create a suitable organization for this network. He hoped this model would be a beacon to guide the formation of other international scientific networks. Jerry Yang had a passion and determination that marks the very best in the traditions we admire and respect.

But especially dramatic examples of these phenomena have emerged from the deep sea. One corner of the world of ichthyology has just become a little tidier. Writing in  Biology Letters , Johnson  et al . 1  report their investigations of representatives of three families of marine fish \u2014 which, they find, are in fact the larvae, males and females of a single family. The previous tripartite designation was understandable, however. Johnson and colleagues reveal that the larvae undergo extraordinary metamorphoses, through post-larval and juvenile stages, before becoming transformed into male and female adults that are themselves wondrously different in appearance and anatomy. The fish concerned are the tapetails, bignose fishes and whalefishes, which respectively are currently assigned to the families Mirapinnidae, Megalomycteridae and Cetomimidae. Johnson  et al . have explored the possibility that the mirapinnids and megalomycterids are in fact pre-juvenile and adult male cetomimids, respectively. Their investigations involved study of fresh megalomycterids netted at depth in the Gulf of Mexico, as well as of museum holotypes of various forms, and molecular analyses of mitochondrial DNA (a holotype, or type specimen, is the original specimen from which the description of a new taxonomic group is made). It turns out that the only known and holotype specimen of the deep-sea megalomycterid  Megalomycter teevani  is actually a 'transforming mirapinnid' \u2014 that is, a larva caught in the act of metamorphosis into the next stage. Its gonads are histologically male. Similarly, the holotype of the deep-sea mirapinnid  Parataeniophorus gulosus  is an early transforming male specimen, which would also have metamorphosed into a megalomycterid. It therefore seems that the previously 'missing' larvae of megalomycterids are mirapinnids. Could it be that the larvae of cetomimids are also mirapinnids? It seems that the answer is yes. A whalefish,  Cetostoma regani , caught in the deep southeastern Atlantic, is shown to be a late transforming female morphologically linked with larvae/post-larvae of the mirapinnid  P. gulosus  and males of the megalomycterid  Cetomimoides parri . This implies that  P. gulosus  (larvae) , C. regani  (adult females) and  C. parri  (adult males) actually belong to a single taxon, thereby uniting the cetomimids with the two other families. Johnson  et al . conclude, then, that tapetails, bignoses and whalefishes are in fact larvae, males and females of members of the family Cetomimidae. This conclusion is consistent with the authors' evolutionary analysis of mitochondrial-genome sequence data. A task now \u2014 and no easy one \u2014 will be to find, identify and match up the larvae and adult males with the 20 described species of whalefish. Right now, there do not seem to be enough tapetails (mirapinnids) and bignoses (megalomycterids) to go round. The extraordinary morphological transformations involved give rise to extreme sexual dimorphism in the adults. The differences in morphology and habit between larvae, males and females are associated with different feeding mechanisms \u2014 or lack of them. Larvae have small, upturned mouths and feed on copepods in the food-rich, sunlit surface waters. Johnson  et al . 1  suggest that the long streamers arising from their caudal fin ( Fig. 1a ) may be involved in feeding or avoiding predators. Males ( Fig. 1b ) live down in the nutrient-poor bathypelagic zone (depths of 1,000\u20134,000 metres) and lose the ability to feed: their upper jaws become immobilized, and their stomach and oesophagus disappear. Instead, a ball of copepods in the gut of a transforming male is converted into a massive liver, which then sustains the male through adulthood. Females also live at depth. But they develop specialized gill arches, large horizontal jaws and huge gapes ( Fig. 1c ). These adaptations allow mature females to capture larger prey and to attain larger body sizes. Extreme sexual dimorphism is, for example, also found in certain deep-sea anglerfishes. The females look as 'normal' as anglerfishes are capable of looking, and do the angling with a lure attached to their head. But the tiny, atrophied males lack a digestive system and live parasitically on the female, with which they fuse 2 ; they are nonetheless male enough to provide sperm for reproduction. An example of dimorphism from the invertebrates is that of 'zombie worms' of the polychaete genus  Osedax 3 . Females feed on the bones of whale carcasses that have fallen to the sea floor. But the males \u2014 little more than sacks of sperm \u2014 live inside the females, and barely develop beyond the larval stage. As Johnson  et al . 1  point out, remarkable transformations occur in other deep-sea inhabitants, such as telescopefishes of the family Giganturidae. But a claim they make may well be justified \u2014 that the combination of radical larval metamorphosis with extreme adult sexual dimorphism in the now unified Cetomimidae is unparalleled within the vertebrates.

Fox"}], "parsed_as_year": "2006_or_before", "body": "Pioneer in studies of protein structure and function.  Frederic M. Richards, a leading light in the development of structural biology, died on 11 January at the age of 83. Richards was a seminal figure in protein science, having had a key role in shaping our fundamental understanding of protein structure and function. His contributions ranged from the early use and development of protein crystallography, to computational analysis of protein geometry, and to the development of chemical probes for the analysis of membrane proteins. Remarkably, throughout his career many of his most influential contributions stemmed from work carried out with his own hands. Richards came from old New England stock. His undergraduate education at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology was interrupted by service in the army during the Second World War, and was followed by a PhD degree at Harvard Medical School. His first and perhaps most striking contribution began in 1955, during his time as a postdoctoral fellow with Kaj Linderstr\u00f8m-Lang at the Carlsberg Laboratory in Copenhagen, and continued after he joined Yale University \u2014 where he would remain throughout his scientific career. Pancreatic ribonuclease A, an enzyme that degrades RNA, was a favoured protein for study in the 1950s. Richards discovered that it could be cut into a short 'S peptide' and a larger 'S protein', which together were termed ribonuclease S and maintained enzyme activity. When these components were separated, each lost all enzymatic activity. But, surprisingly, they could be mixed together to reconstitute the active enzyme, demonstrating that a protein's chemical sequence contains the information needed to attain its active conformation. This work foreshadowed the more extensive refolding studies of ribonuclease A carried out by Nobel laureate Christian Anfinsen. Richards used chemical modification of S peptide to examine the contributions of the amino-acid sequence to the thermodynamic stability of the ribonuclease S complex \u2014 all long before the advent of peptide synthesis and site-directed mutagenesis made these types of study widely fashionable. Together with Harold W. Wyckoff and others, Richards solved the X-ray crystal structure of ribonuclease S and examined the structure with a bound nucleoside monophosphate \u2014 this was the second enzyme structure to be solved, and the first protein structure solved in the United States. The relevance of a protein's crystal structure to its conformation in solution was a serious concern in the early days of protein crystallography. Richards's group established that the ribonuclease S protein was enzymatically active within the crystal, largely putting this issue to rest. The complex conformations seen in the earliest protein crystal structures were a surprise. Early on, before such crystals were obtained, proteins were believed to be colloidal in nature, and after protein crystals were identified they were expected to display highly symmetrical structures akin to fibrous proteins. Richards developed computational tools to investigate the packing within proteins, leading to the discovery that a protein's core is as well packed as organic molecules in molecular crystals such as table sugar. Richards developed the calculation of the solvent-accessible surface area in proteins and used it to characterize their folding, assembly and function. Numerous investigators have adopted these tools for an ever-expanding variety of applications. While on sabbatical at the University of Oxford, UK, in 1968, Richards designed and built what became known as the Richards Optical Comparator (or the Richards box), better known in Oxford as Fred's Folly, or simply the Folly, in part because of its architectural similarity to a gazebo. The device contained a half-silvered mirror that allowed the image of a wire model of a protein to be seen floating in the electron-density contour maps determined by X-ray crystallography and drawn on a set of stacked plastic sheets. The Folly permitted the wire model to be manually fitted to the electron density and was quickly adopted by protein crystallographers around the world; it was supplanted only by the advent of molecular-graphics software. My abiding memory of Fred Richards is the grin on his face when I showed him the alamethicin crystals I had grown for my PhD thesis, and his look of pride on seeing the version of the Richards box that I had built to fit the alamethicin model. The Richards laboratory was a marvellous place for students, postdoctoral fellows and visiting faculty \u2014 usually limited to half a dozen, highly independent members pursuing widely disparate projects attacking some fundamental aspect of protein science. Despite the many demands on his time, his office door was always open for energetic and educational scientific discussions. Richards's enthusiasm for protein science was legendary \u2014 as were his passions for sailing and ice hockey. Yale's Department of Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry was formed by a merger of existing departments. As founding chair, Richards proved to have a deft touch on this difficult exercise, and showed great insight in hiring an outstanding cadre of junior faculty. The department was remarkable in the breadth of training it required of its graduate students, from molecular biology to molecular biophysics \u2014 all long before protein expression allowed both groups to work in the same area. Richards also played a significant part in many science-policy issues, including his support for the Protein Data Bank (PDB), which was established in 1971 as a site for the voluntary deposition of macromolecular structures and experimental data. Richards led an early steering committee for the PDB and in the mid-1980s was head of an ad hoc committee that successfully encouraged journal editors to require structures reported in their pages to be deposited in the PDB. Richards's committee also succeeded in convincing the US National Institutes of Health to require the deposition of protein coordinates for continued funding. These policy shifts were not without controversy at the time, but their success ultimately facilitated the research of innumerable protein scientists. The timing was crucial, because it put the requirement for deposition in place just before the explosion in the number of structure determinations. Further insight into Fred Richards's many contributions, and the joy he had making them, can be found in his own words in 'Whatever happened to the fun? An autobiographical investigation', published by the  Annual Review of Biophysics and Biomolecular Structure  in 1997. Reprints and Permissions"},

Milonni"}], "parsed_as_year": "2006_or_before", "body": "The Lamb shift, a minute change in certain energy levels of quantum systems that was first measured in atomic hydrogen some 60 years ago, has now been observed in a solid-state superconducting system. The emission and absorption of light by atoms can be significantly affected by their environment. For many years, physicists have studied how atoms behave in cavities that confine light and restrict the frequencies with which the atoms interact. Cavity quantum electrodynamics (cavity QED) experiments, which examine how light and matter interact in a cavity, can be designed such that an atom is well described as a two-state system (or 'qubit') interacting with a single light frequency in a nearly lossless cavity. It has been observed, for instance, that the frequency of the light emitted (or absorbed) in an atomic transition can be altered by a cavity. More recently, similar effects have been observed in circuit QED, in which pieces of solid-state superconducting systems acting as qubits are embedded in on-chip circuits that are, in effect, one-dimensional cavities 1 , 2 . Writing in  Science , Fragner  et al . 3  now report experiments in which one of the most studied effects of QED in atomic physics \u2014 the Lamb shift \u2014 has been measured in circuit QED ( Fig. 1 ). The Lamb shift in atomic hydrogen was famously measured some 60 years ago 4 . Experiments showed that, in a vacuum, one of the atom's energy levels is shifted very slightly from the value predicted when the effect on the electron of the electromagnetic vacuum is ignored. The corresponding shift in the frequency of the transition of the electron to the ground state, relative to the unshifted frequency ( \u03bd ), is only about 4\u00d710 \u22127 . This shift can be attributed largely to the interaction of the hydrogen atom with a continuum of electromagnetic frequencies, all in the vacuum state. Quantum fluctuations of this vacuum field, associated with the emission and absorption of 'virtual' photons, cause the electron to undergo fluctuations that change its energy level from that predicted when it is assumed to interact only with the nucleus. But cavity QED has allowed for conceptually simpler experiments in which atoms interact with only one electromagnetic-field frequency. If this frequency is exactly tuned to the atomic resonance, a quantum of energy can flow back and forth between an atom and the electromagnetic field at a rate known as the Rabi frequency ( \u03a9 ). By introducing a 'detuning' ( \u0394 ) between the atomic-transition frequency and the field frequency, one can change the nature of the atom\u2013field interaction. When the ratio  \u0394 / \u03a9  is large, the observable effect of the field on the atom is to shift the atomic-transition frequency rather than to cause energy to oscillate to and fro between the atom and the field. The shift is proportional to ( q  + 1/2)/ \u0394 , where  q  is the number of photons in the cavity. The Lamb shift occurs when the cavity is devoid of photons ( q  = 0), and is thus associated with quantum fluctuations of the vacuum state of the field. This Lamb shift for a two-state atom was first measured in a cavity QED experiment 5 ; Lamb shifts amounting to about 10 \u22128   \u03bd  were measured for the smallest detunings. In circuit QED, a qubit is a superconducting two-state system based on the Josephson junction \u2014 two superconductors separated by a thin insulator across which electron pairs can tunnel. In the very simplest approximation, two parallel junctions can form a qubit with a transition frequency controllable by a magnetic field. The cavity resonator in circuit QED is effectively a one-dimensional waveguide formed by a superconducting structure patterned on a silicon chip. An electromagnetic field in such a resonator induces transitions in a qubit inside it if its frequency is close to the qubit transition frequency. Then the system can be described in much the same way as a qubit interacting with a single field frequency in cavity QED. In their experiments, Fragner and colleagues 3  measured  \u03bd  and the qubit\u2013field coupling constant, which describes the strength of the interaction and thus determines the Lamb shift. They then determined the Lamb shift from the difference between  \u03bd  and the measured, shifted qubit transition frequency. The detuning was varied by changing the magnetic flux through the qubit circuit. For the largest detunings, the authors obtained an excellent fit of the measured Lamb shifts to the simplified theoretical predictions based on the two-state model of the parallel Josephson junctions; a more accurate theory that accounts for deviations of the Josephson pair from a two-state system gave an excellent fit for all detunings. A notable difference between these Lamb shifts and those in cavity QED is their magnitude \u2014 approximately 0.014  \u03bd  at the smallest detunings. These relatively large shifts reflect a strong qubit\u2013field interaction resulting from the large electric dipole moment characterizing the qubit as well as the large vacuum-field strengths possible in the micrometre-scale resonators used in circuit QED. The strong coupling (large Rabi frequency) inferred from the Lamb-shift experiments directly illustrates one reason for the growing interest in circuit QED in connection with quantum computing 6 , 7 , 8 , which requires that information between a photon and a qubit be exchanged rapidly compared with the rates at which any other effects, such as the escape of the photon from the resonator, cause information about the qubit state to be lost.

But so far, researchers have mainly studied systems of one or two components, whereas nature can mix many more \u2014 as is the case, for example, with the assembly of ribosomes, the protein-synthesizing organelles in cells. On  page 999  of this issue, Erb  et al . show that man-made multi-component systems can assemble under the action of a magnetic field (R. M. Erb  et al .  Nature   457 , 999\u20131002; 2009). Self-assembly processes are usually driven by intermolecular forces, including hydrophobicity and the formation of hydrogen bonds, as opposed to the more-stable covalent forces. But external effects such as electrical and magnetic forces can also lend a hand. The components of such a system can range from metallic nanoparticles to biopolymers and macroscopic objects. The system studied by Erb and colleagues is a ferrofluid \u2014 a mixture of water and magnetic nanoparticles \u2014 to which larger, micrometre-sized colloidal particles of different kinds are added. When the fluid is subjected to a magnetic field, the particles can align their magnetic dipoles either with or opposite to the field depending on their magnetic properties with respect to the ferrofluid. When further magnetic nanoparticles are added, what might previously have behaved as a paramagnetic colloidal particle (one that aligns with the field) can become a diamagnetic one (aligning opposite to the field), and vice versa. Such changes cause the particles to assemble into diverse structures. The type of structure that forms depends on the size and magnetic properties of the components. Thus, the geometries of the assemblies can feature clusters of smaller particles at the poles of a larger central particle or at its equator (pictured), or even more complex, flower-shaped arrangements. Erb  et al . show that these structures have a remarkably uniform shape, and that they do not aggregate among themselves because their large, central paramagnetic particles repel each other. And they can be made to persist even after the field has been turned off. To do this, their components are made to stick to each other by attaching two kinds of molecule to them that act like Velcro once they are in close proximity. Thus, when the magnetic field is turned off and the structures are dried, they don't fall apart and can be studied individually. In the future, the use of a larger number of smaller and differently shaped components may help our understanding of complex assemblies to blossom, together with our ability to make them. A possible outcome could be the development of materials with tailored optical properties that would be useful for making biosensors. Reprints and Permissions"},

The answers to these questions can be used to follow the course of chemical reactions on solid supports, and are obtained simply by using two magnets, a salt solution and a ruler. A generation of children is familiar with the concept of levitation from the adventures of Harry Potter, and could be forgiven for thinking it unremarkable. Scientists will know of real-world examples \u2014 reports of levitating water-droplets 1 , cells 2  and even frogs 3  \u2014 but most of them probably think of it as nothing more than a curiosity. It's unlikely that anyone imagined that levitation could be used as a routine analytical tool. But in the  Journal of the American Chemical Society , Mirica  et al . 4  show that magnetic levitation is a simple, viable way to follow the course of chemical reactions that occur on solid, diamagnetic supports, such as those routinely used by chemists to prepare peptides, nucleic acids and other organic molecules. (Diamagnetic materials are those that create a weak magnetic field in opposition to an external magnetic field.) The authors use their levitation procedure to analyse beads made from insoluble polymers known as Merrifield resins \u2014 named after their inventor Robert Merrifield, who won a Nobel prize in 1984 for his discovery 5 . These polymers were originally used as ion-exchange resins 6  (which trap ions in analytical and purification procedures), but they were widely adopted by synthetic chemists as solid supports for reactions after Merrifield described their use for making peptides. Beads of Merrifield resins quickly became standard tools for preparing biologically important molecules; indeed, they enabled the biotechnology revolution. Nowadays, they are used in all manner of organic syntheses, not only as supports for reactions (for example, in combinatorial chemistry), but also as supports for reagents and catalysts 7  (because such resin-bound compounds are easily removed by filtration from reaction mixtures in solution, greatly simplifying purification procedures). Although polymer-supported reactions have been widely used for almost 50 years, the procedures available to monitor them are surprisingly limited 8 . Gel-phase nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy is the most useful technique, but this requires sophisticated instruments and is not always practical as a real-time assay. Colorimetric assays \u2014 which, as the name suggests, qualitatively monitor the amount of colour formed in a test reaction \u2014 can sometimes provide a rapid, qualitative assessment of the extent of a resin-bound reaction. But up to now, no analytical procedure could provide an almost instantaneous, qualitative and general assay of the progress of solid-supported reactions. Mirica and colleagues' technique 4  promises to change that. The authors' method requires only a test tube, a pair of commercially available magnets and an inexpensive solution of gadolinium chloride (GdCl 3 ) in water ( Fig. 1 ). When polymeric beads are suspended in the solution in a vertical magnetic field, the height at which they float depends on the balance between the gravitational and magnetic forces acting on them. This in turn depends on the density of the polymer, which changes when reactions occur on the beads. Mirica  et al . thus monitored changes in the 'floating height' of beads to follow the progress of chemical reactions on the beads. The authors' method for tracking the course of solid-supported reactions is considerably simpler than previously available methods, which require more-complex instruments and are more limited in scope. Furthermore, the levitation analysis is sensitive enough to detect even slight changes in density between beads. Mirica  et al . thus showed that their method could be used not only to determine when a reaction is complete, but also to follow reaction kinetics. Differences in floating heights could also be used to separate mixtures of beads that have different densities 9 . Although the levitation procedure described is clearly useful, its advantages and limitations still have to be defined. For example, the authors show that, at the mid-point of a reaction, a broader range of floating heights is obtained than at the beginning or end of the reaction. This could complicate some analyses. It also seems that, for the best results, the beads should all be the same size (which isn't always the case), and that traces of solvent adsorbed to the beads can affect the outcome of the assay. On the other hand, opportunities exist to optimize the technique, by designing synthetic processes or resins that maximize changes in density caused by reactions, or by devising an automated version of the method that uses optical sensors to monitor changes in the heights of floating beads \u2014 currently, the authors measure the heights by hand using a millimetre-scale ruler. Chemistry evolves through the invention of new reactions or catalysts, and less commonly through the discovery of new ways of doing things. Mirica and colleagues' gravimetric levitation analysis falls into the second category. Scientists who have the seemingly simple \u2014 but practically difficult \u2014 problem of monitoring the course of reactions on solid supports now have a new, easy way to do it.

But now a diversity-oriented synthesis can make 80 different molecular skeletons in just a few steps. Genome biology is shining a bright light on the origins of human disease. Unfortunately, the biological targets emerging as ideal points for therapeutic intervention are often viewed as being extremely difficult, if not impossible, to modulate with small molecules \u2014 which is a problem, because most drugs are small molecules. But is this view justified? Drug hunters search for candidates for drug-discovery programmes by screening large numbers of compounds in biological assays. Perhaps these collections simply lack compounds from structural classes that would modulate the targets identified by genomics studies 1 . Reporting in  Angewandte Chemie , Morton  et al . 2  describe an ingenious synthetic pathway that will help to populate screening collections with structurally diverse compounds. For many decades, organic chemists have searched for ways of making naturally occurring small molecules (known in the field as natural products). These objects of affection pose strategic challenges: can sequences of reactions be devised that turn simple, readily available compounds into more complex target compounds 3 ? In the more-notable successes, the resulting syntheses have provided insights into such fundamental areas as conformational analysis 4 , 5  (the study of the dynamic shapes of molecules), general principles of reactivity 6 , and biosynthesis and life's prebiotic origins 7 . Natural-product syntheses have on several occasions served as starting points for drug development 8 , and they have revealed gaps in the methods of organic synthesis, providing motivation to fill them 3 . But in recent years, synthetic targets have changed. Modern biology is gradually discovering how molecules such as transcription factors and regulatory RNAs are involved in disease. Such molecules are considered to be 'undruggable' targets, because they bear little resemblance to the approximately 500 targets of the current pharmacopoeia. In addition, as the functions of disease genes have been uncovered, they have suggested other processes (such as the changing of one type of cell in the body into another) or interactions (such as those between proteins, or between proteins and DNA) that might be targeted and/or disrupted by drugs. But these also fall into the 'undruggable' category. Natural products tend to modulate a limited set of targets that have general functions \u2014 cytoskeletal proteins that define the shapes of cells are common examples \u2014 but do not seem to modulate these other, more-specialized targets and processes. Chemists are therefore stepping in to make compounds that do. It is impossible to design such compounds from scratch. Instead, it is best to make a 'super-set' of compounds of such structural diversity that, for any given aspect of a biological process, members can be found that can modulate that aspect. When the super-set is screened in biological assays, compounds would thus be found that modulate even undruggable biological targets. Experience shows that successful programmes for drug discovery, or for finding molecular probes of biological processes, require that many thousands of compounds be available for screening. This makes it impractical to prepare each member of a super-set using its own, target-based synthesis pathway. Instead, flexible, modular syntheses must be devised that allow many structurally diverse compounds to be prepared efficiently. So which compounds should be prepared, and how should such a diversity-oriented synthesis be planned? The best, but most difficult, strategy is to make compounds in a way that anticipates problems at each step of the drug-discovery process in which organic synthesis is involved. As described above, the first such step involves finding a molecule that modulates a disease target or process. This requires thousands of structurally diverse compounds to be made for screening. The next step is to optimize the biological properties of the compounds found during screening. This involves making analogues of the compounds, each containing slightly different structural modifications \u2014 ideally, every atom in the compound should be modified, without an overwhelming synthetic effort. The final step involves synthesizing the optimal compound, either for use as a biochemical probe for research or as a drug in medicine, efficiently, at low cost and in large quantities. Historically, the pharmaceutical industry has dealt with each of these steps in a serial fashion, and the associated problems have been addressed independently. Each step is challenging and can create bottlenecks in the overall process. Diversity-oriented synthesis aims to address, if not overcome, all of these challenges before the first compounds have even been screened. Morton  et al . 2  implement a strategy for a diversity-oriented synthesis that might advance each of the above steps of the drug-discovery process. Their approach yields structurally novel and diverse products in high yields and of excellent purity \u2014 impressively, the authors made 80 different molecular 'skeletons'. Because the synthetic route is modular, many modifications can in principle be made to each skeleton simply by using different variants of the reactants at the first step. This is ideal for the optimization stage of drug discovery. Finally, the route contains only a small number of steps, which should make it adaptable for large-scale synthesis. The authors use the 'build\u2013couple\u2013pair' strategy of organic synthesis 9 , which entails preparing molecular building blocks that contain several chemical groups ( Fig. 1 ). Some of these groups react in the first step of the synthesis to couple the building blocks together. Once all the different blocks have been coupled, the remaining groups react with others found in the same intermediate molecule. The build\u2013couple\u2013pair strategy precisely mimics that used by nature in the biosynthesis of nearly all natural products, where it also allows structurally diverse products to be formed. Helpfully, Morton  et al . have designed the protocol of their diversity-oriented synthesis with a particular eye to making it simple to purify the compounds \u2014 this is a boon, because purification is usually the most labour-intensive part of any chemical reaction. The resulting products 2  differ from the compounds found in most small-molecule screening collections. Typically purchased from commercial vendors, the compounds in such collections frequently lack chirality and are structurally simple. This means that they can bind to only a small number of biological targets. The compounds in commercial libraries also tend to be structurally similar \u2014 their 'diversity' is limited to variations in appendages attached to a small number of common skeletons. This undesirable combination of properties means that, although enormous numbers of compounds (often more than a million) are frequently tested in screenings, at great expense, in the case of undruggable targets relatively few biologically active 'hits' are found. In principle, a smaller library of compounds that contains a more diverse range of molecular shapes, such as those made by Morton  et al ., would provide both more hits for less money, and hits for the more challenging biological targets. The structural complexity of natural products enables them to perform demanding biological tasks, and their structural diversity allows them to perform different tasks. The same is true of non-natural compounds produced using diversity-oriented synthesis and subsequently identified as small-molecule probes of protein\u2013DNA interactions 10 , protein\u2013protein interactions 11 , transcription-factor activity 12 , multi-drug resistance in pathogens 13  and many other processes often imagined to be impervious to modulation by small molecules. These results suggest that Morton and colleagues' synthetic pathway might also yield molecular probes of many aspects of disease. Diversity-oriented syntheses are growing in number and sophistication, and this study 2  will probably inspire even more advances in the area. The tremendous growth of small-molecule screening for biological research and drug discovery will provide additional clues to the contrasting biological activities of small molecules derived from diversity-oriented syntheses, from commercial libraries, and from nature. There remains an urgent need to understand better both the relationship of structural features of small molecules to screening outcomes and, more generally, the relationship of synthetic strategies to success in discovering probes for biological research and drugs for therapeutic interventions.

Teukolsky"}, {"name": "Ira Wasserman"}], "parsed_as_year": "2006_or_before", "body": "Multi-talented astrophysicist and public servant.  Edwin Ernest Salpeter, who perhaps more than anyone put the physics into astrophysics, died on 26 November 2008 at the age of 83. Among his many accomplishments was figuring out how giant stars burn helium to form carbon in the 'triple-alpha process' (named after the three helium nuclei \u2014 alpha particles \u2014 that fuse together in the process). Before this discovery, the origin of the elements beyond helium in the periodic table was a mystery. Salpeter was born on 3 December 1924 in Vienna. In 1939 his family fled to Australia after the Nazi takeover of Austria the previous year. He earned bachelor's and master's degrees at the University of Sydney, and then went to the University of Birmingham, UK, where he earned his doctorate in theoretical physics under the supervision of Rudolf Peierls in 1948. On Peierls' advice, he went to Cornell University in New York to work with fellow theoretical physicist Hans Bethe. He stayed at Cornell for nearly 60 years, and for most of this time occupied the same office assigned to him on his arrival. Salpeter's most important work from his early years at Cornell led to the Bethe\u2013Salpeter equation, which describes bound states of particles in quantum field theory. But despite his success in theoretical particle physics, Salpeter felt that he did not have the right talents or temperament for the subject. He started to look for a field that, in his own words, \u201cwas more controversial, more open-ended and new, where quick was useful and sloppy did not matter too much because it would all change soon anyway\u201d. He found it in astrophysics. In 1939, Bethe published his Nobel-prizewinning work showing how the conversion of hydrogen to helium powers main-sequence stars such as the Sun. He subsequently received much correspondence on the subject. When Salpeter became the most junior of Bethe's postdocs, he was often delegated to respond to this correspondence, sparking his interest in nuclear astrophysics. Beginning in 1951, Salpeter started spending summers at the Kellogg Radiation Laboratory of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, working with Bethe's friend, the nuclear experimentalist Willy Fowler. One of the key problems at the time was working out how elements heavier than helium ( 4 He) are generated in giant stars that have finished fusing hydrogen ( 1 H) to form helium. It was already known that there were no stable nuclei of atomic mass 5 or 8, and so there was no way that nuclei could form through the fusion of  1 H and  4 He, or through the fusion of two  4 He nuclei. Furthermore, the probability of three helium nuclei coming together directly to produce  12 C was much too low to be feasible. While studying Fowler's experimental data, Salpeter realized that the beryllium nucleus  8 Be \u2014 the fusion product of two helium nuclei \u2014 is actually metastable, and would exist in low concentrations inside red-giant stars. The  8 Be nucleus could therefore capture another helium nucleus to make  12 C. In 1997, Salpeter won the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences' Crafoord prize for his discovery of this triple-alpha process. He shared the award with the astronomer Fred Hoyle, who predicted that  12 C must have a specific energy-level structure for the rate of the process to correspond to the known temperature of giant stars. As the new field of nuclear astrophysics burgeoned, a vital question was how much heavy-element enrichment of the interstellar gas occurs when massive stars die. The answer hinges on how many stars of a given mass have been born \u2014 the 'initial mass function'. In 1955, Salpeter provided an answer to this crucial question as a simple power-law distribution. This \u201csloppy\u201d treatment has turned out to be remarkably good, and is still widely used today. Salpeter also showed how electron screening affects both thermonuclear reaction rates in stars and the equation describing the state of dense matter, such as in white dwarfs and planetary interiors. Whereas Salpeter's early research in astrophysics focused on questions related to stars, in the 1960s he began to study larger-scale problems in astronomy. Some of his most important work concerned the physical chemistry of interstellar gases, especially the condensation of the gases into dust grains, and the pivotal role of these grains as sites of chemical reactions. In the 1970s and 1980s, Salpeter turned towards still-larger scales of galaxies and the Universe, writing crucial papers on dark matter, on the rotational velocities of galaxies, and on the development of galaxy clusters and superclusters. Salpeter's work in astrophysics was characterized by a combination of 'broad-brush' semi-quantitative estimates, theoretical rigour and, always, attention to unexplained observations \u2014 some of which he, his students and his collaborators made themselves. But he often predicted new and unexpected phenomena while thinking about what might become observable. Perhaps his most famous prediction (also made independently by Yakov Zel'dovich in the Soviet Union) was made in 1964, when he predicted that black holes could be detected indirectly by the radiation emitted by gas accreting onto them. This has become a standard method for detecting black holes. Among his numerous contributions to public service, Salpeter's most important role was in the rigorous technical studies of anti-ballistic missile defence systems, starting in the 1960s. This impressed on him the limitations of such systems, and in the 1980s he participated in an influential study by the American Physical Society that debunked the feasibility of the 'Star Wars' Strategic Defense Initiative. Salpeter sparked some controversy by referring to the \u201cdishonesty without outright lies\u201d that pervaded the anti-ballistic missile defence community, then and now. Late in his career, Salpeter became increasingly interested in neurobiology, collaborating with his wife, Miriam (Mika, then professor of neurobiology and behaviour at Cornell University), on research into the interactions between nerves and muscle fibres. He also worked on epidemiology and the statistical analysis of clinical trials, both in collaboration with his daughter Shelley Salpeter, a physician, and recently with his grandson, Nicholas Buckley. Of this work, Salpeter said, \u201cMy switch to epidemiology was not as radical a change as you might think. Humans coughing tuberculosis mycobacteria into the air at different ages required similar mathematical treatment to stars of different lifetimes disbursing heavy elements into the interstellar medium.\u201d Salpeter trained many students during his magnificent career, including numerous faculty members at leading universities worldwide. And yet, no matter how eminent he became, Salpeter retained his modesty and sense of fun. Reprints and Permissions"},

Yet most of us have experienced this savoury flavour, and commonly associate it with oriental cuisine. Xiaodong Li and colleagues now reveal the molecular mechanism behind perception of the umami taste (F. Zhang  et al .  Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA  doi:10.1073/pnas.0810174106; 2008 ). The umami taste comes from the amino acid glutamate, although ribonucleotides such as IMP and GMP greatly enhance its intensity. Like the sweet taste, perception of this taste depends on G-protein-coupled receptors of class C (C-GPCRs), which are found in cell membranes and also include many receptors of physiological importance. In C-GPCRs, a 'Venus flytrap' (VFT) domain, which binds to ligands on the cell surface, is connected to a transmembrane domain. Although the receptors for the umami taste (consisting of T1R1\u2013T1R3) and the sweet taste (T1R2\u2013T1R3) share the same transmembrane subunit (T1R3), Li and colleagues show \u2014 using different combinations of these three subunits \u2014 that, in each case, the unique subunit mediates taste recognition. Moreover, four amino-acid residues deep inside the VFT domain seem to be essential for recognition of glutamate.  Enhancement of the umami taste by IMP/GMP, however, seems to depend on a different set of four amino acids in the opening to the VFT domain. So the authors propose that IMP binds near glutamate, supporting the ligand-bound, closed conformation of the VFT domain. Regulatory molecules such as IMP that modulate the activity of GPCRs are of great interest to the drug industry \u2014 for example, they are more selective than agonist molecules, which might affect the activity of related receptors. As there are few known naturally occurring examples of IMP-like regulatory molecules, the significance of Li and colleagues' results goes beyond unravelling the mysteries of a curious taste.

This response was produced by specific fibres. It was first thought that these 'water' fibres might serve a particular purpose in water regulation in amphibians living in fresh water. These findings also revived the old problem of whether warm-blooded animals and man possess similar specific taste fibres mediating what we might call a water taste. The late Prof. David Katz of Stockholm, who believed this to be the case, often asked in his examinations: What is the taste of water? The correct answer was 'wet' ... It seems to us most likely that water does not elicit any positive taste sensation. The action must be of negative character in that water abolishes or decreases the resting activity of taste fibres ...

The fact that it forms strong, bendable sheets \u2014 made from carbon atoms arranged in a honeycomb lattice \u2014 together with its remarkable electronic properties makes it a promising starting point for flexible electronic applications. However, the high-performance electronic graphene devices reported so far are made from tiny, micrometre-sized pieces of graphene, obtained using a rather cumbersome method that involves peeling off layers from a larger graphite substrate. In a paper published online in  Nature , Byung Lee Hong and his colleagues now describe an alternative and more versatile method to produce graphene films with excellent electronic properties and with large, centimetre-scale areas (K. S. Kim  et al .  Nature  doi:10.1038/nature07719; 2009 ). Although chemical-processing techniques already exist for producing large-area graphene material, the electronic properties of such materials have been disappointing. But Hong  et al . have perfected an approach known as chemical-vapour deposition. In this technique, a gaseous mixture of hydrocarbons flows over heated nickel foils and breaks down into atomic carbon, which in turn rearranges into graphene. Rapid cooling of the substrate then ensures that films just a few layers thick are formed. These ultrathin films are optically transparent and have high electrical conductivity, similar to that of mechanically cleaved graphene.  The main promise of Hong and colleagues' method lies in large-area applications, notably transparent, flexible electrodes such as that pictured. Hong  et al . show that the graphene films can be radically bent and stretched without affecting their optical and electronic properties. And crucially, with this fabrication method the graphene can be easily transferred to other materials, because the underlying nickel can simply be etched away and the graphene film picked up and placed elsewhere. In addition, nanoscale patterns can be made in the graphene films by pre-patterning the nickel substrate with standard lithography techniques. This combination of straightforward processing techniques and desirable properties increases the prospects of inexpensive, flexible and reliable electronic devices. Future applications, such as in photovoltaics, or as sensors and displays that are wearable or foldable, suddenly don't seem to require such a stretch of the imagination. Reprints and Permissions"},

Daniel Carleton Gajdusek, who won the 1976 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his discovery of transmissible dementias, died on 12 December 2008 in a hotel in Troms\u00f8, Norway. This isolated spot above the Arctic Circle was the winter refuge for American-born Gajdusek during the last 10 years of his life. He spent his summers mainly in Amsterdam. This migratory pattern, and his choice to spend winter in one of the darkest places on Earth, typified the eccentricity of the man. Gajdusek was born in 1923 in Yonkers, New York, where his father had a butcher's shop. As an eight year old, he already seemed to know his destiny. He told me once that he inscribed the names of all the scientists in Paul de Kruif's book  Microbe Hunters  \u2014 which included giants such as Robert Koch and Louis Pasteur \u2014 on the staircase to his attic chemistry lab, leaving the last step blank for himself. Gajdusek's mind was continuously attracted to the mysterious and exceptional, his rationale being that, to contribute to knowledge, you must find unexplained phenomena and observe them first-hand. From the early 1950s onwards, having trained as a research virologist, he recorded his scientific endeavours on film so that he could share his experiences as directly as possible with everybody. In 1954, Gajdusek shot a documentary entitled  Rabies in Man , which followed experiments at the Pasteur Institute of Iran in Tehran. The institute's director, Marcel Baltazard, had recently shown that almost a third of people who had suffered a rabid-dog bite to the head could not be saved by rabies vaccine. Baltazard considered this result disastrous. Gajdusek suggested that he should test anti-rabies antibodies (prepared from rabbit serum by Herald Cox in New York) in combination with the vaccine. Baltazard agreed to this, and in August 1954 he began using the combination therapy in 18 patients who had sustained head wounds from rabid wolves. Gajdusek's documentary meticulously followed their progress during treatment. The study showed convincingly that addition of rabies antibodies to the vaccine can completely protect people from disease or death after exposure to rabies virus. This regimen has been the gold standard of care for the disease ever since. Gajdusek's views on microbiology were shaped by the training in physical chemistry that he received from Linus Pauling, and by schooling in cell biology and virology from John Enders \u2014 both Nobel laureates. From 1955 to 1957, he also worked in Melbourne, Australia, with Frank Macfarlane Burnet, who received a Nobel prize in 1960 for his work on the recognition of 'self' by the immune system. His experiences in this vibrant field taught him to expect the unexpected, and prepared him for his greatest discovery. In 1957, Gajdusek travelled to New Guinea upon hearing that Vincent Zigas, a district medical officer, had stumbled across a mysterious illness \u2014 kuru \u2014 in the Fore tribe of the Highlands. This turned out to be a neurological disease affecting women and children. It progressed swiftly from an initially unsteady gait to tremors and speech disorders, leading within months to complete incapacitation, and invariably to death. Gajdusek suspected from the beginning that the disease was caused by a form of ritual cannibalism in which only women and children participated. In 1961, Gajdusek convinced Clarence Joseph Gibbs Jr, a specialist in insect-borne viruses, to lead a series of experiments designed to establish the concept of 'transmissible spongiform encephalopathies' (TSEs). Besides kuru, TSEs include neurodegenerative illnesses such as Creutzfeldt\u2013Jakob disease (CJD) and 'mad cow' disease. Gajdusek and Gibbs reported the successful transmission of kuru to chimpanzees in 1966, of CJD to chimpanzees in 1968, and of scrapie (the sheep variant of TSE) to monkeys in 1972. In later years, CJD was categorized with Alzheimer's disease as an amyloidosis (diseases characterized by the deposition of insoluble proteins), but Gajdusek and co-workers showed in 1980 that Alzheimer's disease, unlike CJD, was not transmissible. Gajdusek's work revealed the existence of a new kind of infectious agent, one that did not need a nucleic acid to replicate. Now called prions, these agents are misfolded proteins that can induce misfolding in other proteins. The initiation of misfolding falls in the twilight zone between normal and abnormal protein production, and is still not understood. The conspicuously unconventional Gajdusek had thus found a suitably eccentric infectious agent. The discovery won him a Nobel prize, and earned him the right to add his name to the staircase of the world's great microbe hunters. Eccentricity was the source of Gajdusek's genius as a scientist, and of his notoriety late in life. In 1997, he was imprisoned on a child molestation charge involving one of the more than 50 Micronesian and Melanesian children he had adopted and brought to the United States. On his release in 1998 he moved to Europe, which he regarded as less puritanical than his home country. Throughout his life, Gajdusek was a fervent reader of the world's literature and a prolific writer. He believed in a life of learning and in accurate documentation and reflection. An example of his acuity was his letter writing. When you wrote to him, you got your own letter back with an answer to each sentence scribbled between the lines. Around two months before his death, I had dinner with him at the Academic Club of the University of Amsterdam, about a minute's walk from his university lodgings. It took us at least 20 minutes to get there, stopping every minute to rest because of his failing heart. This cumbersome trip did not stop him from talking all the way about his most recent interest: the physical evidence in the brain revealing a person's reading ability and the development of that skill. He kept yelling at me, while gasping for air, that before the age of six a child could achieve native fluency in at least six, if not ten, languages, if properly exposed. He must have had his own youth in mind: Gajdusek could read at least ten languages. Gajdusek will be remembered for both his scientific contributions and his overwhelming presence. As Richard Rhodes observed in his book on TSEs,  Deadly Feasts , Gajdusek was \u201cA compulsive talker who spills ideas nonstop for hours \u2014 good talk, often brilliant talk and consummate story-telling, but more than some listeners can bear\u201d.

Yet this is exactly what Julia Fischer and her colleagues observed in mice lacking one specific gene (J. Fischer  et al .  Nature  advance online publication doi:10.1038/nature07848; 2009 ). Obesity is a complex disorder because, as well as environmental factors, many genes seem to be involved. One such gene is  FTO , as several studies have indicated that different versions of  FTO  are strongly correlated with body mass index: individuals carrying the high-risk version weigh roughly 3 kilograms more than those with the low-risk version. Fischer  et al . studied mice lacking  Fto  ( Fto \u2212/\u2212  mice) and compared them with normal mice and with those carrying only one copy of the gene ( Fto +/\u2212  mice). The absence of  Fto  did not affect embryonic development, but by six weeks after birth,  Fto \u2212/\u2212  mice weighed on average 30\u201340% less than normal or  Fto +/\u2212  mice. This reduction in weight was associated with a marked loss of white fat tissue, with near-complete loss by 15 months. The lower weight of the mutant mice doesn't seem to be due to reduced calorific intake. In fact, these mice ate more in proportion to their body weight than normal mice. Moreover, on a high-fat diet, both groups of mutant mice gained much less weight than normal animals. Instead,  Fto \u2212/\u2212  mice used more energy, while not moving much. The authors suggest that this increased energy expenditure might be due to higher activity of the sympathetic nervous system \u2014 that is, to enhanced circulating levels of adrenaline and noradrenaline. Fischer and colleagues' data indicate that variations in the human  FTO  gene might affect its levels of expression, either putting individuals at risk of obesity or protecting them from it. It remains to be seen how  FTO  might regulate the activity of the sympathetic nervous system. Reprints and Permissions"},

This common furze has a local reputation as a supplementary animal foodstuff ... No previous results are available on the carotene content of the green matter (spines) of furze and its seasonal variation, which are now reported ... From October to February or March \u2014 when furze is fed to stock \u2014 the average carotene content is 126 mgm./kgm., indicating that it is a very good, and freely available, source of carotene. The relatively high values during the summer months point to the possibility of using dried furze meal as a supplementary source of carotene in animal feeding. The problem of retention of carotene in dried furze is being investigated. From  Nature  13 June 1959. \n               100 Years Ago \n             The interesting problem of the dew-pond still awaits a definite solution. That these ponds are mainly fed by mist, and not dew, can hardly be doubted by anyone who has visited them at night, situated as they are on the topmost ridges of the Downs. In the driest summer the prevailing south-west wind, as it comes up from the sea, forms on these heights after dark thick clouds of mist, which soak everything that comes into contact with them ... The source of the water in these ponds, therefore, seems evident, but the mechanism by which the mist is precipitated into the ponds is not so apparent ... It appears to me that the only possible explanation is that the particles of mist must bear charges of electricity differing in potential from that of the earth. The charge on the earth would, of course, be most dense at the summits of the hills. Hence the tendency for the mist to deposit on the top of the ridge. From  Nature  10 June 1909.
