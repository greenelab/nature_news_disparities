Plowe"}], "parsed_as_year": "2006_or_before", "body": "A series of  in vitro , genomic, ecological and epidemiological studies has pinpointed gene mutations in the malaria parasite  Plasmodium falciparum  that play a key part in resistance to artemisinin-based antimalarial drugs.  See Article    p.50 A fragile consensus that the global eradication of malaria is possible, and prospects for eventually achieving this audacious goal, are being threatened by the emergence in southeast Asia of parasite resistance to the drug artemisinin and its derivatives. On  page 50  of this issue, Ariey  et al . 1  report welcome news: they have identified a molecular marker of artemisinin-resistant malaria that can be used to map resistance and guide efforts to eliminate it. Artemisinin-based combination treatments have contributed to reductions in the global burden of malaria, prompting the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and the World Health Organization to issue a call in 2007 for an international push towards malaria eradication 2 . Artemisinin drugs normally clear malaria parasites from the blood of a patient within two days of starting treatment; now, however, increasing numbers of  Plasmodium falciparum  infections in western Cambodia, southern Vietnam, eastern Myanmar and western Thailand take up to five days to clear. In some areas, artemisinin-based combination therapies are starting to fail completely, with persistence of both infection and clinical illness after what should be curative treatment. Efforts to contain artemisinin resistance in southeast Asia and to eliminate malaria would be aided enormously by the identification of a molecular marker for this drug resistance. Such markers are available for resistance to other antimalarial drugs for which the genetic determinants of resistance in the parasite are known. However, neither the mechanism of artemisinin action nor the mechanism(s) of resistance are understood. Examinations of the  P. falciparum  genome for regions of recent strong evolutionary selection, and targeted and genome-wide association studies, have implicated two adjacent regions on chromosome 13 as potential sites of a resistance-determining gene or genes 3 , 4 . Through dogged determination and a remarkable combination of approaches, Ariey and colleagues seem to have won the race to identify if not the gene, at the very least a key gene, responsible for artemisinin resistance. In what seemed like a long shot, the researchers laboriously grew an artemisinin-sensitive parasite isolated from a Tanzanian individual in culture for five years, exposing it intermittently to artemisinin. The drug was removed when the parasites' growth faltered, and replaced after they bounced back. After 60 cycles of drug pressure, the proportion of parasites surviving a pulse of artemisinin had increased from less than 0.01% to more than 10%. Genome sequencing of this population revealed eight single-nucleotide mutations (single nucleotide polymorphisms, or SNPs) in seven genes that were present in the resistant parasites but not in their siblings grown in a parallel culture without drug exposure. The suspects were cornered. The culprit was then identified when the authors looked for these candidate mutations in parasite lines from Cambodia that had varying susceptibilities to artemisinin drugs  in vitro 5 . After ruling out candidate genes from the Tanzanian isolate that showed no sequence variation in the Cambodian isolates, and genes containing SNPs that were not associated with  in vitro  resistance, a single gene remained with resistance-associated SNPs. The gene is located on chromosome 13, within a candidate region identified in a recent genome-wide association study of clinical artemisinin resistance 4 . The gene in question encodes a kelch protein called K13. Kelch proteins are involved in a variety of protein\u2013protein interactions, and contain several regions of repeating amino-acid sequences, each forming a 'propeller blade' ( Fig. 1 ). Further evidence for the central role of K13-propeller SNPs in resistance was provided by Ariey and colleagues' ecological survey of malaria parasites from several Cambodian provinces. K13-propeller mutations were rare or absent in samples from provinces with virtually no documented resistance, but were widespread in provinces where resistance has been reported. Moreover, their prevalence in these provinces has increased during the past decade, contemporaneously with increases in the prevalence of resistance. The authors went on to show that K13 SNPs were also strongly correlated with delayed parasite clearance following artemisinin treatment in clinical trials. And a final piece of evidence came from subpopulations of Cambodian parasites that can be segregated into sensitive and resistant groups 6 . The prevalence of K13 SNPs not only correlated with resistance among these subpopulations, they actually did a better job of explaining resistance than did population groupings: sensitive parasites assigned on the basis of their genomic profile to 'resistant' subpopulations had wild-type K13, and resistant parasites belonging to 'sensitive' subpopulations carried the SNPs. Definitive proof that K13-propeller mutations confer artemisinin resistance will come from genetic transformation of drug-sensitive parasites into resistant ones by the replacement of their wild-type  K13  gene with a mutated gene. It is of course possible \u2014 even probable \u2014 that other genes contribute to artemisinin resistance, but this study leaves little doubt that K13 is a major determinant of resistance to these drugs in  P. falciparum  malaria. Further study of gene variants in the chromosomal vicinity of the  K13  gene will ascertain whether resistance arose once in western Cambodia and then spread \u2014 in which case the genomic regions containing the K13 SNPs will show extended surrounding sequence similarity, indicating common ancestry \u2014 or whether it emerged independently in different geographical locales. If resistance has arisen independently in many areas, local containment efforts will be futile and only regional elimination offers any hope of preventing its spread to Africa, where the arrival of drug-resistant Asian parasites has previously led to marked increases in malaria hospitalizations and deaths 7 . Validation of this molecular marker of artemisinin resistance outside Cambodia will be easily achieved, and mapping of the marker throughout southeast Asia is already under way, thanks to early sharing of the results of this study with local malaria-control workers and researchers. With at least 17 SNPs residing in the propeller domains of K13, only one of which is found in any one parasite, sequencing of the  K13  gene will initially be necessary to map resistance. But if a few specific SNPs emerge as being predictive of resistance in different settings, switching to rapid molecular assays using DNA extracted from dried blood spots will accelerate translation of this research finding into a practical tool for public-health surveillance.

The subject ... whose personality is admittedly abnormal, is said to have trained herself to distinguish colours and forms by means of her fingers and to be able to read books and newspapers by digital scanning alone ... It has been shown, for example, that her reading is not impaired by interposing a plate of glass between the print and her fingers or by projecting the print on to a ground glass screen to exclude tactile sensation. It might, therefore, seem that the girl's fingers are genuinely sensitive to light ...

In \u201cCommentary\u201d he explains in more detail how common chromosomal abnormalities, such as those causing mongolism and intersexes, are produced; mentions theories dealing with the possibility of inherited cancer; touches on pharmacogenetics; and outlines the vast amount of genetic variability which is being shown up by the complicated polymorphisms of the blood proteins.

Using another model, Ferguson and colleagues tracked the development of melting at the rift, and found that thinning of the tectonic plate over the past 30 million years has been much less than expected. This suggests that an abrupt phase of plate thinning during the final stages of break-up would be required for an ocean basin to form in Afar. Reprints and Permissions"},

Erec Stebbins"}], "parsed_as_year": "2006_or_before", "body": "Analyses of the toxin produced by  Salmonella  Typhi bacteria reveal an unusual assembly of toxin subunits, and show that most symptoms of typhoid fever can be linked to one subunit's DNA-damaging activity.  See Letter    p.350 During the complex process of infection, nothing is more fascinating than the interplay between host immunity and pathogen virulence \u2014 particularly in asymptomatic carriers, who seem to be in perfect health while normally life-threatening organisms replicate within them. The most infamous such carrier was 'Typhoid Mary', a cook in the United States who infected more than 50 people with typhoid fever by passing on the causative bacterium  Salmonella  Typhi ( Fig. 1 ). Another perplexing feature of these bacteria is the existence of the closely related  Salmonella  Typhimurium, which does not cause life-threatening infections despite having apparently similar virulence properties to  S . Typhi. A paper by Song  et al . 1 , on  page 350  of this issue, places several key pieces in this puzzle. Footnote  1 . The story centres on one of the few obvious differences between  S . Typhi and  S . Typhimurium: the typhoid toxin, which was discovered almost 10 years ago and is specific to  S . Typhi 2 , 3 , 4 . Typhoid toxin has several features that set it apart from other bacterial toxins. It is known to be assembled from three subunits: CdtB and PltA (proteins with similarities to two disparate classes of bacterial toxins, the cytolethal distending genotoxins (CDT) and the ADP-ribosyl transferases of the pertussis toxin family, respectively), and PltB. But how this dual-activity toxin contributes to the pathogenesis of typhoid fever was, until now, unclear. Song and colleagues show that, in mice, typhoid toxin alone is sufficient to induce most of the symptoms associated with  S . Typhi infections, and that these effects are mediated by the DNA-damaging CdtB subunit of the toxin. The authors also show that the toxin is targeted to host cells by interactions with carbohydrate moieties on specific surface glycoproteins. This is a remarkable finding, because previous work had failed to provide a  raison d'\u00eatre  for CDT toxins in the pathogenesis of other bacteria that carry such proteins. The discovery that the symptoms of typhoid fever depend on CdtB of  S . Typhi is the first time that the virulence of an organism has been directly linked to the ability of bacteria to induce cellular DNA damage in a host. The second amazing insight from this study involves the architecture of the typhoid toxin, as revealed by the X-ray crystal structure described by the authors. The structure shows typhoid toxin to be a classic 'AB' type in its general assembly, possessing an active (A) subunit that achieves a biochemical result when a binding (B) subunit interacts with specific cellular receptors. The B subunit of typhoid toxin (PltB) is a homologue of one of the heteropentameric subunits of the pertussis toxin B subunits and, as expected, it pentamerizes with other B subunits. The PltA subunit nestles tightly in the cup that forms at one side of this pentameric disk (see Fig. 3 of the paper 1 ). However, in a striking departure from other known toxin structures, the CdtB subunit of typhoid toxin is not tightly integrated into the main structure, but is 'glued' onto it by a single disulphide bond to the PltA subunit. The authors find that this disulphide bond is crucial for toxin assembly, and that it creates an A 2 B 5  organization that has not been seen in any other bacterial toxin. This structure provides two disparate enzymatic activities, only one of which (the DNA-damaging activity) is required to recapitulate most typhoid symptoms. This unusual tethering of CdtB to PltA could represent a 'missing link' in toxin evolution, in which a factor that confers an advantage to an existing toxin is crudely conjugated in order to associate two cellular activities. Perhaps in several million years, a better-integrated multicomponent toxin will have replaced this one, but for now it is fascinating to obtain this snapshot of evolution in action. Much remains to be explained. For example, the role of the PltA subunit is not yet accounted for, and although typhoid toxin alone can reproduce many symptoms of typhoid disease, it does not cause the associated fever. However, this work, with its sweeping combination of atomic-resolution reductionism and organismal infection studies, has identified some of the key elements that underlie the unique properties of this pathogen. Our enhanced understanding of the role of the CdtB subunit in  S . Typhi virulence may open doors to new pharmacological interventions and improved vaccines for an infection for which there are no robust immunization approaches. Typhoid still takes the lives of several hundred thousand people a year 5 , 6 , 7 , and the rise of antibiotic-resistant strains of  S . Typhi could take us back to a situation in which individuals like Typhoid Mary pose a public-health threat. Research to improve our understanding of the disease and to develop treatments is an important undertaking. Correspondence to\n                 C. Erec Stebbins . Reprints and Permissions"},

See Letter    p.251 Among the vast pool of zoonotic viruses \u2014 those that can be transmitted from animals to humans \u2014 are the coronaviruses. These pathogens cause common colds and, rarely, more severe infections, and their entrances into the human population provide case studies in virus evolution and the emergence of infectious disease. A new coronavirus, designated hCoV-EMC, has appeared in humans in Middle Eastern countries and England on several occasions over the past year. Although only a few people have been infected, around half of them have died 1 . The identification of the receptor for this virus, reported by Raj  et al . 2  on  page 251  of this issue, will help us to understand how this and other coronaviruses can cross species borders. Coronaviruses made the headlines during the 2002\u201303 epidemic of human severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). The origin of the pathogenic human virus (SARS-CoV) that caused these infections was traced back to infected bats 3 . In expanding its range to humans, the SARS-like bat viruses evolved the capacity to latch onto human lung-cell receptors 4 . This probably came about through infections in intermediate host animals, in which genetic recombinations and small mutations generated a human-adapted virus that could no longer infect bat cells. The infrequency and requisite specificity of such events may partly explain why we have not seen another SARS-like coronavirus epidemic in the past decade. The emergence of hCoV-EMC, which is associated with severe respiratory disease, multi-organ failure and a high mortality rate in patients, has prompted intensive investigation into the virus's replication and cell-targeting strategies. Once again, its closest known relatives are viruses that infect various bat species 5 . However, in stark contrast to SARS-CoV, hCoV-EMC indiscriminately infects cells from many sources, including bats, pigs, monkeys and humans 6 . A polytropic coronavirus of this type is highly unusual and, from an epidemiological perspective, seems alarming. The suggestion is that hCoV-EMC has acquired facile interspecies transmissibility by adapting to evolutionarily conserved host-cell components \u2014 including host-cell receptors. Raj and colleagues' results validate this idea. They found that hCoV-EMC binds to DPP4 (also called CD26), a protein found on the surface of several cell types, including cells in the human airways. The amino-acid sequence of human DPP4 is very similar to its homologues in  Pipistrellus pipistrellus  bats, and the authors demonstrate that bat DPP4 also functions as a hCoV-EMC receptor ( Fig. 1 ). The sequence similarities extend to the DPP4s of other wild and domesticated animals, which increases the likelihood that dissemination of hCoV-EMC throughout nature involves the use of DPP4 for cell entry. Insight into whether hCoV-EMC has adapted to bind exclusively to an interspecies-conserved domain of DPP4 must await characterization of the binding interface, which will require mutational analyses of DPP4 and the glycoproteins on the hCoV-EMC surface. These analyses will be guided in part by comparisons with the closest known hCoV-EMC relatives \u2014 bat coronaviruses HKU4 and HKU5. In addition, X-ray crystallography of receptor-binding domains of viral proteins in complex with soluble DPP4 will be especially enlightening. Dissecting the hCoV-EMC receptor-binding domain and its interacting DPP4 domain in these ways may reveal opportunities for therapeutic blockade of virus entry into cells, including the development of vaccines based on the receptor-binding domains that can elicit antibodies able to interfere sterically with viral entry. Beyond the potential therapeutic applications, the identification of the hCoV-EMC receptor may also provide clues about the virus's pathogenesis. This is because the DPP4 receptor resembles the \u03b1-coronavirus receptor APN and the SARS-CoV receptor ACE2. All three receptors are ectopeptidase enzymes that cleave amino acids from biologically active peptides, thereby regulating an array of physiological responses. However, APN, ACE2 and DPP4 do not share obvious structural features, and their peptidase activities are not necessary for virus entry 7 , 8 . Coronavirus adaptation to ectopeptidase receptors may, therefore, simply reflect the abundance or subcellular positioning of these enzymes on airway cells. That said, once they have robustly infected a cell, viruses interfere with the presentation of such receptors at the cell surface, and decreased ACE2 levels during SARS-CoV infection are correlated with enhanced disease severity 9 . Further research to determine whether hCoV-EMC disease is similarly related to dysregulated DPP4-mediated physiological responses will address the intriguing hypothesis that aspects of coronavirus pathogenesis are outcomes of adaptation to ectopeptidase receptors. Knowing the identity of the hCoV-EMC receptor will also allow the development of animal models of infection to assess whether there are causal links between DPP4 levels, hCoV-EMC infection and disease. For example, an evaluation of DPP4 distribution in the lungs will help to show whether the receptors' location restricts hCoV-EMC infections to the lower respiratory tract, which might limit the virus's transmissibility. DPP4 is found on non-ciliated airway cells, whereas ACE2 is expressed by ciliated cells ( Fig. 1 ); such cell-target differences may contribute to the differences in transmissibility and pathogenicity of infections caused by hCoV-EMC and SARS-CoV. The potential for other factors \u2014 such as soluble DPP4, which may be abundant in extracellular fluids \u2014 to preclude infection and disease should also be tested. Moreover, DPP4 is known to have roles in recruiting protective immune responses in the host 10 ; as such, the effects of virus-induced receptor dysregulation may feature prominently in elucidating immunopathological aspects of the disease. Although hCoV-EMC can be transmitted from human to human, fortunately this seems to occur infrequently. Further epidemiological studies should assess whether the human infection is truly rare and always severe or, alternatively, is widespread but generally mild and therefore not detected. Similar epidemiological considerations apply to animals. Although the immediate implication of Raj and colleagues' findings might be to postulate a direct transmission from bats to humans, the conservation of the DPP4 receptor among species also raises questions about the extent of hCoV-EMC in nature and the most proximal animal source of the human infections. The interesting and perhaps troubling findings from studies of this virus thus far are that there may be a plethora of sources for its intrusion into the human population. Is this the case, or are there distinct interspecies barriers to hCoV-EMC infection? If so, what is the nature of the barriers, and how might the virus adapt to cross them and occupy the human-host niche? Virus adaptations involve much more than evolving new receptor-binding domains and so, in further studies of this emergent pathogen, it will be important to consider other genetic determinants of hCoV-EMC transmission to humans, such as virus interactions with the innate immune system.

All the errors he mentioned were fairly easy to spot, easy to correct, and of a kind which the teacher could easily mark; but they were all irrelevant to the main problem of helping scientists to write better English and express themselves more fluently. The damage is done in the classes called 'English', and is not the fault of science teachers who accept low standards ... One is led to suspect that a teacher of English can hope to find only the superficial deficiencies in scientific English unless he learns more about the subject-matter. Perhaps Mr Kirkman is right after all in passing responsibility to the science teachers because most English teachers cannot bear it.

But analysis of broadly acting, potent human antibodies obtained from single cells suggests a rational approach to vaccine development.  See Article    p.469 Our understanding of how humans respond to HIV has been revolutionized by the introduction of techniques for isolating anti-viral antibodies from single cells 1 . Such methods have led to the discovery of naturally occurring, potent antibodies that can neutralize a broad range of HIV viruses, and prevent 2  and suppress 3  infection. These findings, combined with the association between antibody responses and protection from infection that was identified in a human trial 4  of the vaccine RV144, have re-invigorated the quest for antibody-based HIV vaccines. However, it has also become clear that anti-HIV antibodies undergo unusually high levels of mutation 1 , 5 , which represents a potential stumbling block for vaccine development. Among four recent studies 6 , 7 , 8 , 9  that address this subject is a paper in this issue, in which Liao  et al . 9  ( page 469 ) track antibody and viral evolution during one patient's response to HIV Footnote  1 . Antibodies are produced by the B lymphocytes of the immune system. The receptors on the surface of each circulating B cell are unique, enabling an immune response to any foreign structure. When a B cell encounters an entity that matches its receptor, it is stimulated to proliferate and secrete antibodies against that structure. Although B-cell genes frequently undergo somatic (non-germline) mutation to increase the affinity of the antibodies they produce, anti-HIV antibodies are unusual in that they are highly somatically mutated \u2014 they are therefore quite different from those encoded by the B cells that initially respond to the infection 1 , 10 . Furthermore, these mutations seem to be required for the antibodies to bind to heterologous viral-envelope proteins (those expressed on most HIV viruses) 5 , 10 . If B cells that express the germline antibody precursor do not bind to the antigen, how are they stimulated in the first place, and why do the antibodies need so many mutations? Answering these questions is of fundamental importance in attempts to reproduce this antibody-development process by vaccination. Some patients with HIV develop broadly neutralizing antibody activity, but only 2\u20134 years after infection. Scrutiny of the antibodies produced by single human B cells 1  showed that these broadly neutralizing responses are due to a combination of antibodies in some individuals, and to single, potent antibodies in others 2 . In an attempt to dissect the natural pathways that lead to the generation of these antibodies, Liao  et al . studied a patient who developed broad and potent antibodies. The authors investigated the co-evolution of the HIV-1 virus and the broadly neutralizing antibodies for 34 months from the start of the infection. They isolated a virus-specific antibody named CH103, and clonal variants of it, from single memory B cells that were obtained using a fluorescently tagged viral-envelope protein as bait 3 , 5 , 11 . CH103 neutralizes 55% of HIV-1 isolates and targets the site on the virus that binds to CD4 molecules on the surface of T cells (the immune cells that HIV infects). Like other antibodies in this class 5 , 11 , CH103 is highly somatically mutated, and its unmutated germline precursor fails to bind to heterologous HIV-1 envelope proteins 9 . One of Liao and colleagues' key findings is that the germline precursor antibody of CH103 has high affinity for the envelope protein expressed by the founder virus that infected the individual. The authors suggest that a progenitor B cell that expresses this germline antibody might only be stimulated to respond if it is presented with the envelope proteins of the founder virus, or similar proteins. The idea that certain envelope proteins are more likely to induce broadly neutralizing antibodies is supported by experiments in macaques showing that specific envelopes induce such responses to simian HIV, whereas others do not 12 . However, simply initiating the antibody response is not sufficient for effective immune defence. It takes time and unusually large numbers of somatic mutations for antibody breadth and potency to develop. Liao  et al . reconstructed the CH103 clonal lineage by using samples that went back to the time of infection. Although all members of the lineage recognized and neutralized the founder virus, the affinity and neutralizing activity against heterologous viruses gradually increased through the accumulation of somatic mutations. The authors also found that, as previously described for glycan-dependent broadly neutralizing antibodies 13 , viral diversification and the emergence of 'escape mutants' (those with mutations in the site targeted by the antibody) preceded the development of antibody breadth. By studying a crystal structure of the CH103 antibody in complex with its envelope protein target, Liao  et al . showed that HIV escapes antibody pressure by mutating amino-acid residues in and around the CD4 binding site. These resistant viruses then elicit further somatic mutation and 'affinity maturation' of CH103 antibody variants, resulting in greater neutralization breadth of the antibody response. The reason for the high level of somatic mutation required to produce broadly acting, potent anti-HIV antibodies has recently been investigated 6 . Under normal circumstances, high affinity of an antibody for its target is usually achieved after the accumulation of 10\u201315 mutations in the complementarity-determining region of the antibody that forms the antigen contact site. However, broad and potent anti-HIV antibodies contain 40\u2013100 somatic mutations 1 , 5 , 6 , 11  that span both the complementarity-determining region and the relatively constant, and mutation-resistant, framework regions. Experiments in which mutations in the framework regions were selectively reverted showed that these mutations are necessary for the evolution of broad and potent anti-HIV antibodies 6 . These structural alterations in the antibody were found to contribute to direct contacts with the virus and to enhanced flexibility of the antibody structure, both of which are required for optimal breadth and potency. Combined with Liao and colleagues' findings, these data suggest a molecular explanation for why broadly neutralizing anti-HIV antibodies take 2\u20134 years to develop. Moreover, they indicate that an effective vaccine may require shepherding of B-cell responses through multiple rounds of the natural antibody maturation and mutation process, using naturally derived viral envelopes that induce the production of broad and potent antibodies in people with HIV. A recently suggested 7 , 8 alternative, non-mutually exclusive approach is to design specific 'immunogen' molecules that would bind to and activate B cells that produce the germline precursors of broadly neutralizing antibodies. Whether such roadmaps can be used to design effective vaccine strategies has yet to be determined, but they present a strong and testable route to addressing the main challenges of creating an antibody-based HIV-1 vaccine.

By Prof. V. C.

The author further postulates that this end-result of evolution has been brought about in the past not by individual natural selection, but by group selection of populations ...

The advance opens the door to applications in drug delivery and tissue engineering.  See Letter    p.651 The diverse physiology of cells and tissues is underpinned by materials consisting of macromolecules whose mechanical behaviour allows organisms to control and maintain their shape 1 . The construction of synthetic versions of these materials could allow artificial cells and tissues to be made, but preparing such materials has long been a major challenge. On  page 651  of this issue, Kouwer  et al . 2  report that they have produced the first synthetic polymers whose rigidity can be tuned to mimic that of a wide range of their biological counterparts. The authors' achievement will facilitate the construction of polymer networks that have highly tunable, force-responsive behaviour Footnote  1 . Synthetic polymers, such as polyethylene, nylon and silicone, were an important class of material in the twentieth century, finding diverse applications as paints, adhesives, fibres and plastics. But these polymer molecules behave rather like cooked spaghetti, because they have little rigidity along their length. Their flexibility is entirely due to the randomization of the polymer chains' configurations by thermal energy \u2014 the energy available to act on molecules at ambient temperature. Biological polymers, which are formed from amino acids or nucleic acids, are very different. These materials are ubiquitous in nature, and include DNA; cytoskeletal filamentous proteins, such as actin, microtubules and intermediate filaments; and scaffolding molecules in the extracellular matrix, such as collagen and fibrin. Biological polymers are much more rigid than chemical polymers, and so are similar to partially cooked spaghetti. Because of this high rigidity, the energy required to bend biological polymers is comparable to that available from thermal energy, such that they bend much less than synthetic polymers at ambient temperature. This inherent rigidity makes the mechanical behaviour of biological polymers at the bulk scale qualitatively different from that of synthetic polymers 3 . Kouwer and colleagues have discovered that polyisocyanopeptide polymers, grafted with flexible side chains of a different polymer, serve as mimics of a protein structure known as a \u03b2-sheet, and self-assemble into helical structures similar to those formed by DNA and actin filaments. Moreover, the authors report that the polymers aggregate into bundles when heated in solution ( Fig. 1 ), similar to the bundles formed by collagen and fibrin. One way to characterize the rigidity of a material is through its persistence length: the higher the persistence length, the more rigid the polymer. The persistence length of biological polymers varies from about 100 nanometres for DNA to 1 millimetre for microtubules; by comparison, the effective persistence length of a flexible synthetic polymer is typically about 0.1 nm. When the authors characterized the mechanical properties of their polymers using force-spectroscopy techniques, they found that single polymer chains had a sizeable persistence length, 500 nm. They also found that this increased for larger bundles, consistent with the idea that rigidity correlates with bundle diameter. Kouwer and co-workers' materials therefore represent the first semi-flexible synthetic polymers to have tunable persistence lengths, and so might serve as building blocks for biomimetic materials. One of the main consequences of increasing polymer rigidity is that it alters the mechanical response of crosslinked networks of the polymer. The mechanical rigidity of a material is described by a parameter known as the elastic modulus. For networks of flexible polymers (such as rubber), the elastic modulus depends only weakly on the density of the polymers or crosslinker connections. By contrast, in networks of semi-flexible polymers, the elastic modulus depends more strongly on these parameters 3 . A second characteristic of networks of semi-flexible polymers is that their response to stress is highly nonlinear 3 . Under increasing loads, conventional polymeric materials simply stretch until they break. Networks of semi-flexible polymers, however, stiffen under increasing load and have an elastic modulus that increases dramatically at a critical strain. Both of these distinctive properties of semi-flexible networks are typical of biological polymers, and are also found in Kouwer and colleagues' synthetic polymers. Because of their unusual mechanics, the authors' materials are highly responsive to applied stress: as the applied stress increases, the elastic modulus also increases to minimize changes in deformation. This suggests that the materials will maintain their shape when subjected to a wide range of externally applied stresses. What's more, the polymers' highly tunable rigidity means that tiny quantities of polymer could be used to make materials that have a wide range of stiffnesses. Kouwer and colleagues' polymers most closely mimic those found in intermediate filaments ( Fig. 1 ), a class of intracellular polymer that is crucial for cell adhesion and migration and for maintaining cell shape 4 . It will be exciting to see if the authors' approach, or other approaches for making semi-flexible polymers, can be expanded to make synthetic mimics of DNA, actin filaments and microtubules. Another challenge will be to find a way of adding mechanochemically active components 5  \u2014 those that transform chemical energy into mechanical work \u2014 to the polymer. This would enable filaments to be made that exhibit exotic polymerization behaviour, such as treadmilling (in which one end of a filament grows while its other end shrinks), or which create dynamic instabilities or crosslinks, to form the basis of a molecular motor. The ability to build 'active' soft materials that respond to external chemical and mechanical signals will provide opportunities in the areas of condensed-matter physics and materials science for years to come. Such materials might allow the construction of artificial cells and tissues that are more closely compatible physiologically with their counterparts in humans than currently available materials, so that they might be used in the next generation of drug-delivery and tissue-engineering technologies. Active soft materials might also change the way in which we engage with the physical world, by forming the basis of highly responsive and malleable materials and machines. Kouwer and co-workers' polymers are an exciting first step in these directions. Correspondence to\n                 Margaret Lise Gardel . Reprints and Permissions"},

In this issue, Senyuk  et al . explore how topology affects the alignment of micro-scale particles suspended in a 'nematic' host matrix \u2014 a liquid crystal in which the molecules are aligned but do not form well-defined planes ( B. Senyuk  et al .  Nature   493 , 200\u2013205; 2013 ). The particles in naturally occurring colloids \u2014 systems of tiny particles of one material suspended in a different material \u2014 are often spheres or faceted crystals. Such particles are said to have a topology of genus ( g ) zero. To explore the effects of different topologies on colloid particles, Senyuk  et al . synthesized particles constructed from rings 5\u201310 \u03bcm in diameter. These ranged from simple hoops ( g  = 1) to 'Olympic rings' ( g  = 5; pictured). The authors found that when the particles were dispersed in a nematic liquid crystal, they typically aligned with their ring planes perpendicular to the direction of alignment of the liquid crystal (the 'director'). Each particle of genus  g  generated at least  g  \u2013 1 defects in the liquid-crystal matrix, in agreement with topological theorems. These were either point defects in the rings' holes, or loop defects that could run around the inside or outside of the rings. What's more, the orientation of the liquid-crystal molecules around each particle was dictated by the particle's topology. Senyuk and co-workers went on to show that the particles could be aligned parallel to the director by melting and rapidly cooling the surrounding liquid crystals. In this case, defects appeared in the liquid crystal both within and next to the particles. And by applying an electric field at different rates, the authors could switch either the orientation of the colloidal particles or the configuration of the liquid-crystal molecules around the particles; the resulting states were stable when the electric field was removed. Finally, the researchers found that the particles diffused more easily along the nematic director than in other directions, and that the rate of diffusion decreased with increasing genus number. Taken together, these findings open up fresh opportunities for colloidal organization and self-assembly, as well as potential applications \u2014 in electro-optic or photonic devices, for example.

There is a fear and distrust of scientists, as people who ought to be above human fallibility but unforgivably err like everyone else; and he points out the dangers also of the responsibility for major decisions resting in the hands of men who do not know sufficient about science to be able to challenge with any confidence the advice that comes to them from their experts. There is something in this, although one would feel that a knowledge of men and a flair for consulting the right experts is what brings men to high office. \n               From  \n               Nature \n                2 February 1963 \n             \n               100 Years Ago \n             'Luminous halos surrounding shadows of heads' \u2014 The phenomenon referred to ... can also be seen on grass when the sun is low in the sky ... If the grass surface is near to the observer, a faint halo is seen to surround the shadow of his head, and this is more easily perceived if he is moving than if standing still; my attention was indeed first attracted to this phenomenon when bicycling.  J. Evershed I happened to be watching our shadows as we passed along the edge of a field of young green wheat, when, to my surprise, I noticed a halo of light round the shadow of my own head and neck ... The fact that each observer sees only his own halo obviously precludes this phenomenon from having been the origin of the halos recorded in sacred writings round the head of Christ and others.  L. L.

Gray"}], "parsed_as_year": "2006_or_before", "body": "The discovery of many new species of hepaciviruses and pegiviruses, which exhibit enormous genetic diversity, in wild rodent and bat populations might help us to understand the origins of the hepatitis C virus. The hepatitis C virus does not give up its secrets lightly. Despite infecting about 3 out of every 100 people worldwide, a small proportion of whom consequently develop severe liver disease, the virus eluded discovery for decades. It was eventually identified in 1989 as the cause of 'non-A, non-B hepatitis'. Researchers who have since sought the origins of hepatitis C virus (HCV), as it is now known, have been frustrated in equal measure. The virus infects chimpanzees in the laboratory, but studies of wild and captive primates uncovered no evidence of an animal population that might have transmitted HCV to humans 1 , contrasting with the success of other surveys that exposed close relatives of HIV-1 and human malaria in great apes 2 . Now, however, Kapoor  et al . 3  and Quan  et al . 4 , writing in  mBio  and  Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , respectively, report a diverse and widespread array of HCV-like viruses in wild populations of rodents 3  and bats 4 . Although none of these viruses can yet be claimed as the source of HCV, their discovery may represent the beginning of the end of the search for HCV's origins. HCV belongs to the  Hepacivirus  genus of viruses, whose closest taxonomic neighbour is the  Pegivirus  genus 5 ; the newly discovered bat and rodent viruses include members of both groups. Kapoor  et al . found five provisional virus species among more than 400 blood samples from four North American rodent species. Quan and colleagues describe 11 virus lineages from around 1,700 samples taken from 58 bat species collected in Mexico, Bangladesh and sub-Saharan Africa. The most notable property of the new viruses is their exceptional genetic heterogeneity, which dwarfs the diversity of all previously known hepaciviruses and pegiviruses, including HCV, which is itself highly variable. This diversity strongly implicates bats and rodents as natural and ancestral hosts for viruses of both genera, an idea supported by the comparatively high frequency of infection in wild animals (around 5%) and by Quan and colleagues' observations that some bats were co-infected with multiple viruses. Furthermore, all the infected bats seemed healthy when collected, which is consistent with a long evolutionary association between virus and host. But despite their already remarkable diversity, the viruses were isolated from approximately 5% of bat and less than 1% of rodent species known, and thus probably represent only a fraction of hepaciviruses and pegiviruses present in nature. Before these reports, the hepaciviruses and pegiviruses were known as sparsely populated genera that between them contained fewer than ten species, isolated from a motley collection of hosts: humans, chimpanzees, horses, dogs, wild and captive New World primates, plus one bat pegivirus found 6  in 2010. The discovery of enormous viral genetic diversity in bats and rodents presents the possibility that each of the formerly identified species arose through successful cross-species transmission of a bat or rodent virus. Indeed, it is estimated that a quarter of recently emerged human pathogens originated from rodents or bats 7 , and both animal groups are abundant, widely distributed and live in large numbers near human settlements or domesticated animals. This postulated cross-species transmission need not have been direct, but may have occurred through an intermediate host in even closer contact with humans \u2014 civet cats had such a role in the transfer of the SARS coronavirus to humans 8 , and pigs in the transfer of the Nipah virus 9 , both of which originate in bats. Although none of the new hepaciviruses and pegiviruses are sufficiently genetically similar to those found in humans or other animals to be declared their immediate source, bats and rodents are now prime suspects in the hunt for the ultimate origins of HCV. Further sampling of small-mammal populations worldwide should reveal the true diversity and host range of these viruses, and may uncover viruses more similar to HCV. Three possible outcomes of such sampling can be imagined: new viruses are found but none are closely related to HCV and its origin remains unresolved ( Fig. 1a ); viruses more similar to HCV than to equine hepacivirus, HCV's closest known relative, are found, suggesting that all HCV strains arose from a single successful ancestral transfer to humans ( Fig. 1b ); or viruses are found that group within the current genetic diversity of HCV, indicating that it arose from two or more independent cross-species transmissions ( Fig. 1c ). The third hypothesis is particularly intriguing as it potentially solves the enigma of 'endemic' HCV transmission: how some rural populations in central Africa and southeast Asia come to bear a range of divergent HCV strains, indicative of centuries of stable human-to-human transmission, in the absence of any consistently effective and widespread route of transmission. This riddle would be answered if the virus diversity originates not in humans but from an animal reservoir. Although the immediate consequences of the current findings for human health seem minimal, only detailed investigation of the transmission and ecology of the new viruses in their natural hosts can elucidate their true potential for cross-species transmission. The ongoing emergence in humans of coronaviruses of probable bat origin 10 , ten years after the successful eradication of SARS, is a timely reminder of the potential benefits to epidemiology and public health of understanding the dynamics of infectious disease in wild animal populations.
