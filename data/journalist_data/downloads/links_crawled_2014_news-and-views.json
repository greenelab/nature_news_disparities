The evidence seems fairly clear that television does not stimulate interest or broaden horizons to any greater degree than would happen in its absence ... Several studies show that the heavy use of escapist material is associated with tendencies to anxiety, social maladjustment and frustration ... There appears to be no evidence that television makes children passive and there is little to make us believe that violent programmes on television reduce the likelihood of violence in real life ... On the whole the weight of evidence is behind the conclusion that the heavy dosage of violence in the mass media, while not a major determinant of crime or delinquency, heightens the probability that someone in the audience will act aggressively in a later situation. \n               From  \n               Nature \n                2 January 1965 \n             \n               100 Years Ago \n             Plague and Pestilence in Literature and Art .

Cheung"}, {"name": "Michael Otto"}], "parsed_as_year": "2006_or_before", "body": "The finding that protein A of  Staphylococcus aureus  diverts the immune response so that it ineffectively responds to other structures from the bacterium explains the failure of ongoing attempts to develop working  S. aureus  vaccines. Staphylococcus aureus  is a global pathogen of great importance, causing thousands of deaths each year in the United States alone. The main problems with  S. aureus  infections are frequent resistance to antibiotics and the large repertoire of molecules produced by the pathogen to subvert human immune defences 1 , 2 . Notably, there is no protective immunity towards  S. aureus , meaning that previous  S. aureus  infection does not defend an individual against subsequent infections. Writing in the  Journal of Experimental Medicine , Pauli  et al . 3  describe a mechanism by which one  S. aureus  molecule, protein A, overwhelms the host's immune machinery through excessively stimulating certain immune responses while suppressing reactivity toward other key virulence determinants of the bacterium. These findings explain the weak protective immune responses and lack of immunological memory observed with  S. aureus  infections. The human immune system has two ways to combat bacterial invaders. One is innate immunity, so-called because the response mechanisms involved do not require adaptation; rather, the immune cells recognize structures that are evolutionarily conserved among pathogens, resulting in the pathogens' quick elimination.  S. aureus  has a large repertoire of 'weapons' to subvert this aspect of human immune defence \u2014 such as toxins that kill white blood cells \u2014 and the battle between the bacterium and the innate immune response determines whether an  S. aureus  invasion develops into a longer-lasting infection. The other system is adaptive immunity, which mostly involves T cells and B cells. In B cells, adaptive immune responses lead to genetic rearrangements that result in differentiation into plasma cells, which produce antibodies that are specific to certain structures (antigens) and that trigger mechanisms to remove the pathogens expressing those structures. About 10% of plasma cells survive after an infection is cleared; these 'memory B cells' provide protective immunity against further infections with the same pathogen. Adaptive responses kick in about a week after the initial infection and normally provide long-lasting immunity. In the case of  S. aureus , the role of adaptive immunity is poorly understood, but it is clear that long-lasting protective memory is not generated. This is not only reflected by recurring  S. aureus  infections, but also by the fact that vaccine development against  S. aureus  has always failed at the stage of clinical trials 4 . Although the mechanisms underlying this situation are still being unravelled, protein A, which is located on the surface of  S. aureus  cells, is believed to have a key role. Protein A contains repetitive sequences consisting of two parts: one binds to the Fc (constant) part of human antibodies and the other binds to the Fab (variable) antibody region. This Fab-region binding is 'superantigenic', meaning that it is nonspecific and has excessive potential to stimulate immune responses 5 . Binding of protein A to the Fc region was reported many years ago 6  and results in what has been called a 'camouflage coat' of nonspecific antibodies on the  S. aureus  surface that prevents binding of specific antibodies and thus a targeted immune response. Pauli  et al . 3  now show that the superantigenic binding of protein A to the Fab domain is so overwhelming that it strongly hampers the production of antibodies to other  S. aureus  antigens ( Fig. 1 ). To reach this conclusion, the authors characterized the antigen specificity of plasmablasts \u2014 an immature form of plasma B cells that are produced only during infections and that play a crucial part in active immune responses \u2014 in large cohorts of people with and without  S. aureus  infections. They found that, in principle, nothing was wrong with the plasmablast response in the infected individuals, inasmuch as the cells underwent normal maturation on exposure to  S. aureus  antigens. However, when the investigators isolated the antibody-encoding genes of the responding plasmablasts, they found that almost all targeted protein A, and very few were specific for other  S. aureus  toxins or cell-surface virulence determinants. On the basis of these results, Pauli  et al . propose that the superantigenic action of protein A prevents the production of specific and effective antibodies to other  S. aureus  antigens. Unfortunately, mouse models cannot be used to substantiate this proposal, because the murine immune response differs considerably in details of adaptive immunity that matter in this case 7 . However, it has been shown in a mouse model that protein A contributes significantly to immune evasion 8  and that monoclonal antibodies against protein A neutralize the Fc-binding and Fab-binding activities of protein A 9 . These studies suggest that protein A would be a valuable target for the development of vaccines against  S. aureus . However, it is commonly thought that a successful  S. aureus  vaccine will need to be multivalent \u2014 in other words, it will need to target several of the many molecules that the bacterium uses for virulence and immune evasion. For example, the vaccine should also include strategies to address the fact that  S. aureus  produces several toxins that can circumvent immune elimination even when specific antibody responses are mounted 10 . Pauli and colleagues' findings suggest that, by adding protein A-specific components in such preparations, we may finally be able to develop a working  S. aureus  vaccine.

Moore"}], "parsed_as_year": "2006_or_before", "body": "A high-resolution crystal structure of the HIV-1 Env trimer proteins, in their form before they fuse with target cells, will aid the design of vaccines that elicit protective immune responses to this protein complex.  See Article    p.455 The surface of the HIV-1 virus is studded with envelope glycoprotein (Env) spikes. The virus uses these trimeric complexes, which each contain three gp120 and three gp41 subunits, to fuse with cells and initiate infection. Sixteen years ago, Kwong and colleagues described the crystal structure of the core of the gp120 subunit 1 , but the lability of the complex in its pre-fusion form meant that the trimer structure was not determined until last year, when an engineered, stabilized and soluble version was used to produce highly concordant structures by X-ray crystallography 2  and cryo-electron microscopy 3 . Now, on  page 455  of this issue, Kwong and colleagues (Pancera  et al .) 4  report a crystal structure of the same Env trimer at higher resolution, providing a better picture, particularly of the gp41 subunits. Together, these structures 2 , 3 , 4  help us to understand how the Env trimer functions, how antibodies recognize it (or not), and how vaccines exploiting this protein can be better designed. HIV-1 fusion occurs when the gp120 components of Env trimers interact first with CD4 receptors on a cell's surface and then with a co-receptor (CCR5 or CXCR4). The sequential receptor engagements drive the concerted disentanglement of the intimate, but fragile, embrace between gp120 and gp41. The ectodomain of each gp41 subunit (the region that extends out from the viral membrane) contains six segments (A\u2013F) that form two heptad-repeat regions (HR1 and HR2). These segments eventually become two long helices in the post-fusion structure, which is known as the six-helical bundle. Pancera and colleagues' pre-fusion structure shows that HR1 and HR2 are each split up into two smaller helices connected by loops; together, the four helices form a ring encircling the amino and carboxy termini of gp120 ( Fig. 1 ). In turn, these gp120 regions act as a 'safety pin' to prevent gp41 from transiting to the energetically more favoured six-helical-bundle form. The authors use their structure to make inferences about the conformational changes in Env proteins that take place during fusion, adding detail to the existing model of the process ( Fig. 1b ). When the cellular receptors are engaged, the safety pin is removed in a two-stage process. First, the top of the trimer opens up. The diminished constraints on the N-terminal segments of gp41 and the space vacated at the trimer axis allow segment B to undergo a loop-to-helix transition. The formation of the resulting long helix (HR1), now containing segments A, B and C, punches the hydrophobic fusion peptide at the N terminus of gp41 into the target-cell membrane. The concomitant removal of one component of the four-helix ring weakens the links between gp120 and gp41. Co-receptor binding then fully removes the safety pin. The gp120 subunit probably now completely dissociates, eliminating any remaining steric constraints on the melding of the viral and cell membranes. In gp41, segments D\u2013F extend to form the second long helix (HR2), and the formation of the six-helical bundle provides sufficient energy to fuse the membranes. Once enough individual trimers (probably around five 5 ) have undergone these transitions, the resulting fusion pore in the cell membrane allows the viral core to enter the cell. The human immune system can prevent HIV-1 from infecting cells by generating neutralizing antibodies that bind to various regions (epitopes) on the pre-fusion Env trimer. But the virus has evolved defences to evade both the generation and the binding of neutralizing antibodies. The most relevant are a dense array of protective glycans, which are less immunogenic than protein surfaces, and the ability to vary the trimer's amino-acid composition. Pancera and colleagues' structure displays just how efficient these obstacles are: one stunning image (see Fig. 6 in the Extended Data) shows the comprehensiveness of the shielding effect of its glycans compared with analogous proteins from influenza virus and respiratory syncytial virus. Even so, humans can produce antibodies that have extremely broad reactivity against circulating HIV-1 variants. Most known epitopes targeted by such broadly neutralizing antibodies (many of these epitopes include the otherwise protective glycans) are present on the engineered BG505 SOSIP.664 trimers used to generate the existing and new Env structures 2 , 3 , 4 , 6 . Because inducing such antibodies is a major goal of HIV-1 vaccine development, does this mean that the problem is solved? Unfortunately, no \u2014 or, at least, not yet. There are two main elements in the development of vaccines based on Env: making immunogenic proteins with epitopes that could elicit broadly neutralizing antibodies, and forcing the immune system to respond to them. Current trimer-based immunogens, termed gp140s, are rendered soluble for vaccine development by deleting the transmembrane region of gp41 (ref.  7 ). However, doing so creates a loose end at the C terminus, which may destabilize inter-subunit interactions 2 , 3 , 4 . For most gp140s, the cleavage site between gp120 and the gp41 ectodomain is deliberately eliminated to 'stabilize' the trimer 7 . However, that stability is illusory, because these 'uncleaved' gp140s predominantly adopt configurations in which semi-dissociated gp120 subunits dangle loosely from the gp41 six-helical bundle 8 , 9 , 10 . The outcome is reminiscent of the conformational changes outlined above: the dissociation of gp120 from the gp41 ectodomain and the latter's transition to the six-helical bundle post-fusion conformation. These stability problems, and the resulting loss of epitopes that elicit broadly neutralizing antibodies, are overcome in the BG505 SOSIP.664 trimers through the introduction of an amino-acid substitution (I559P) 11  that prevents the loop-to-helix transition in segment B and of an engineered disulphide bond between cysteine residues 501 and 605 (ref.  12 ) that pins the gp120 subunits to the four-helix ring of gp41 ( Fig. 1 ). Cleavage of the trimers is also promoted, which seems to strengthen the association between gp120 and gp41 (ref.  9 ). Together, these engineered changes maintain the soluble trimers in the pre-fusion conformation and preserve key epitopes for eliciting neutralizing antibodies 2 , 3 , 4 , 6 . The BG505 SOSIP.664 trimers, which are now vaccine candidates for human trials, are encouragingly immunogenic in animals, provoking a strong and consistent neutralizing-antibody response to the BG505 virus, a neutralization-resistant strain of HIV-1. But they do not elicit broadly neutralizing antibodies. Future strategies to increase the breadth of the antibody response may involve reverse-engineering the immunogens on the basis of antibody evolution 13  and devising different ways of presenting them to the immune system, for example as particulate antigens 14 . Nowadays, structure-guided immunogen design is the best route to an effective vaccine 15 , and the new structural data will undoubtedly facilitate such improvements. By again placing their stamp on the envelope, the Kwong group has posted a frank warning to the virus. Correspondence to\n                 Rogier W. Sanders  or  John P. Moore .

See Letter    p.385 An enduring mystery in our effort to understand most human cancers is the identities of the cells from which they arise. Attempts to define these 'cells of origin' have often used markers that are expressed in advanced tumours as a reference point. However, because cancer cells have, by definition, undergone a transformation from a normal to a diseased state, this approach is fatally flawed. By analogy, passengers disembarking from an aeroplane wearing winter clothes might look as if they had boarded in a cold country, but they could equally be arriving in a wintry location having set off from somewhere warm. In this issue, Xu  et al . 1  ( page 385 ) take an alternative approach to the cell-of-origin problem, identifying the cell type that gives rise to retinoblastoma by studying normal cells in the human retina. Retinoblastoma is a childhood cancer of the retina that often serves as a model system for cancer studies. Indeed, work on this cancer led to the seminal discovery of the  RB1  gene 2 , which encodes the retinoblastoma tumour-suppressor protein RB. To investigate the cell of origin of retinoblastoma, Xu and colleagues manipulated human embryonic retinal cells, and found that precursor cells destined to become cone photoreceptors are unusually sensitive to the loss of  RB1 . The fact that cone precursors are differentiating cells committed to forming light-sensing retinal cells indicates that the cells of origin of human cancers do not necessarily have to be stem- or progenitor-cell types, as is often posited 3 , 4 . The authors purified human cones and showed that RB depletion in these cells, but not in other retinal populations, causes retinoblastoma when the cells are transplanted into recipient mice \u2014 a finding that resolves decades of debate 5  ( Fig. 1 ). These data are compelling, but live imaging of early tumours from patients' eyes shows that lesions occur in the 'inner nuclear layer' of the retina 6 . This is the middle of three strata that comprise the retina, but cones are located in the outermost layer. Retinoblastomas might grow from displaced cone precursors in the inner nuclear layer. Alternatively, it is conceivable that a lack of RB causes a cell in the inner nuclear layer to change its fate to become a cone or cone-like cell, because differentiating retinal cells are plastic. The susceptibility of purified cones to division and transformation following the loss of RB suggests that this idea is unlikely, although one should bear in mind that the cells used in these experiments have been dislodged from their normal milieu. There is also precedence for fate change in other cell lineages after RB loss 7 . What do the current results mean for mouse models of cancer? Mice are better protected from retinoblastoma than are humans \u2014 other tumour-suppressor genes must be deleted in genetically engineered mice in addition to the  Rb1  gene to cause the cancer to develop 8 , 9 . As in humans, RB loss causes abnormal division of differentiating mouse retinal cells, but whereas Xu and co-workers observed that only cones are significantly affected in the human retina, all neuronal cell types are perturbed in that of the mouse 8 , 9 . The cell of origin for mouse retinoblastoma is also a differentiating retinal neuron, although of the amacrine (interneuron) lineage rather than the cone lineage 8 . Amacrine and cone cells are generated in the retina at around the same developmental stage, and may thus share aspects of their gene-expression circuitry, especially early in their development. Indeed, the gene-expression patterns in human and mouse retinoblastoma are similar 10 , and there are also parallels in the genetic mutations that they harbour, such as deletions in the  CDKN2A  tumour-suppressor gene 11 . Furthermore, amacrine cells are located in the inner nuclear layer of the retina, where retinoblastoma emerges in humans. Thus, although there are differences in retinoblastomas between the two species, the numerous similarities make mouse models a valuable tool for future research and therapeutic testing. One central issue in retinoblastoma and many other familial cancers is the striking specificity of tumour development. Why do patients with mutations in  RB1  develop tumours specifically in the eye before the age of five, even though the gene is expressed everywhere? The answer may lie in this latest study, and in previous observations made by the same group 12 . It seems that the molecular circuitry that is present in cone precursor cells renders them uniquely sensitive to cancerous transformation when RB is lost. For instance, Xu  et al . found evidence to suggest that high levels of the ubiquitin ligase enzymes SKP2 and MDM2, and of the cancer-causing protein N-Myc, are crucial for cone precursors to begin proliferating without undergoing programmed cell death. Mouse amacrine cells seem to have similar circuits that sensitize them to the loss of RB, including the ability to resist cell death driven by the transcription factor E2F \u2014 a normal result of E2F expression following loss of RB function in mouse retinal cell types 13 . One interesting exception is the p107 protein, a relative of RB that has a tumour-suppressor role in mice 13  but which the current study indicates can promote the development of cancer in human cone precursors harbouring  RB1  mutations. In conclusion, Xu and colleagues' fantastic work solves a controversial issue and provides a proof of principle for similar studies in other solid tumours. Once again, retinoblastoma acts as a model for the cancer field. Knowledge of the cell of origin for retinoblastoma (and other cancers) may help researchers to develop approaches for better diagnosis, earlier detection, and possibly chemoprevention. In addition, a better understanding of the molecular circuitry that renders cells susceptible to cancerous transformation may help to uncover Achilles heels in tumour cells.

On page  543  of this issue, Helmus  et al . study human-assisted movement of lizards around Caribbean islands, and show that a major geographic parameter of a classic theory of biodiversity has been replaced by an economic one (M. R. Helmus, D. L. Mahler and J. B. Losos  Nature   513 , 543\u2013546; 2014). The theory of island biogeography predicts that biodiversity is greatest on large and less-isolated islands (or other discrete habitat fragments), but the underlying processes of speciation and long-distance colonization are usually too slow for the theory to be tested directly. The shipping trade has speeded things up for anole lizards in the Caribbean, transporting them around the islands as stowaways (pictured:  Anolis equestris ). The authors find that the resulting diversity of  Anolis  species fits theoretical predictions about island size, but that economic isolation \u2014 such as occurred on Cuba during the cold war \u2014 has overtaken geographic isolation as the other key factor.

It was admitted from the outset that there is no intrinsic merit in international research as such, since the important thing in any scientific work is the result, not how or where the work is carried out. The justification for any proposed international effort must therefore be carefully examined ... The experience of running CERN presented some interesting lessons ... CERN had been formed at a time when there was a sense of togetherness among most of the nations of Western Europe, a feeling which sought for some practical expression. It was important that any concrete form which could be given to it should not be controversial, should not be military, should not be a political disaster if it failed and that success if achieved should be clearly recognizable. If these factors were present, the way was open for the scientists, who, after all, led the world in international co-operation, to exert pressure on their political colleagues. \n               From  \n               Nature \n                1 August 1964 \n             \n               100 Years ago \n             Many instances are on record of so-called \u201cwolf-children,\u201d said to have been found in the jungles of India.

See Letter    p.376 That electrons have negative charge and repel each other are concepts familiar to most readers. Less well known is that they also possess a magnetic moment associated with their spin, and therefore exert magnetic forces on one another. However, interactions between individual electron spins have hitherto not been measured. This is mainly because they are dwarfed by other effects: for small, atomic-scale separation between electrons, the Pauli exclusion principle, which states that two electrons cannot occupy the same quantum state, and the Coulomb electric interaction dominate; and for large separation, the strength of the magnetic interaction is vastly reduced and typically fully masked by the force that an electron's magnetic moment experiences in an ambient fluctuating magnetic field. On  page 376  of this issue, Kotler  et al . 1  report how they have succeeded in detecting the minuscule magnetic interaction between two electrons bound to two ions separated by about 2 micrometres, using ideas from the emerging field of quantum sensing. The quantum states of single photons, atoms and ions, and of impurity ions in crystals, can be controlled almost perfectly in the laboratory. Initially, the development of experimental techniques to control and manipulate such quantum states was motivated by an interest in testing the fundamental principles of quantum physics. Nowadays, advances in quantum-state manipulation are also targeted towards applications such as quantum computing, quantum simulation and quantum sensing. Whereas quantum computing and simulation require exquisite control of interactions between large numbers of quantum particles, sensing applications, in which quantum systems serve as sensing devices, are much less demanding in that regard. In their study, Kotler  et al . control and manipulate the valence electrons of two strontium ions confined in an electrical device known as a Paul trap. To understand their work, think of the spin of a strontium ion's valence electron as a tiny magnet with a north and a south pole \u2014 like the needle of a magnetic compass \u2014 that aligns with external magnetic fields. But imagine what happens if two such compass needles are placed close to each other. Now, one needle may interact with the other and rotate slightly, depending on the orientation of the other needle. It is exactly this small effect \u2014 the magnetic interaction of two single spins \u2014 that Kotler and colleagues measured in their experiment. To perform their measurements, the researchers first used laser pulses to cool the ions and initialize them such that the magnetic moments of the valence electrons pointed in opposite directions. Returning to the magnetic-compass analogy, both south poles are now facing and repelling each other ( Fig. 1a ). In addition, the interactions of the two electrons with a uniform external magnetic field \u2014 which should be eliminated in order to measure the tiny spin\u2013spin interaction strength \u2014 are balanced out, because they are of the same magnitude but opposite sign. Next, the directions of both compass needles were rapidly and continuously flipped simultaneously ( Fig. 1b ). This step helped to compensate for fluctuations of the external magnetic field, which are different in strength at the two ion locations. On average, any interactions of the ions with the fluctuating external magnetic field essentially vanished, and Kotler and co-workers were set to measure the spin\u2013spin interaction strength. In the two configurations described above (south poles or north poles facing one another), the spin\u2013spin interaction causes the magnetic moments to repel each other and start turning ( Fig. 1c ). In the experiment, the magnetic moments turn but do so in a 'coherent quantum superposition'. This is a neat quantum trick, in which the electrons' magnetic moments are forced to align with each other and eventually become quantum entangled. By measuring the properties of this carefully designed state, which is immune to magnetic noise and has a lifetime of almost 1 minute, the authors could measure the rotation of the moments and thus the spin\u2013spin interaction strength. Owing to the extremely small strength of the interaction and associated rotation rate (only 0.0009 hertz), the authors had to wait 15 seconds before they could determine the rotation. Kotler and colleagues' study has broad ramifications for quantum sensing. The experimental sequence adopted by the authors may be readily applied to other atomic systems, as well as to molecular, optical and solid-state systems, with the prospect of using them as sensitive magnetic probes. The approach may be relevant for developing clocks based on trapped ions or atoms 2  and for sensing small interactions in hybrid systems, such as mixtures of cold ions and atoms 3 , 4 . Applying the technique to solid-state systems will be particularly interesting, because these systems offer prospects for commercial applications such as magnetic sensors operating in 'noisy' environments. Magnetic sensors based on single-nitrogen-atom impurities in diamond have already been produced 5 , 6  and are close to reaching the sensitivity needed to detect a single nuclear spin. Physicists await further advances in quantum sensing with great interest. Correspondence to\n                 Ferdinand Schmidt-Kaler . Reprints and Permissions"},

Although some troubadours serve up monotonous repetitions of stereotyped songs, most animals, including birds, mammals and insects, like to jazz things up by varying their song patterns. But how the brain generates such variability, and improvisation more generally, remains largely a mystery. On  page 233 , Coen  et al . 1  shed light on this issue by showing that much of the variability in the love songs of fruit flies can be predicted from the singers' movements. Neuroscientists' fascination with the sex life of the fruit fly  Drosophila melanogaster  began more than 35 years ago with the discovery of  fruitless , a gene essential for the male courtship ritual 2 . This unique handle on a complex social behaviour, in an organism amenable to genetic modification, paved the way for an exceedingly detailed anatomical mapping of the underlying neural circuitry 3 , 4 . Deciphering the details of what these circuits do and determining what they can teach us about brain function more broadly are major challenges that would be greatly helped by having a comprehensive description of the computations that the circuits perform and the behaviours they implement. One thing that we know these circuits do is transform their male owners into mini Casanovas. On encountering a receptive virgin female, a male fly will gently tap her rear end, serenade her with a 'song' by vibrating one of his wings, and lick her genitalia 5 . Although these behaviours are part of any self-respecting fly's lovemaking repertoire, the duration and ordering of the different courtship elements can be highly unpredictable. What gives rise to such seemingly random behaviour? Is the variability due to stochastic fluctuations in the underlying neural networks (neural noise) 6 , 7 , or the result of a dynamic sensory experience? To address these questions, Coen and colleagues focused on the male fly's song, itself a variable sequence of distinct elements 1 , 8 . Just as the Beatles made a career of mixing 'love', 'you', 'me', 'she' and 'baby' in different ways, so male fruit flies switch between 'sine' and 'pulse' songs to impress their audience ( Fig. 1 ). By eavesdropping on more than 100,000 love songs while carefully monitoring the whereabouts of the courting couple, the authors suggest that a logic and order exist in the apparent musical randomness. Coen  et al . performed a statistical analysis of their high-resolution behavioural data, and found that transitions between sine and pulse songs can be predicted from the courted female's movements. The authors further discovered that the male's visual experience of the female shapes his song through neural circuits that control locomotion. In fact, the best predictor of song structure is not the female's movements, but the singer's own. Even blind flies, who are induced to sing by the scent of virgin females, show a bias in their song transitions that can be predicted from their movements. The picture that emerges from all of this is one in which the male fly executes a tightly integrated song-and-dance number, inspired by (if he can see her) his partner's movements. As impressive as that may be, the extent to which the female cares about the details of her lover's intricate performance remains unclear. Does she use information embedded in his song pattern to determine his desirability? Does his ability to couple changes in his song to body movements \u2014 his or hers \u2014 correlate with other qualities that she would want in a mate? In other words, is song patterning an example of a carefully tuned signalling system, or does it reflect a coupling between leg and wing movements that evolved for unrelated reasons? Initial experiments to address these questions have failed to provide clear answers. Coen  et al . show that song transitions are similar whether or not the singer is ultimately successful in mating. Yet pheromone-insensitive males, who sing for normal durations but have altered song patterning 8 , tend to be slower and less successful in convincing females to mate 1 , 8 . Whether these flies are handicapped in the courting game because of a defect in how they vary their songs, or because of unrelated effects, remains to be seen. But whether song patterning matters to females or not, we now know that its variability, and probably the variability of many other 'fixed' behaviours, is not simply the consequence of noise in nervous-system function 6 , 7 . Rather, a sizeable fraction of that variability is likely to reflect computations performed by reliable and predictable brains on an ever-changing sensory environment. Importantly, this insight was made possible by simultaneously observing, at high temporal resolution, the sensory environment and behavioural output of a genetically tractable organism during a complex social interaction. Such detailed analysis applied to natural behaviours has the power, as Coen  et al . aptly demonstrate, to distil seemingly complex and unpredictable behavioural patterns into simple rules and sensorimotor transformations 9 , 10 . With such an approach, rather than being the fog that prevents us from understanding nervous-system function, behavioural variability and complexity can be the searchlight that helps us to identify the computational problems that brains evolved to solve.

This treatment generates a new cell population that contributes to both the embryo and the placenta.  See Article    p.641  &  Letter    p.676 Cell specialization in mammals is essential for diverse functions, such as muscle contraction and nerve conduction. These specializations become fixed during development, and conversion between differentiated cell types seems to be extremely rare. However, in this issue, two studies by Obokata  et al . 1 , 2  show that cells isolated from newborn mice lose their identity on exposure to mildly acidic conditions. Remarkably, instead of triggering cell death or tumour growth, as might be expected, a new cell state emerges that exhibits an unprecedented potential for differentiation into every possible cell type. Studies on tissue regeneration in amphibians, reptiles and birds indicate that differentiated cells have some ability to dedifferentiate or to switch identity. Mammalian cells are more resistant, but fate conversion is observed in certain cancers. It was only with the cloning of Dolly the sheep 3 , in which nuclear material from the mammary cell of an adult sheep was transferred into an enucleated egg cell to produce a cloned animal, that the capacity for complete reprogramming of the mammalian genome was confirmed. However, cloning does not convert whole cells. Whole cells can be induced to switch identity by genetic manipulation. The introduction of certain transcription factors can in specific contexts rewire gene circuitry, leading to changes in cell specialization 4 . In 2006, the cell-identity and cloning research paths were unified through the discovery of a phenomenon known as induced pluripotency 5 : when mouse fibroblast cells were treated with a quartet of embryonic regulatory factors, a small percentage adopted the molecular and functional attributes of embryonic stem cells. The resulting induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) had the dual abilities to self-renew indefinitely and to differentiate into all somatic cell types ( Fig. 1a ). Subsequently, iPSCs have been produced from a range of adult cell types, fostering enthusiasm worldwide for developing customized disease-modelling and cell-therapy applications. What, then, is the significance of the two reports by Obokata and colleagues? The authors were inspired by the notion that physical stimuli might be sufficient to change a cell's identity. An example from nature is temperature-dependent sex determination in crocodile embryos 6 . And in the laboratory, frog cells fated to form skin will develop into brain tissue 7  if exposed to a solution of low pH. These changes in fate occur in embryonic progenitor cells. In their first report ( page 641 ), Obokata and co-workers 1  investigated the effect of physical stimuli on cells from newborn mice. In a similar manner to that used in iPSC reprogramming studies 5 , the researchers monitored cells using a 'reporter' protein that fluoresces when a gene associated with pluripotency is turned on. They applied various stresses to white blood cells and found that, after a short exposure to a solution of low pH, the cells lost markers of blood identity, and a proportion activated the pluripotency reporter. The authors collected cells marked with the reporter and found that the cells had gene markers typical of early embryos. They describe this phenomenon as stimulus-triggered acquisition of pluripotency (STAP). When injected into embryos, cells generated by STAP ('STAP cells') produced chimaeras \u2014 mice composed of cells originating from both the host embryo and the STAP cells. The ability to produce chimaeras is a property that was previously thought to be exclusive to embryonic stem cells and iPSCs. STAP cells differ from both of these cell types, however, in that they have little or no capacity for self-renewal and can be maintained for only a few days. The authors investigated this discrepancy and discovered that, if STAP cells are transferred into the culture conditions used to grow pluripotent stem cells, they begin to proliferate, and acquire structural features and gene markers diagnostic of embryonic stem cells. The researchers termed these self-renewing cells STAP stem cells ( Fig. 1b ). The STAP-cell state might therefore be similar to the incompletely reprogrammed intermediate cells observed during iPSC formation 8 . However, as documented in Obokata and colleagues' second report 2  ( page 676 ), a further surprise was in store. Examination of chimaeras produced from STAP cells revealed that the cells colonized extraembryonic layers such as the trophoblast, a structure that gives rise to the placenta, in addition to the embryo body. This colonization is rarely seen in chimaeras produced from embryonic stem cells or iPSCs, and it implies that cells generated by STAP have an unusually broad developmental potency. The authors then tested culture conditions normally used to obtain trophoblast stem cells. STAP cells again proliferated, but now acquired a trophoblast-like identity, confirming their broad potency ( Fig. 1b ). The STAP state may represent a developmental stage that precedes segregation of extraembryonic and embryonic cell lineages. However, it is not evident that embryos ever contain single cells that have the complement of markers and behaviours exhibited by STAP cells. An alternative explanation could be that STAP cells constitute a mixture of cells predisposed to extraembryonic or embryonic differentiation. More provocatively, STAP cells might be an indeterminate, synthetic cell type \u2014 a blank slate \u2014 from which extraembryonic or embryonic gene circuitries emerge in appropriate environments. The unexpected finding that a physical stimulus can trigger dedifferentiation of cells to a state of unrestricted potency opens up the possibility of obtaining patient-specific stem cells by a simple procedure, without genetic manipulation. STAP cells have yet to be produced from humans, however. Obokata and colleagues 1  provided evidence of reproducible STAP-cell generation from different mouse tissues, but they did not test other species. Furthermore, they used immature cells as a starting material, and it remains to be seen whether adult cells will respond similarly. Nonetheless, they have established a new principle: that a physical stimulus can be sufficient to dismember gene-control circuitry and create a 'plastic' state from which a previously unattainable level of potency can rapidly develop. How pluripotent circuitry self-organizes, and how the body suppresses this, are fascinating questions. Notably, provision of leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF), a cell-signalling molecule, promotes the emergence of STAP cells. This is tantalizing because LIF is the self-renewal factor for embryonic stem cells, has a crucial role in the formation of iPSCs 9 , 10  and drives the conversion of germ cells to pluripotent cells 11 .

See Article    p.421 A paper 1  published  this week in  Nature  marks the culmination of a long debate about the genetic basis of a disorder sometimes considered psychiatry's heartland 2  \u2014 schizophrenia. No other psychiatric condition has evoked such diverse opinions. Its biological roots have often been denied and, in the anti-psychiatry movement of the 1970s, there was even outright rejection of its existence. The latest paper, from the Schizophrenia Working Group of the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium, reports an analysis of more than 150,000 people and finds more than 100 genetic regions associated with schizophrenia, laying to rest forever the idea that genetics is not an important cause of the illness. Dispute over schizophrenia's genetic basis has been ferocious. This is hardly surprising given that Swiss psychiatrist Ernst R\u00fcdin \u2014 an early proponent of the argument that the condition is a single-gene disorder \u2014 advocated the view that people with mental illnesses should not have children 3 , and justified the sterilization and murder of people with schizophrenia. Despite the disease's long and contentious history, by the end of the twentieth century there was consensus that genetic factors were involved 4 . But agreeing that genetics has a part to play is not the same as finding individual genetic regions (loci) that contribute to disease susceptibility. Progress in this arena has been marked by false starts 5 , 6 , and by more than 800 genetic associations 7  of dubious value. Not unreasonably, many would ask why we should be any more confident that the consortium's geneticists have now got it right. The short answer is that the tests for associations between each gene in the human genome and disease are now mature. The correct criteria for determining significance in these tests are as familiar to human geneticists as their two-times table, and are exhaustively documented in the consortium's paper. Since the first genome-wide analyses for schizophrenia emerged in 2009 (refs  8 ,  9 ), the size of the studies has increased, as have the numbers of loci associated with the condition ( Fig. 1 ). The Psychiatric Genomics Consortium has now confirmed the existence of 108 loci that contribute to disease susceptibility. But even this number is insufficient to entirely explain the genetic causes of schizophrenia. So what does this discovery mean? First and foremost, it confirms that genetics is a major cause of the illness. The risk variants now identified are common \u2014 they contribute in most, if not all, cases. This is a tremendous advance, of the sort that rewrites textbooks. Given the turbulent history of the field, this is a point that deserves emphasis and should be cause for well-earned celebration among those who carried out the work. Second, we now know something about the probable genes involved. Readers not familiar with the vagaries of genome-wide association studies need to be aware that there is a difference between finding a genetic locus and finding a gene. Usually, it is assumed that the relevant gene is the one that lies nearest to the identified locus, but, as recently reported 10  for a locus involved in obesity, this is not necessarily the case. As a rule of thumb, however, the closest gene is probably a good place to start. So what genes are involved? Expectant readers will have to turn to Table 3 of the Supplementary Information ( go.nature.com/koxm8i ) to find all the details. Those who take the trouble will be rewarded with some delightful insights. For many years, a leading hypothesis has been that schizophrenia arises from abnormal neuronal signalling involving dopamine. This theory was based on evidence 11  indicating that the efficacy of antipsychotic drugs correlates with their ability to block dopamine receptors. It turns out that those who championed the involvement of dopamine-related genes were right (a dopamine-receptor gene,  DRD2 , is associated). However, by no means all dopamine-related genes are involved (the gene encoding catechol- O -methyltransferase, an enzyme that metabolizes released dopamine, is not associated). Having climbed a mountain of genetic analyses, it is perhaps a shame that the authors do not offer much of a view from the peak \u2014 no new biological hypotheses are presented. But it is clear that the idea that schizophrenia is merely a disorder of neuronal signalling (either dopamine- or glutamate-related) stands in need of revision. By far the most significant association is a locus on chromosome 6 that includes a region containing genes involved in acquired immunity: the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). Given that the MHC also contains genes encoding various functional activities, the fact that the most significant association lies in the MHC is only suggestive of its role. However, Figure 2 in the paper contains another intriguing observation. The genetic effects in schizophrenia are enriched in regions outside the MHC that are also involved in acquired immunity. Is schizophrenia in part a disorder of acquired immunity? Surely this idea should start to be taken seriously. It is perhaps ironic that one of the earliest genetic associations reported 12  was with the MHC. It is possible that environmental exposure explains some of the genetic associations documented in this report. For instance, DNA-sequence variations in the  CHRNA5-A3-B4  gene cluster are strongly associated with heavy smoking 13 . Smoking is extremely common (more than 80% prevalence) in people with schizophrenia 14 , and the consortium's identification of an associated variant in the  CHRNA5-A3-B4  gene cluster might reflect a dose\u2013response relationship between heaviness of smoking and schizophrenia risk, instead of \u2014 or as well as \u2014 a direct relationship. As ever-larger genome-wide association studies are conducted, we will presumably begin to pick up indirect effects. In other words, such studies may tell us about the environmental as well as the genetic causes of the disease. Correspondence to\n                 Jonathan Flint . Reprints and Permissions"},
