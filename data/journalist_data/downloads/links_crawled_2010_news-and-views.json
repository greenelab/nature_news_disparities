This is exactly what Kodera  et al . have achieved in a remarkable study that appears elsewhere in this issue (N. Kodera, D. Yamamoto, R. Ishikawa and T. Ando  Nature   468 , 72\u201376; 2010). They have been able to directly visualize myosin V, a cytoskeletal motor protein, as it 'walks' along actin filaments. The authors have developed a high-speed atomic force microscopy (HS-AFM) method that enables them to generate rapid images of proteins at much higher resolution than light microscopy. Here they apply this technological advance to visualize the stepwise movement of myosin V. The protein consists of two heads connected by long necks (lever arms) to a globular tail domain through a coiled-coil helix. The tail binds to various cargo molecules to transport them along the actin filaments, the energy required being generated by hydrolysis of ATP to ADP. The HS-AFM images showing the leading (L) and trailing (T) heads of the tail-truncated motor can be seen in Figure 1a of the paper on page 73, part of which is reproduced here. In frame 1, myosin is advancing from the left; in frames 2 and 3, it has marched into full view, the two heads and necks now being visible; in frame 4, it has moved on a step. See  http://go.nature.com/DHBOY9  for the full movie. The authors' analysis confirms the known behaviour of myosin motors, including the use of successive 36-nanometre steps along the actin filament and the 'hand-over-hand' movement of the motor heads. However, the study also provides convincing evidence for the hypothesized 'lever-arm swing'. In this feature, tiny changes in myosin's head domain are amplified by the lever arm to produce large displacements at the far end of the neck that translate into movement of the whole protein along the actin filaments. The new analysis also uncovers novel characteristics of the myosin V mechanism, such as a 'stomping' behaviour, in which either the L or T head becomes detached then rebinds to actin. The stomp is observed more frequently for the L than for the T head, but the T-head stomp often leads to a forward movement on the actin filament. The insight into the behaviour of myosin V that Kodera  et al . reveal will have a major impact on understanding the mechanisms involved in biological molecular motors. More generally, the technological advance provided by HS-AFM looks set to take a prominent place in the field of biomolecular imaging. Reprints and Permissions"},

Not so, report Greif and Siemers in  Nature Communications . They have found that bats identify any extended, echo-acoustically smooth surface as water, and will try to drink from it ( S. Greif and B. M. Siemers  Nature Commun.  doi:10.1038/ncomms1110; 2010 ). The way in which bats locate point objects has been studied extensively, but how they recognize extended objects, such as pools of water, isn't known. As pictured here, bats drink while on the wing. Greif and Siemers hypothesized that, when searching for a drink, the animals look for the echo-reflection signature of water surfaces \u2014 the only extended, acoustically smooth surfaces in a bat's environment.  When a bat sends an echolocation beam at a glancing angle to a water surface, most of the beam bounces off the surface away from the animal, like light off a mirror. But a small part of the beam travels vertically down from its source, and is reflected right back to the bat. This reflection pattern could act as a flag for water. To test this idea, the authors conducted experiments on 15 species of wild bat, placing them in a room that had two large plates on the floor. The plates were made of one of several materials: wood, metal or plastic. Each of the surfaces was either smooth or textured. The smooth surfaces reflect echolocation beams in the same way as water, and, sure enough, thirsty bats repeatedly tried to drink from these surfaces, but ignored the textured ones (see movie at  http://go.nature.com/pnpal8 ). The authors thus concluded that bats use echolocation to recognize bodies of water. When Greif and Siemers trialled juvenile bats that had had no previous contact with ponds, the animals also tried to drink from the smooth plates, thus revealing the water-location mechanism to be innate. What's more, the authors found that echolocation overrides conflicting sensory stimuli such as vision, chemoreception and touch.

Welcome to the third phase of human genomics.  See Article    p.1061 The goal of the 1000 Genomes Project 1  is to find most of the variants in the human genome that have a frequency of at least 1% in the populations studied. The consortium of researchers participating in the project now reports the results of its pilot phase ( page 1061  of this issue 2 ). But first let's take a step back. A decade ago, the reference copy of the human genome was sequenced 3 , 4 . Although that project is undoubtedly one of the greatest scientific achievements of our time, its potential societal impact will be fully realized only if genomic regions that are responsible for various traits of medical importance, such as response to a drug or susceptibility to a disease, can be identified. After the initial sequencing of the human genome, therefore, a second phase of human genomics emerged, focusing on identifying genomic variations responsible for hereditary diseases and other medically relevant traits. Such genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are based on examining the genomes of thousands of individuals for correlations between the presence of genomic variants and the trait of interest. Many successes have come out of GWAS 5 , 6 , but there has also been some disappointment that perhaps the pickings from these studies have been too slim 7 . For instance, although certain disorders \u2014 including obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular disease \u2014 are known to have a strong genetic component, their associated genomic variants detected through GWAS cannot explain most of the experimentally identified genetic effects found in affected families. Human geneticists call this problem the 'missing heritability' 7 . There are many possible explanations for the missing heritability, the most popular being the effect of rare variants. GWAS are based on examining a battery of different variants across the genome. Until recently, however, the cost of including both common and rare variants in such studies was prohibitively high, pushing the focus towards identifying common variants that occur at a relatively high frequency in the population. Consequently, if many rare variants, rather than a few common ones, are responsible for a disease, the rare variants would have been missed in most GWAS. An obvious solution to this problem is to sequence whole genomes. But this is easier said than done: GWAS require sample sizes of thousands, making whole-genome sequencing extremely expensive. However, computational-biology studies have provided crucial insight that is helping to pave the way for more-comprehensive genomic studies. The idea is that if most of both common and rare variants can be characterized in just a few individuals through whole-genome sequencing, a relatively small battery of variants could then be identified in the remaining individuals in the genome-wide association study, and the pattern of those variants could be inferred computationally on the basis of the few whole-genome sequences. Sceptics may find this notion \u2014 using the data from some individuals to 'invent' data for others \u2014 alarming. But if done correctly, this method, called imputation 8 , can significantly increase the statistical power of GWAS ( Fig. 1 ). This idea is one of the main motivating forces behind the 1000 Genomes Project. In the pilot phase of the project 2 , the authors used several techniques to sequence the whole genomes of 179 individuals. They thereby generated a catalogue of 8 million previously unknown variants affecting single nucleotides \u2014 the building blocks of genes \u2014 and around 1 million structural variants due to small insertions or deletions of DNA. The study also presents several new methods for analysing genomic data. For example, it convincingly shows that imputation methods can significantly increase the power of GWAS. New technologies also allow the protein-coding sequences (exons) within genes to be sequenced specifically. The vast majority of genomic DNA falls outside genes, but many of the most important variants are thought to be located within exons. Exon sequencing therefore provides a cost-effective method for identifying most of the functional variants. The consortium 2  reports exon sequences of 697 individuals from different ethnic groups. Apart from exon sequencing, another way to contain the cost of sequencing based on GWAS is to sequence genomes at only low coverage. This means that, for each individual, only a limited amount of randomly distributed DNA is sequenced. Although, on average, a genome is sequenced several times using this technique, there may be missing data in any particular genomic region. In fact, low coverage was the approach taken for whole-genome sequencing of the 179 individuals 2 . A disadvantage of low-coverage sequencing is a higher error rate; but this can be reduced, again using imputation methods. Indeed, the consortium's low-coverage data produced an overall error rate of only 1\u20133% thanks to supplementation with such methods. Imputation-based methods may therefore also be the key to maximizing the utility of low-coverage sequencing data. Characterizing variants in heterozygous sites, which contain two versions of the DNA, is more difficult, and for them the error rate in the present study varied between 5% and 30% depending on the frequency of the variant. Given the declining cost of DNA sequencing, future discoveries in human genomics are more likely to be based on a combination of exon sequencing and low-coverage, whole-genome sequencing, rather than on the more traditional techniques. Such DNA sequencing gives access to rare and novel variants, as well as being more suitable for identifying DNA insertions and deletions and, in general, for detecting less-common variants that affect only a single nucleotide. The remaining question is how to accommodate errors in low-coverage sequencing, because an error rate of even a few per cent can lead to drastically reduced power if not accounted for appropriately 9 . Statistical methods that incorporate high error rates will be an essential component of future genomic-sequencing efforts. But no matter which protocol is used, the focus of the third phase of human genomics will clearly be on whole-genome sequencing. Reprints and Permissions"},

But although an estimated 80% of the variability in height is thought to be down to genetic factors, pinpointing which genes are the main drivers is a challenge. Researchers of the GIANT Consortium now report the most comprehensive analysis yet of genomic factors that affect human height ( H. Lango Allen  et al .  Nature  doi:10.1038/nature09410; 2010 ). Unlike features such as the ABO blood group, which are probably determined by single genes, height is a complex trait resulting from the cumulative \u2014 but individually small \u2014 contribution of many genes. So identifying small-effect genes requires studies with large sample sizes. Lango Allen  et al . performed a meta-analysis of data from other genome-wide association (GWA) studies, investigating variations in height in nearly 185,000 adults. Their paper, however, is notable not just for being one of the largest GWA studies to date, but also for identifying the largest number (180) of genomic loci associated with a single trait. GWA studies are often criticized for providing data of little immediate significance. So what else can be deduced from the authors' findings? The 180 shortlisted loci are enriched in genes implicated in abnormal skeletal growth; such genes most often lie nearest to a height-associated variant. What's more, for five loci, height-linked variants correlated strongly with variants associated with traits and disorders such as bone mineral density, rheumatoid arthritis and obesity. One possibility is that the latter variants affect height indirectly. The authors argue, therefore, that one benefit of GWA studies is that they highlight genes deserving of further study.  But there is at least one more step to go. Variants at an estimated 517 other loci may make similar or greater contributions and, together with Lango Allen and colleagues' 180 loci, would account for some 20% of height heritability. To identify these additional loci, around 500,000 individuals must be sampled. Reprints and Permissions"},

The two arms of the loop show a difference of consistency; the contracted or ectoplasmic arm is more rigid.

In his 1961 book  The Theory of Fundamental Processes , Richard Feynman vividly described the satisfaction that he and Murray Gell-Mann felt at finding an explanation for the close similarity between the Fermi constants describing the \u03b2 decays of neutrons and muons. Feynman and Gell-Mann had discovered the 'universality' of weak interactions. This is similar to the universality of electromagnetic interactions and thus provided a tantalizing hint of a common origin for the two forces. But the book also recorded Feynman's disquiet that the Fermi constant of 'strange' particles (nuclear particles such as the lambda, comprising an up, a down and a strange quark) turned out to be smaller by a factor of 4 to 5. It was Nicola Cabibbo who reconciled these strange-particle decays with the universality of weak interactions. In doing so, he paved the way to the modern unified theory of the electromagnetic and weak forces that is central to the standard model of particle physics. Cabibbo died in Rome on 16 August following a severe respiratory illness. The son of a Sicilian lawyer, he was born in the same city on 10 April 1935. He graduated in theoretical physics at the Sapienza University of Rome under the supervision of Bruno Touschek, whom he would always consider his mentor. In the early 1960s, in Frascati just outside Rome, Touschek and his collaborators were building the first collider of electrons and their antiparticles, positrons. With Raoul Gatto, who was also to become a leading figure in particle theory, the young Cabibbo wrote an exploratory paper on the physics that could be studied using electron\u2013positron collisions, a paper that soon became a standard reference in the field. In 1962, while working at CERN, Europe's particle-physics laboratory near Geneva, Switzerland, Cabibbo found the solution to the puzzle of the weak decays of strange particles. Formulating what came to be known as Cabibbo universality, he assumed that all \u03b2 decays, whether they involved strange particles or not, had to be described in terms of a weak current that was determined by a single parameter \u2014 the Cabibbo angle. Using this angle, now determined to be about 12\u00b0, and exploiting the particle symmetries that had been discovered by Gell-Mann and Yuval Ne'eman, Cabibbo could not only explain the \u03b2 decays of strange particles, but could also account for the small discrepancy between the Fermi constants of neutron and muon \u03b2 decays. Cabibbo later reformulated the weak-interaction universality in terms of quarks \u2014 the elementary particles that constitute hadronic particles such as protons, neutrons and lambdas. Only three types of quark (up, down and strange) were then known, and Cabibbo showed that \u03b2 decays could be explained by a coupling between the types of quark encoded in the Cabibbo angle. (Put more technically, the weak interaction couples the up quark to an orthogonal combination of the down and strange quarks, determined by the Cabibbo angle.) This concept of the mixing of the different types of quark had major implications for particle physics, and in 1970, Sheldon Glashow, John Iliopoulos and I extended it to include a fourth type of quark, charm, whose existence was confirmed experimentally in 1974. Cabibbo universality and the charm quark made it possible to extend the unified electroweak theory, which had been proposed by Steve Weinberg and Abdus Salam, to the interactions of hadrons, ironing out the difficulties that had plagued the three-quark scheme. But the phenomenon of CP violation, observed in the decay of certain elementary particles, also had to be included. To account for it, Makoto Kobayashi and Toshihide Maskawa extended the theory further, introducing two more quarks, the bottom and top. In this six-quark model, Cabibbo's quark-mixing scheme is embedded in what is known as the Cabibbo\u2013Kobayashi\u2013Maskawa matrix. The success of Cabibbo's theory \u2014 now supported by decades of data, including the most recent data from CERN and Fermilab in Batavia, Illinois \u2014 and his exceptional talent as a teacher and conference speaker made Cabibbo an internationally known and influential figure. In 1966, he returned from CERN to Italy, where he taught theoretical physics at the universities of L'Aquila and Sapienza, moving in 1981 to the University of Rome Tor Vergata and returning to Sapienza in 1993. In Rome, he created a school of outstanding young particle physicists. Inspired by Cabibbo's intuition for physics, mathematical skill and personal charisma, the Rome school contributed significantly to establishing what is today known as the standard theory of particle physics \u2014 an elaborate framework describing the weak, the strong and the electromagnetic interactions. Among Cabibbo's many achievements are describing electron\u2013positron annihilation into hadrons in terms of point-like entities termed partons; calculation of the contribution of the combined electromagnetic and weak interactions to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon; and the prediction of a phase transition of nuclear matter to a plasma of quarks and gluons in quantum chromodynamics (QCD) \u2014 the particle-physics theory that today describes strong interactions. With Giorgio Parisi, Cabibbo proposed and built a parallel supercomputer, termed the array processor experiment (APE), for calculations in QCD. APE and its subsequent evolutions have proved useful in elucidating basic QCD phenomena in a regime where the usual mathematical approach of perturbation theory cannot be applied. From 1983 to 1992, Cabibbo served as president of the National Institute of Nuclear Physics in Frascati, making the transition (unexpected to most) to science administration. He was president of the Italian energy agency ENEA from 1993 to 1998, and from 1993 was president of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences, based in the Vatican. He brought to these positions vision, managerial skill and a universally appreciated integrity. In 1991, he became one of the first recipients of the European Physical Society's prize in high-energy and particle physics. He was awarded the American Physical Society's Sakurai prize in 1989 and the Dirac medal in 2010. Nicola liked teaching, and was still doing so until the last months of his life. Like all great thinkers, he could find simple ways to explain the most difficult concepts. His students were captivated by his simplicity, gentleness and sense of humour. So were all of us who had the privilege to be his collaborators and friends. Reprints and Permissions"},

A regulator of the elusive mitochondrial calcium channel has now been identified. Various stimuli generate signalling by calcium ions, a mechanism that has wide-ranging roles in biology, triggering secretion, contraction and differentiation, among other processes. Many of these processes are energy-intensive, necessitating increased production of the energy molecule ATP by cellular organelles called mitochondria. Thus, when cytoplasmic calcium signals are generated, calcium ions also enter mitochondria, where they enhance the activity of many metabolic enzymes and thereby increase ATP production 1 , 2 . But how does Ca 2+  enter mitochondria? Reporting on  page 291  of this issue, Perocchi  et al . 3  describe a protein that acts as a gatekeeper for the channel that transports Ca 2+  into mitochondria \u2014 the first regulator of this channel to be identified. The regulation of cytoplasmic and mitochondrial Ca 2+  levels is tightly linked. Increased cytoplasmic levels of Ca 2+  stimulate rapid uptake of the ion by mitochondria, and oscillations in Ca 2+  levels in mitochondria can be observed in response to those in the cytoplasm 1 . When cytoplasmic Ca 2+  levels are particularly high, mitochondria can act as a Ca 2+  buffer, taking up and storing large amounts of the ion. Mitochondria thus modulate the dynamics of cytoplasmic Ca 2+  signals and protect cells from Ca 2+  overload, while simultaneously promoting longer-term increases in their own metabolic activity. In addition, excessive Ca 2+  uptake by mitochondria activates pathways that lead to programmed cell death. The delivery of cytoplasmic Ca 2+  into mitochondria presents a special challenge. Unlike Ca 2+  channels such as the IP 3  receptor in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) \u2014 a cellular organelle that releases this ion into the cytoplasm \u2014 the mitochondrial uptake system works in the opposite direction, against the Ca 2+  concentration gradient. Years of work have revealed that Ca 2+  influx into mitochondria is driven by the presence of a strong negative electrical potential across the mitochondrial inner membrane, rather than by ATP-dependent pumping (which is used to transport Ca 2+  from the cytoplasm into the ER). Moreover, various studies have shown that cells have physical junctions, created by connector proteins, that hold the ER and mitochondrial membranes in close proximity, being separated by only 10\u201330 nanometres of aqueous space. At these junctions, local Ca 2+  concentrations may reach much higher levels than elsewhere, allowing mitochondria to directly take up Ca 2+  ions released from the ER 4  ( Fig. 1 ). This unique mitochondrial Ca 2+ -uptake channel has been termed the uniporter. It is located in the inner mitochondrial membrane \u2014 the outer membrane is freely permeable to Ca 2+ . The uniporter is highly sensitive to Ca 2+  concentrations, which suggests that not only is this ion transported through the channel, but it also functions as a regulator that can strongly increase the channel's activity. Once the ER is no longer releasing Ca 2+  and cytoplasmic Ca 2+  levels are again low, Ca 2+  is moved out of the mitochondria and back into the cytoplasm by a Na + /Ca 2+  exchanger (NLCX) 5  in the membrane, and possibly by an ion-exchange mechanism mediated by a Ca 2+ /H +  exchanger (LETM1) 6 . The molecular identities of most Ca 2+  regulatory proteins are known, but the mitochondrial Ca 2+  uniporter has remained an enigma. To identify the uniporter and its immediate regulators, Perocchi  et al . 3  performed a highly focused genetic screen, considering only candidate genes that met three criteria. First, the authors obtained their shortlist of candidates by using a catalogue of mitochondrial proteins that they had produced earlier 7  and selecting proteins of the inner mitochondrial membrane \u2014 the site of the uniporter's action. Second, they made use of evolutionary knowledge. Research in diverse organisms has established that uniporter activity is present in vertebrates and in a highly divergent branch of protozoa known as kinetoplastids, but is absent from the mitochondria of the yeast  Saccharomyces cerevisiae . Perocchi and colleagues therefore focused on genes encoding mitochondrial proteins that are present in vertebrates and kinetoplastids, but not in yeast. Finally, they considered only genes that are broadly expressed across mammalian cell types. Combined use of these filters left just 13 candidate genes. From RNA interference experiments performed to identify genes necessary for Ca 2+  uptake, Perocchi  et al . singled out the gene encoding a protein that they name MICU1 (for mitochondrial Ca 2+  uptake 1). The authors find that MICU1 triggers Ca 2+  influx into mitochondria when the ion binds to two sites, known as EF hands. These EF hands provide an appealing explanation for the strong regulation of the uniporter by Ca 2+ . Although MICU1 could in principle be the uniporter itself, a sequence analysis shows that it probably has only one transmembrane region. As ion channels typically contain many such regions, MICU1 is more likely to be the Ca 2+  sensor that regulates uniporter activity. If proven correct, Perocchi and co-workers' identification of the Ca 2+  sensor is a significant advance, because it provides a path to identifying the uniporter channel itself, as well as being a starting point for mechanistic studies. For example, how do the EF hands of MICU1 'gate' the activity of the channel? Also, previous work suggests that the Ca 2+  sensing responsible for mitochondrial Ca 2+  uptake occurs at the ER\u2013mitochondrion junctions, and so the present study offers experimental possibilities for studying Ca 2+  signalling at these junctions. Perocchi and colleagues' work provides a compelling example of the power of comparative genomics. With the number of sequenced genomes of various organisms steadily increasing, and a wealth of data available on the phenotypic properties of different organisms, similar strategies may provide an effective route to discovering the missing molecular components of crucial cellular processes.

Nature Chem.  doi:10.1038/nchem.827; 2010 ). They find that, under certain circumstances, complexes form that can act as precursors to glycine, the simplest amino acid. The idea that comets delivered organic molecules to the early Earth is disputed, because the extreme heat generated by the impact would probably have incinerated such a cargo. An alternative theory is that the heat and pressure of cometary impacts could have caused material on Earth's surface to react to form organic compounds. But the early Earth's chemical environment isn't thought to have been conducive to such reactions. Impacts in which Earth was struck glancingly, however, would have generated much lower temperatures within cometary ice, allowing organic matter to survive. Goldman  et al . therefore used quantum molecular dynamics to simulate events inside cometary ice during such collisions. The authors modelled a mixture of water, methanol, ammonia, carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide under conditions of shock compression, and found that many products were formed \u2014 including oligomers that contained the carbon\u2013nitrogen bonds required for amino acids. Subsequent quenching of the model system to lower pressures and temperatures broke the complexes into smaller fragments, including a glycine\u2013CO 2  complex.

Much research has been devoted to this problem in recent years, and it has been attacked from various points of view\u2014geological, historical, philological, botanical, etc. As the outcome of these investigations it would seem that everything now points to the conclusion that the broads resulted from peat digging in the Middle Ages. Somewhere about the fourteenth century slight land sinkage, perhaps combined with a tidal break-through such as occurred a few years ago, flooded the peat workings, and this flood water could not drain away owing to the new lower level of the land relative to the sea... So whether the holiday maker is sailing over aristocratic Ranworth or stately Barton or proletarian Wroxham, let him spare a moment to remember the old peat workers, his forerunners, to whose labours his present enjoyment is due. From  Nature  20 August 1960. \n               100 Years Ago \n             In the year ending 1910, May 10, the average daily number of chronometers and watches being rated (at Greenwich) was 596 ... The average number of chronometers rated daily has, we learn, more than trebled since 1880, so that the burden of this work borne by the Observatory has enormously increased. The work is doubtless most valuable for the Navy, but is our great national Observatory exactly the place where it should be done?... In the present day, with the increase of speed, a ship is seldom isolated for any great length of time, and the breakdown of a single chronometer is unlikely to be a serious matter. Thus the case for a long trial does not seem so strong as it may have been a generation ago. Very probably ere long the development of wireless telegraphy may alter the whole situation.

Whittington, who died on 20 June aged 94, led research on the fossils of the Burgess Shale in British Columbia, Canada. His team's studies of these fossils, which date to about 505 million years ago, revolutionized our understanding of the 'Cambrian Explosion', the origin of all the major animal body plans. Whittington was also the world's leading authority on trilobites, diverse marine arthropods of Palaeozoic age \u2014 the era between 542 million and 251 million years ago \u2014 that fascinate professionals and collectors alike. Whittington continued to publish on them into his nineties.  Whittington grew up in Birmingham, UK, and developed a lifelong interest in Lower Palaeozoic rocks and fossils as a PhD student at Birmingham University. He mapped the geology of the Berwyn Hills in north Wales, determining the age of the rocks using brachiopods and trilobites. In 1938, a Commonwealth Fellowship took him to the Peabody Museum at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut, where he focused on trilobites, including blind forms called trinucleids, which are characteristic of rocks of Ordovician age (dating to about 488 million to 444 million years ago). Whittington became enthralled by the extra morphological detail afforded by trilobites that have been replaced by silica during fossilization. Silicified specimens do not have to be dug out of the rock; they can be isolated by dissolving limestone in acid \u2014 leaving the fossils intact. Whittington married an American \u2014 Dorothy Arnold, who would be his constant companion for more than 50 years \u2014 before he left Yale in 1940 and took up a lectureship in Rangoon. The ensuing invasion of the Japanese army prompted a remarkable journey out of Burma (now Myanmar) to China, where Whittington taught at Ginling Women's College in Chengdu, Sichuan Province, until the Second World War ended in Europe. He returned to Birmingham as a lecturer in 1945. So began further fieldwork in north Wales on the stratigraphy and fossils of the classic Ordovician rocks around Bala. But Whittington continued to be fascinated by silicified trilobites and the remarkable complexities of the trilobite skeleton that they reveal. In 1947, he spent three months in Washington DC studying examples from the Ordovician rocks of Virginia, and in 1949 seized the chance to work in the United States when he was offered a post at the Museum of Comparative Zoology at Harvard in Cambridge, Massachusetts. During Whittington's 17 years at Harvard, he became established as the international authority on trilobites. In addition to monographs on faunas from Virginia, Newfoundland and north Wales, he studied the development of trilobites from larva to adult using silicified specimens. In those days \u2014 before the advent of scanning electron microscopy \u2014 he had to develop photographic techniques to illustrate tiny specimens, sometimes less than 1 millimetre in dimension. Whittington made major contributions on the morphology, biology and evolution of trilobites, including some of the earliest identifications of ancient faunal provinces on the basis of trilobite distributions and the former positions of tectonic plates. Whittington's research shifted dramatically in 1966, when he was invited to head a Geological Survey of Canada investigation of the Burgess Shale, including fieldwork in the Rockies. The Burgess Shale had been discovered by Charles Walcott of the Smithsonian Institution in Washington DC in the decade before Whittington was born. The deposit is unusual in preserving a remarkable diversity of soft-bodied creatures, which are normally lost to decay. After Walcott's preliminary descriptions, the fauna was largely ignored, until the Canadian Survey set out to study the geology of the region and to make a new \u2014 Canadian \u2014 collection from the nation's most famous fossil locality (not least because Walcott's enormous collection is at the Smithsonian). As he started the Burgess Shale project, Whittington moved from Cambridge, Massachusetts, to the University of Cambridge, UK. Arthropods were the most diverse group of animals in the Cambrian, as they are today, and it was no surprise that his first target was  Marrella , the most common arthropod in the fauna. Whittington selected the most informative specimens from among thousands collected by the Geological Survey of Canada and previously by Walcott. He and his team achieved remarkable results in their studies of Burgess Shale fossils by the painstaking application of traditional methods: a modified dental drill for removing the matrix that concealed parts of specimens, a camera lucida attached to a binocular microscope for preparing drawings, and various photographic techniques, including the use of ultraviolet light. Examining specimens preserved in different attitudes helped in restoring the three-dimensional appearance of these flattened fossils. Whittington expected his students to work independently, but he was supportive, tolerant, kind and generous \u2014 an avuncular figure to many of them, including myself. The Burgess Shale provides a much more complete picture of Cambrian life than the fossil record of shells alone. Although Walcott identified the Burgess Shale animals as early examples of modern groups, Whittington found it difficult to place some of the more unusual forms, such as  Opabinia  and  Anomalocaris , in living taxa. When he presented his preliminary restoration of  Opabinia  \u2014 with its anterior proboscis, five eyes, flap-like appendages and rudder-like tail \u2014 at a conference in 1972, the audience laughed. Such a reaction is unthinkable today: we have become used to the oddities thrown up by the Cambrian radiation, and now know that  Opabinia  is an early offshoot of the line leading to the modern arthropods. More recently, exceptionally well preserved Cambrian animals have turned up in other parts of the world, notably at Chengjiang in China and Sirius Passet in Greenland. But it was the Burgess Shale that pushed the creatures of the Cambrian into the limelight. Ironically, it was not Whittington's 1985 book  The Burgess Shale  that generated the excitement (Whittington was a remarkably modest individual), but Stephen Jay Gould's 1989 laudatory best-seller  Wonderful Life . Gould dubbed some of the more unusual Burgess Shale creatures \u201cweird wonders\u201d. However, it was Whittington who had discovered the 'weirdness'. His major contribution was in confirming the explosive nature of the Cambrian radiation and establishing a platform for interpreting the early evolution of the major invertebrate groups \u2014 now a central concern of biologists who are delving into evolutionary development and gene sequences to resolve the tree of life.

But what changes occurred in neural control during this transition? Robert Baker and colleagues have tackled this question using a thorough application of comparative neuroanatomy ( L.-H. Ma  et al .  Nature Commun.   1 , 49, doi:10.1038/ncomms1045; 2010 ) Their study centred on the developmental biology of several species of ray-finned fish, which are by far the largest group of extant fish. But it also included lobe-finned fish (a lineage that led to tetrapods) and cartilaginous fish such as sharks. Motor-neuron innervation in tetrapods (forelimb) and fish (pectoral fin) arises from the spinal cord. But for ray- and lobe-finned fish, there is evidence that these nerves also originate in the hindbrain. In following up that evidence, the authors looked at the gross anatomy of the developing pectoral fin buds of various ray-finned fish. They found that they all have a similar organization of the buds themselves, of the myotomes that give rise to muscles, and of the neuroepithelium that generates pectoral motor neurons. Using dye-labelled fin buds (pictured here in a species called the plainfin midshipman fish, attached to its egg yolk), the authors also demonstrated that the motor neurons project from both the hindbrain and the spinal cord.  Studies with transgenic zebrafish, containing a fluorescently tagged enhancer that reports the activity of the developmental gene  hoxb4a  in motor neurons, confirmed the mapping of pectoral-fin neurons. Further work involved injection of the messenger RNA for a photoactive fluorescent protein, kaede, into zebrafish embryos. The labelled neurons could then be followed during development, crucially showing that they develop  in situ  rather than migrating to their final location. Baker and colleagues' extension of their study to lobe-finned and cartilaginous fish provided evidence that, in these groups too, pectoral-fin motor-neuron control is exercised from the hindbrain as well as the spinal cord. Overall, the authors conclude that this dual contribution is the ancestral condition in vertebrates. As to the functional context, they speculate that the advent of spinal-only motor innervation of the forelimb allowed another notable characteristic of tetrapods compared with fish \u2014 their greater freedom of head movement.

Braun"}], "parsed_as_year": "2006_or_before", "body": "How far back in the human lineage does tool use extend? Fossil bones that bear evidence of butchery marks made by stone implements increase the known range of that behaviour to at least 3.2 million years ago. Palaeoanthropologists have long associated tool use with the later part of human ancestors' evolutionary history. One of the key features of 'handy man' ( Homo habilis ), first discovered at Olduvai Gorge in Tanzania, was the use of stone tools. More recently, the discovery 1  of sharp-edged stone tools in the Gona region of Ethiopia, dating to about 2.5 million years ago, modified this definition, extending the time over which tools were known to be used. But the implements found at these sites seemed too well made to have been early humans' first attempt at making such sharp-edged tools. Evidence from the Dikika area of Ethiopia now indicates that human ancestors may have been practising for almost 800,000 years before the first appearance of chipped stone tools. On  page 857  of this issue, McPherron  et al . 2  report that the fossilized bones of two animals show clear evidence of early humans using stones to remove scraps of flesh from the carcasses of large mammals. These bones were found in a region where the sediments are at least 3.2 million years old. The Dikika specimens were found in the Andedo drainage system, and a systematic survey of the area recovered several well-preserved fossils of animals that lived on this ancient landscape, possibly near a large lake. McPherron  et al . realized that some of the bone surfaces had marks indicative of butchery, presumably of carrion. Detailed analyses confirmed that the marks were made by the cutting and scraping of flesh from animal bones and therefore are evidence of butchery practices by early humans. Other marks that represent pounding on the bone surfaces suggest that these hominins (members of the human lineage) also took an interest in the nutrient-rich bone marrow. Until now, there has been no direct evidence that meat and marrow formed part of the diet of hominins at this early age. Furthermore, it is notable that these early humans departed from the typical primate pattern of disregarding relatively large animals as food. The meat and marrow of large animals must have been a valued resource, because McPherron  et al . conclude that the tool users incurred the cost of transporting stones 6 kilometres from where they occurred naturally to the site where the butchery took place. Further costs that were associated with the consumption of carrion, and were apparently worth the risk, include exposure to parasites and competition with large carnivores. This kind of behaviour may have set the stage for a greater reliance on animal tissues and more sophisticated stone-tool production by other hominin species, including our own immediate ancestors in the genus  Homo . Although palaeoanthropologists have been studying butchery marks on bones for 30 years 3 , their studies have largely been restricted to evidence from the past 2 million years. Recent discoveries show that as soon as stone tools appear in the archaeological record, hominins were using them to cut and scrape flesh from bones 4 . However, many processes can make marks on bone surfaces. McPherron  et al . 2  used various types of scanning electron microscopy to confirm that the marks on the fossil bones they studied were made by sharp-edged stones, and chemical analyses of the bone surfaces confirmed that the marks were made in the deep past. This is not the first surprise from the Dikika region. The well-preserved skeleton of a juvenile  Australopithecus afarensis  was recovered 5  less than 300 metres from the DIK-55 site where the butchered bones were found. McPherron  et al . relied on extensive geological mapping of the region to show that the youngest deposits in the Andedo drainage system date to more than 3.2 million years ago. This therefore is the minimum age for the specimens, but they may be up to 3.39 million years old. McPherron  et al . attribute the butchered bones to the use of sharp-edged stones by  A. afarensis , the species that the famous specimen 'Lucy' belongs to. Although no hominin bones were found at DIK-55, the only early human known to be present in the Dikika region at that time is  A. afarensis . This provides exciting evidence of how  A. afarensis  behaved. At one time, the species was considered to be a relatively primitive hominin, but this perception is being redefined. For example, it now seems that Lucy's kin had body proportions that were more similar to those of humans than of apes 6 . Analyses of the hand of  A. afarensis  show that it had relatively short fingers that would allow the kind of fine-scale manipulation necessary for tool use 7 . A recently discovered skeleton from the Woranso\u2013Mille area of Ethiopia suggests that  A. afarensis  did not have the ape-like, 'funnel-shaped' thorax usually associated with a large digestive tract and low-quality diet 8 . Perhaps the findings that these hominins used tools and had a carnivorous component to their diet should not have been so unexpected. Nonetheless, many scientists will be surprised that hominins were using tools more than 3 million years ago, because of the scant evidence of this behaviour until now. McPherron  et al . note that early tool use was probably infrequent and did not result in the large accumulations of artefacts and bones that usually catch the eye of archaeologists and palaeontologists. The authors can confirm only the use of sharp-edged stones, which may have been picked up from the ground rather than made by actively chipping rocks. If tool use has such a deep ancestry in the human lineage, the value of using sharp-edged stones may have been independently discovered by hominins at several points during our evolutionary history 9 . This makes identifying the tenuous link between stone-tool forms and hominin species later on in time even more difficult. There is the potential for discovering more evidence of this behaviour not only at Dikika but also elsewhere. Fossils of  A. afarensis  have been found in various places in Kenya, Tanzania and Ethiopia, and determining whether this species was a habitual tool user will require the identification of several sites where butchered bones occur in sediments of similar antiquity. More surprises surely await us in the fossil-rich sedimentary basins of East Africa. Reprints and Permissions"},

The neural circuit that signals instructions to start and stop is now revealed. Learning to execute a new action in a sequence \u2014 from start to finish \u2014 is essential for survival and subserves many routine behaviours and everyday activities, such as shifting the gear in a car or playing a musical instrument. Action sequences are learned, and eventually, with practice, are performed automatically, through an implicit learning process that involves changes in neuronal activity in specific brain structures. On  page 457  of this issue, Jin and Costa 1  show that neurons in two brain structures \u2014 the nucleus striatum and the substantia nigra, constituting the nigrostriatal circuit \u2014 can signal the initiation and termination of self-paced action sequences, and that this 'start/stop' neuronal activity emerges as animals learn how to execute a specific action sequence. This neuronal circuit in the basal ganglia \u2014 an interconnected set of neuronal clusters, in the subcortical region of the brain, that includes the nucleus striatum and the substantia nigra \u2014 contributes to the learning and execution of acquired behavioural sequences by interacting with the brain's cortex 2  ( Fig. 1 ). In particular, the input structure of the circuit \u2014 the nucleus striatum \u2014 is essential in the control of behavioural outputs. This structure's activity is modulated by the neurotransmitter dopamine, which is released by neurons of the substantia nigra. The activity of the nucleus striatum is believed to have a crucial role in learning how to select actions that lead to reward and to avoiding punishment 3 . It is also thought to be involved in various forms of learning and memory, such as procedural learning, skill learning, habit learning and reward-associated learning 4 . Jin and Costa's finding 1 , that the neurons of the nucleus striatum and the substantia nigra make a circuit to signal the start/stop of action sequences, highlights the crucial role played by the basal ganglia, and in particular the striatum, in learning and 'crystallizing' newly acquired action sequences 4 . It also points to the potential part played by long-lasting changes in the activity of striatal neurons in motor learning and behavioural control. The strength of the synaptic junctions that connect neurons can change with experience \u2014 a concept known as synaptic plasticity. Several mechanisms can lead to synaptic plasticity in the nigrostriatal circuit. The excitatory synapses connecting to a type of nucleus striatum neuron called a projecting spiny neuron exhibit the main forms of synaptic plasticity \u2014 long-term depression (LTD) and long-term potentiation (LTP) 5 ; these represent the molecular basis of learning and memory. In the nucleus striatum, LTD and LTP depend on the interaction between dopamine and another key neurotransmitter, glutamate. In particular, LTP depends on activation of both the D1 dopamine receptor and NMDA ( N -methyl- D -aspartate)-type glutamate receptors 5 . Jin and Costa 1  show that, in mutant mice carrying a striatal-specific deletion in the NMDA receptor, the percentage of neurons displaying start/stop activity is significantly lower than in normal animals, and that this percentage does not increase with training. Moreover, the mutant mice show little evidence of sequence learning. These observations suggest that a functional NMDA receptor in the striatum is essential for sequence learning, by affecting learning-related start/stop activity, and thus provides further evidence that NMDA-dependent neuronal activity and plasticity may be essential for the brain to store learned behaviours. The start/stop activity that Jin and Costa observe in the nigrostriatal circuit can be compared to a traffic light, organizing actions by specifically signalling the initiation and termination of each action sequence during sequence learning ( Fig. 1 ). Initiation and termination of action sequences is usually impaired in human disorders involving the basal ganglia. Parkinson's disease, for example, is a typical basal-ganglion neurodegenerative disorder in which the activity of the nigrostriatal circuit is deeply compromised. In this disease, dopamine-releasing neurons of the substantia nigra degenerate; the nucleus striatum loses its connection to dopamine-releasing neurons; and motor and cognitive symptoms surface 6 . In parallel, striatal synapses can no longer undergo the main forms of synaptic plasticity 5 . Given the important role of the nigrostriatal circuit in motor learning and control, patients with Parkinson's disease often cannot learn new action sequences 7  and show a selective difficulty in initiating and terminating motor sequences 6 . For instance, they usually have great difficulty in initiating gait, in rising from deep chairs or in rolling over in bed; but, at the same time, once they start to walk, their gait may rapidly and involuntarily quicken in the forward direction, making them fall. For these reasons, Jin and Costa's results 1  in mice not only are an important step towards understanding striatal physiology, but also could have potentially significant implications for unravelling the mechanisms of disabling neurological diseases such as Parkinson's. Indeed, it could be that, in Parkinson's disease, functional alterations in the nigrostriatal circuit impair striatal start/stop activity during sequence learning. In turn, loss of a 'traffic light' organizing the initiation and termination of each action sequence might lead to the onset of deficits in sequence learning in patients, and to clinical symptoms mirroring the inability of the circuit to signal when each action sequence should start and stop. Further experiments in animal models, as well as clinical studies should explore this intriguing hypothetical possibility. Reprints and Permissions"},

Sadly, it's also known for its perplexing plunge towards extinction. It is estimated that only 120\u2013220 pairs remain. The bird's summer breeding grounds on the Russian Chukotskiy peninsula are inaccessible to all but a few ornithologists, and \u2014 despite occasional sightings across a vast range from India to Malaysia \u2014 the main wintering sites were unknown. Z\u00f6ckler and colleagues, however, now show both what the likely threats are to the overwintering birds and how those threats might be reduced (C. Z\u00f6ckler  et al .  Wader Study Group Bull.   117 , 1\u20138; 2010). With no apparent sign of habitat degradation at the breeding site, Z\u00f6ckler and colleagues searched for the birds' wintering area. In January 2010, they found an estimated half of the global overwintering population in the Bay of Martaban in Myanmar. The team identified one bird that had been tagged with a leg flag on the breeding grounds in 2003. Analysis of carbon and nitrogen isotopes from the few, winter-grown, feathers collected when the bird was tagged showed that this individual was in the centre of the densest data cluster, implying that it was in the heart of the wintering area.  Z\u00f6ckler  et al . went further. On making enquiries, they found that local hunters use mist nets to catch birds for the pot: an estimated 30,000 shorebirds are killed annually in this single bay, which harbours up to 150,000 migratory shorebirds. Most of the 26 hunters from 15 villages who were interviewed were familiar with spoon-billed sandpipers, and reported regularly catching them. Paradoxically, this second discovery could be good news. Only five of the interviewees were full-time professional hunters and their main targets are much larger birds. The authors propose that incentives should be offered to the villagers to conserve the birds; village elders may then ensure that there is no hunting. Such mechanisms have worked elsewhere in Myanmar. Z\u00f6ckler  et al . say that, without intervention, the spoon-billed sandpiper could become extinct within 10\u201320 years. But now, thanks to their persistent investigation and willingness to engage with local people, it may not. The story illustrates how conservation is as much a social science as a biological one. When the two come together, there is hope for real change. Reprints and Permissions"},

Terence Ingold, one of the most influential mycologists of the twentieth century, died in Northumberland, UK, on 31 May at the inspiring age of 104. His researches spanned more than 70 years, and there have been few, if any, individuals who have made a more significant impact on the appreciation of fungi by the wider scientific community. In the 1930s he discovered a ubiquitous but previously overlooked group of aquatic fungi, later called the Ingoldian hyphomycetes. But he is probably better known for his lifelong interest in mechanisms of spore dispersal. Ingold began his laboratory investigations on fungi in 1926, as an undergraduate at Queen's University in Belfast. Doctoral work at London's Royal College of Science, now part of Imperial College London, was followed by lectureships at the universities of Reading and Leicester, and (in 1944) by a chair at Birkbeck College, University of London. Ingold's study of aquatic fungi began in 1938 with his analysis of water samples taken from a brook that ran close to his home north of Leicester. The spores of some of these fungi assume beautiful shapes, many with the form of stars or crescents, which collide with drowning leaf fragments that serve as their food. They become rafted on the surface of air bubbles, and may escape into the air. When Ingold presented his discovery at a meeting in Cambridge, UK, one smart alec countered that he had simply misidentified some leaf hairs. The folly of this pronouncement is proven by continuing international research on the diversity and ecology of these microorganisms. Beyond their abundance in streams, Ingoldians have been found in rainwater run-off from buildings, in melting snow and ice, and in plant tissues, in which they may be active symbionts rather than agents of decay. But Ingold's first mycological love was for the biophysical, in the form of the parade of graceful propulsion mechanisms that have evolved among the fungi. Examples include the hydrostatic guns that squirt spore-containing sporangia skyward above streams of pressurized fluid, and the remarkable process used by spores to jump from mushroom gills. He revelled in these phenomena, drawing on a keen knowledge of physics to advance a discipline more often associated with the non-experimental cataloguing of new species. The mushroom mechanism was the trickiest he tackled. It had perplexed mycologists since its description in the nineteenth century and had fascinated another great experimentalist, A. H. Reginald Buller (1874\u20131944). Ingold studied the process for decades and designed some of the crucial experiments that demonstrated that it operates as a kind of catapult energized by surface tension. The artillery fungus,  Sphaerobolus stellatus , was another of his favourites, with its spectacular snap-buckling mechanism that shoots a pinhead-sized sporangium over a distance of 6 metres. Many of his experiments on spore movements seemed inspired by Heath Robinson (or Rube Goldberg, for US readers), and included the study of cultures in a hyperbaric chamber and readings from a 'spore clock' whose face became spattered with discharged spores. But these contraptions were highly effective in providing insights into the way that fungi work. By deciphering the physics of spore discharge processes, Ingold helped other researchers to elucidate the complex relationships between weather conditions and the spread of epidemic plant diseases and mould-based allergies. Ingold's first book,  Spore Discharge in Land Plants  (1939), which was more mycological than botanical, was followed by a half-dozen exclusively fungal titles written, primarily, for students. His  Fungal Spores: Their Liberation and Dispersal  (1971) was a masterly guide to the field, and is one of the classic books most likely to be found on the bookshelves of mycologists and plant pathologists throughout the world. In recent days, I have been ruminating on the fact that this book was published as a sort of mid-career offering when he was 66 years old. He continued to study the fungi for another 30 years. Ingold's sense of humour was apparent through his published cartoons of fungi. But he did not come from the stand-up-comedian school of scientific educators, and was a deeply thoughtful man. Following his retirement in 1972, he loved to walk the country lanes around his home in Oxfordshire and ponder questions about fungi, and life in general. During these years, he studied fungi in a home laboratory and published numerous papers concerning fungal development and spore discharge. As a student, I joined him on some of his strolls, imbibing fragments of knowledge from a gentleman who knew the name of every plant and fungus, and could add an anecdote about each organism's biology. I would be reduced to nodding in silent acquiescence, hoping he would be kind enough to defer testing my knowledge. Yet for a man who lived so long and knew so much, his advice to the neophyte was limited. When I asked him for tips for matching his vigorous longevity, he uttered one unhelpful word: \u201cGenes.\u201d Terence Ingold was characteristically humble about the significance of his scientific contributions. He confessed regret that he had not spent more time in the laboratory, having instead invested much of his energy on administrative tasks. But colleagues in Britain and abroad benefited greatly from his distraction from the fungi. He kept his department in London running during the final months of the Second World War. And he travelled widely in the 1950s and 1960s as a representative of the University of London, assisting in the development of higher education in countries that had obtained independence from Britain. He was particularly influential in the foundation, in 1966, of the University of Botswana, Lesotho and Swaziland, which offered a regional alternative to education in South Africa during the apartheid era. He made time for mycological investigations during many of these journeys, and claimed that, if he were \u201ctransported to a part of the world without knowledge of its locality\u201d, he could \u201cmake a very rough guess as to its latitude by examining the spora of a suitable stream\u201d. In small ways in the lab, and in a larger manner in Africa, he made the world a more interesting place. Reprints and Permissions"},

I met Richard Gregory when I was an undergraduate at Cambridge in 1964, after a lecture on the differences between computers and brains. My nervousness was immediately dispelled by a string of jokes and puns. Shaking with laughter, he told me that he was planning a series of historical recipe books, starting with  Cooking in Ancient Greece . Eventually we talked science, discussing whether the perceived distance of a sound source influences how loud the sound seems. \u201cWhy don't we do an experiment?\u201d he said, welcoming me into the grotto of wonders that was his lab. Gregory was a pioneer in cognitive science. He worked in an era dominated by neurophysiologists revealing the 'bottom-up' processing of sensory signals in the eye, the ear and the brain. Yet he championed the role of 'top-down' influences in perception \u2014 those based on experience and understanding. Although he won many honours (he held 11 honorary degrees and was a fellow of the Royal Society), the significance of his work has yet to be fully recognized. This may be partly because many of his most important ideas were communicated in popular writing and editorials, rather than through academic papers. Gregory, who died on 17 May, was the son of Christopher Gregory, the first director of the University of London Observatory, and his wife Helen Patricia. He learned simple electronics in the 'radio club' at King Alfred School in Hampstead, north London, and his knowledge of instrumentation grew during six years of work on communications and radar in the Royal Air Force (RAF). He arrived in Cambridge in 1947 on an RAF scholarship to read 'moral sciences'. In his first two years, dominated by philosophy, he \u201cjust missed Wittgenstein\u201d but was tutored by Bertrand Russell. In his final year Gregory concentrated on experimental psychology, and was one of the last students of Frederic Bartlett \u2014 his \u201cmost revered intellectual grandfather\u201d. Bartlett asked Gregory to stay on after graduation, and from 1950 to 1953 Gregory worked at the Medical Research Council's applied psychology unit in the department of experimental psychology. Like Bartlett, Gregory was captivated by the idea of the former director, Kenneth Craik, that 'internal models' of the outside world are physically implemented in the brain and used predictively to direct behaviour. In 1953, Gregory (without a PhD) was given a staff position. He created a 'special senses laboratory' with British and US grants, and filled it with fancy equipment and talented researchers and engineers. I remember his crowded workshop \u2014 with his solid-image microscope and a three-dimensional drawing machine; his image-aggregation telescope for overcoming the effects of atmospheric disturbance; and, over in a corner, devices for transducing tidal power. Gregory's delight in translating mental concepts into physical devices mirrored his fascination with the translation of retinal images into mental concepts. Although he viewed the neurophysiologists in the adjoining laboratory as \u201csuperior beings\u201d, Gregory saw perception as \u201ccreatively intelligent\u201d, not just automatic analysis. Two lines of evidence particularly influenced him. The first was his study of a 52-year-old man, blind from an early age, who received corneal transplants. As soon as his bandages were removed, he could interpret by sight things he had learned to understand through touch \u2014 capital letters and the face of a clock. But he was perceptually blind to things outside his tactile experience. \u201cVision depends on knowledge derived from active exploration giving meaning to the eyes' images,\u201d Gregory wrote. His second source of inspiration was his work on visual illusions. This was partly pursued in his hugely popular undergraduate classes \u2014 often conducted in total darkness \u2014 in which twisted luminous pieces of wire apparently changed shape as they were passed around. Gregory saw such illusions as the effect of top-down influences that were normally needed to resolve the ambiguity of retinal images. He argued that many illusions of shape and size result from the inappropriate scaling of apparent size, triggered by unconscious interpretation of perspective cues in the pattern or object being observed. On the basis of his work on illusions, Gregory proposed that perceptions are like predictive scientific hypotheses \u2014 the theme of his best-selling books  Eye and Brain  (1966),  The Intelligent Eye  (1970) and  Mind in Science  (1981). In 1967, he moved to Edinburgh to help found the department of machine intelligence and perception. Here, an offer of a deconsecrated church as lab space was withdrawn when the Church of Scotland discovered that the scientists intended to make robots! Tensions between the lab leaders, however, spurred Gregory to move to Bristol in 1970, to establish the Brain and Perception Laboratory. At Bristol, where he continued to work until his death, Gregory studied eye\u2013hand coordination in patients with Parkinson's disease; perceptual 'filling-in' of the blind spot; and his beloved illusions. He also focused his creativity increasingly on public communication, in which he'd shown considerable flair years before: when, in 1946, he was given the job of explaining radar to the public at a bomb site on Oxford Street in London, he drew 4 million visitors in 6 months. An encounter in 1970 with Frank Oppenheimer \u2014 founder of the Exploratorium in San Francisco \u2014 inspired Gregory to create the Exploratory in Bristol. This was Britain's first interactive science centre and most of the exhibits were designed by Gregory himself. He also collaborated with art historian Ernst Gombrich in designing a major exhibition, 'Illusion in nature and art', for the Institute of Contemporary Arts in London, in 1973. Throughout his career, Gregory delighted non-specialists with his entertaining lectures and outpouring of books. \u201cThe adventure of science,\u201d he once wrote, \u201cshould be a major basis of general culture.\u201d Despite his impressive physical stature and penetrating intellect, Richard was entirely without hubris \u2014 blind to age or class. The only thing that mattered to him was enthusiasm, and his own was highly infectious. On 30 May, his friends and family gathered in Bristol to celebrate his life. The event was fittingly entitled a FUNeral. Richard would have shaken with laughter. Reprints and Permissions"},

P. Bhat  et al .  Nature Phys.  doi:10.1038/NPHYS1682; 2010 ). It's easy to observe this effect: take a blob of saliva from the top of your tongue, place it between your thumb and index finger, then slowly pull your digits apart. With practice, you'll form a thread of fluid that initially thins and drains, but that eventually forms a string of different-sized spheres (pictured). Newtonian fluids, such as water, don't do this \u2014 instead, the threads quickly break.  Saliva differs from water in containing naturally occurring polymeric molecules that make it viscoelastic. This property was thought to cause the beads-on-a-string effect, yet computer models of viscoelastic liquids couldn't reproduce the phenomenon. Bhat  et al . report a new computer model that factors in inertia. They find that inertia causes beads to form even on threads of low-viscosity Newtonian fluids. But in viscoelastic fluids the beads last longer, grow bigger and become more spherical. The authors' simulations also reveal that enhanced radial flow occurs at certain regions of threads, causing additional, smaller beads to form in viscoelastic fluids. They conclude that the beads-on-a-string effect results from the interplay between capillary, viscous, elastic and inertial forces. The model offers fresh ways to explore the behaviour of materials deformed beyond their equilibrium. This is of relevance to commercial processes such as electrospinning, in which electric charges are used to draw fibres from liquids. Reprints and Permissions"},

But differences among various analyses and inconsistencies with other indicators merit attention. Global atmospheric temperatures at Earth's surface are often taken as an indicator of global warming. Yet the atmosphere is battered by all sorts of natural variability associated with weather phenomena. More robust indicators of a warming planet come from evidence of increasing ocean heat content and associated sea-level rise. Yet observing systems that capitalize on these insights are in their infancy. On  page 334  of this issue, a step forward is reported by Lyman  et al . 1  \u2014 they find a robust warming of the global upper ocean to be present in the data, in spite of considerable uncertainties arising from the observations themselves. In September 2009 a meeting 2  called OceanObs'09, involving more than 600 scientists from 36 nations, took place in Venice and focused on progress in observing the ocean since the Initial Ocean-observing System was mooted a decade earlier at the OceanObs'99 conference. The participants not only assessed the revolutionary advances that have taken place in ocean observations, but also considered how the observations, their processing and their translation into useful information for decision-makers should progress into the future. The revolution has been brought about by two major developments. The first is millimetre-precision altimetry from satellites to give sea level globally since 1992; the second is the Argo profiling float system of nominally 3,000 floats that provide vertical profiles of temperature and salinity over the upper 2,000 metres of the ocean every 10 days or so. The latter has been built up to approach global coverage and the nominal numbers since about 2003. Before then, the bulk of the observations of the ocean were from expendable bathythermographs (XBTs) dropped from ships along their tracks as opportunities arose. As a result, coverage was spotty and irregular, and missing over many regions such as the Southern Ocean. The XBTs recorded temperatures, but their depths were estimated on the basis of an assigned drop rate, which turned out to be sensitive to the exact design and character of the XBT probe. Recent careful comparisons with calibrated probes deployed from research vessels have shown the need for corrections 3 . The severe under-sampling of the ocean until about five years ago, along with the variety of methods used to correct for problems and biases, has led to many estimates of how the temperatures in the ocean have changed over time. Of particular interest for climate is the vertically integrated ocean heat content. The reprocessing of XBT and Argo observations has resolved some issues highlighted in the last report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 4 , in which inflated decadal variability was evidently due to changes over time in XBT design, deployment and data analysis 5 . But there remains a surprisingly large spread among different estimates of ocean heat content. Lyman  et al . 1  delve into the origins of these differences, and compile and reprocess a common data set for the upper 700 m of the ocean to isolate how various assumptions affect the results. They perform a detailed error analysis that helps determine the confidence in the results and where improvements can be made. Their conclusions provide a valuable caution for users of these data. In spite of all the difficulties, Lyman  et al . are able to demonstrate a robust warming of the global upper ocean from 1993 to 2008, depicted by the red line in  Figure 1 , which averages 0.64 \u00b1 0.29 watts per square metre (95% confidence interval) for the Earth as a whole. This is reasonably consistent with expectations from other indications of global warming 6 . Nonetheless, the results reveal that all curves flatten out after 2003 (as seen in the black line in  Fig. 1 ; see also ref.  7 , for example), suggesting that ocean warming has stalled. However, independent analysis 8  of the full-depth Argo floats for 2003 to 2008 suggests that the 6-year heat-content increase is 0.77 \u00b1 0.11 W m \u22122  for the global ocean or 0.54 W m \u22122  for the entire Earth, indicating that substantial warming may be taking place below the upper 700 m ( Fig. 1 , blue line). Although Lyman and colleagues' paper 1  reinforces the overall view that the ocean has been warming at a rate consistent with radiative imbalance estimates from anthropogenic climate change, the slowdown since 2003 is at odds with top-of-atmosphere radiation measurements 9 . This discrepancy suggests that further problems may be hidden within the ocean observations and their processing. It also highlights the need to do better, and the prospects for that. Experience in the atmosphere has long highlighted the desirability of working with 'anomalies' as departures from a well-established climatology. Moreover, methods of analysis and interpolation of gaps in space and time should take account of the warming climate, and care is needed not to bias results towards background values. As the relevant analytical methods mature, ocean heat content is likely to become a key indicator of climate change. Reprints and Permissions"},

Surprisingly, it turns out to be an important promoter of various cancers. For more than two decades, CD95 \u2014 also known as Fas and APO-1 \u2014 has been considered a killer, the  capo di tutti capi  of death receptors in the tumour-necrosis-factor receptor family. Interaction of this cell-surface receptor with its ligand, CD95L, or with activating antibodies induces rapid apoptotic death in many cell types, and injection of such ligands or antibodies into animals results in liver destruction and death. Moreover, deletion or mutation of CD95 causes an immune-related disease due to loss of apoptosis. In many cells, even when apoptosis is blocked, CD95 induces necrotic cell death through a different signalling pathway. So the idea that CD95 actually promotes cancer \u2014 which is generally characterized by decreased rather than increased cell death \u2014 seems ridiculous. But on  page 492  of this issue, Chen and colleagues 1  provide overwhelming evidence that this is indeed the case, a finding that is tantamount to a paradigm shift. The authors use various human tumour-cell lines, primary cancer cell lines and mouse models of spontaneous and damage-induced cancer to show that reducing or abolishing CD95 compromises tumour growth without causing cell death. Furthermore, they find that tumour-derived CD95L is necessary for tumour promotion, presumably acting in a cell-intrinsic (autocrine) way. Their conclusion, that CD95L\u2013CD95 signalling is generally important for the generation and maintenance of cancers, is therefore compelling. Hints that CD95 has non-apoptotic functions have surfaced repeatedly in the past. (Sometimes, however, a viewpoint becomes so ingrained in our collective scientific consciousness that alternatives go unheeded.) For example, previous work has shown that activation of CD95 has a co-stimulatory effect with antigen-receptor signalling in T lymphocytes, and that neurons in which CD95 is triggered display neurite outgrowth 2 . In addition, Chen and colleagues 1  show that ablation of CD95 in the liver slows compensatory proliferation of liver cells following partial liver resection (hepatectomy). So how does CD95 promote growth? This receptor's only known ligand, CD95L, can be either membrane bound or cleaved to a soluble form. The membrane-bound form is required for CD95L-induced apoptosis, and animals that can express only the soluble form develop immune-system abnormalities more rapidly than do CD95L-deficient mice 3 . Remarkably, these animals also develop hepatic sarcoma, a form of cancer rarely seen in animals lacking CD95 or CD95L. The idea that the soluble form of CD95L might be responsible for CD95 signals that promote tumour formation is therefore attractive. Indeed, patients with cancer often have high levels of soluble CD95L in their blood. Inflammation is an important factor in promoting cancer 4 . So one idea is that CD95 aids tumour growth by inducing inflammation. Expression of CD95L in abnormal locations such as pancreatic islet cells or transplanted tissues can induce a dramatic infiltration of white blood cells 5  \u2014 a hallmark of inflammation. Against this idea, however, Chen  et al . report that CD95L promotes tumour growth by mechanisms within the tumour, with no profound differences in inflammation between tumours expressing CD95 and those that do not express it. Furthermore, earlier work 6  has shown that, unlike membrane-bound CD95L, soluble CD95L does not promote inflammation. Activation of death receptors, including CD95, triggers several signalling pathways besides that leading to apoptosis ( Fig. 1 ). But which of these signals might promote tumour growth? It has been proposed that activation of the transcription factor NF-\u03baB (probably through the RIPK1 enzyme, which is recruited to the death-induced signalling complex, DISC) might account for the growth-promoting effects of CD95 activation 3 . But this seems unlikely, because although CD95 promotes damage-induced hepatocellular carcinoma 1 , this form of cancer is exacerbated in mice that lack the canonical NF-\u03baB signalling pathway in their livers 4 . Alternatively, Chen  et al . 1  suggest a role for the enzyme JNK, and increased expression of EGR-1 and Fos transcription factors downstream of it. They show that chemical inhibition of JNK retards the growth of CD95-expressing tumour cells. Moreover, CD95 activation in liver cells undergoing proliferation after partial hepatectomy (a situation that may be mechanistically similar to tumour initiation) profoundly increases levels of EGR-1 and Fos. Unfortunately, we know almost nothing about how CD95 might activate JNK. Soluble CD95L does not trigger JNK activation 7 , but a deeper problem is that, in the absence of CD95, JNK can be activated in many other ways. Indeed, several other related proteins \u2014 such as tumour-necrosis factor \u2014 readily induce JNK, and it is difficult to see why CD95 would be needed for this signal to promote cancer. In other words, what is so special about CD95? Apoptosis in response to CD95 activity is controlled by proteins that associate with the intracellular death domain of this receptor, such as the adaptor protein FADD, leading to the recruitment of DISC and activation of the enzyme caspase-8 ( Fig. 1 ). FLIP \u2014 a caspase-like molecule without proteolytic activity \u2014 alters this signalling in favour of survival. Presumably, this is how tumour cells avoid death signalling by CD95. But there is a hint that this is not the whole story. Animals with defective CD95 expression exhibit delayed liver-cell proliferation and liver regeneration after partial hepatectomy, whereas animals with a mutation in CD95 known as lpr cg , which disrupts the structure of the death domain, show normal regeneration 8 . Remarkably, when lpr cg -mutant mice were provided with a wild-type haematopoietic system (to prevent the immune-system disease), they developed liver tumours 9 . It seems, therefore, that the tumour-promoting signal that CD95 generates \u2014 perhaps normally offset by CD95-induced apoptosis \u2014 persists in this mutant. Such a signal might come about through the recruitment and activation of the enzyme PI3 kinase. In glioblastoma cells, activated CD95 recruits both the Src-family kinase Yes and the p85 subunit of PI3 kinase, leading to PI3-kinase activation 10 . Yes and p85 interact with the membrane-proximal region of the CD95 death domain, which is likely to remain intact in the lpr cg  mutant, although this has not been tested. Thus, CD95 activation may promote the activity of the signalling molecule AKT, downstream of PI3 kinase, to induce cell proliferation. Whatever the mechanism, a general role for autocrine CD95 signalling in promoting cancer is a stunning revelation that goes against many of the prevailing ideas of what this receptor does. There are obvious practical consequences as we explore the benefits of blocking CD95L\u2013CD95 interactions in cancer therapy. But perhaps most of all, as we confirm the generality of this process in cancers, there is our realization that this 'wolf' \u2014 this potentially deadly tumour-promoting mechanism \u2014 has been there all along, disguised as a mechanism of cell death.

The fingerprints of such mantle processes have been found in the Mediterranean region. Horizontal and vertical motions near Earth's surface are typically stately in pace \u2014 some 0.1 to 10 centimetres per year. But their net effects over long periods can be major. After decades to centuries, velocity differences across faults in Earth's crust produce slip deficits of up to a few tens of metres, which are resolved during large earthquakes. On timescales of millions of years, surface movements result in mountain building, in the opening of ocean basins and in the separation of continents. Faccenna and Becker ( page 602  of this issue) 1  show that convective action in Earth's mantle, at depths extending from about 100 to 2,900 kilometres, is partly responsible for surface dynamics in one of the most complex tectonic areas in the world \u2014 the Mediterranean region. Almost all scientists now accept that the motion of tectonic plates is part of a sluggish convection system in the mantle that is slowly cooling Earth's interior. But it has been difficult to predict such surface motions as the mechanical part of this heat engine, because we have had only a sketchy knowledge of the distribution and magnitude of density anomalies that drive convective flow. From studies of the propagation of seismic waves, it has long been known that Earth has largely the same (spherical) structure as an onion. The outer spherical layer is the crust, the layers beneath it being the upper and lower mantle above the spherical core. But knowing this was not enough to understand the dynamics. Convection is driven by relatively small density anomalies within the mantle and core layers, and imaging these anomalies was much more of a challenge. Since the 1980s, the creation of a worldwide network of high-quality seismometers and the development of tomographic mapping techniques have changed this situation drastically 2 . Anomalies that could be tied to upwellings and downwellings were first imaged in the upper mantle, and later in the lower mantle 3 . Another line of investigation \u2014 geodynamic flow models 4  \u2014 developed in concert with the seismological findings. Historically, three-dimensional information was restricted to crustal levels, and explanations for the three-dimensional crustal structure were sought at crustal levels too. But as tomographic information for the upper mantle became available, complications in plate-tectonic processes were identified, for example in the Mediterranean region 5 . Faccenna and Becker 1  now include the anomalies and flow of the entire mantle in their next-generation geodynamic model. The idea that flow in the lower mantle contributes to the deformation of Earth's surface is not new. A study 6  of uplift of southern Africa above a wide lower-mantle upwelling convincingly demonstrated such an effect. But not only do Faccenna and Becker bring planetary-scale mantle flow into the picture, they also show that flow driven by smaller-scale anomalies is needed to understand a plate-boundary zone such as the Mediterranean. The tectonic structure of the Mediterranean is complicated, and especially interesting for that reason. Overall, two major plates, the African and Eurasian, are converging here. This convergence is not simply accommodated in a single subduction zone where one plate is being thrust below the other, however; the region has a number of smaller subduction zones and (micro)plates, the behaviour of which seems to be independent of the convergence dynamics of their larger fellows. From models of mantle flow, Faccenna and Becker demonstrate that smaller-scale convection in the mantle can account for much of that behaviour. Intriguingly, they find that flow beneath the Mediterranean region is significantly affected by the northward inflow of mantle material from beneath the Arabian continent. We are not yet at the stage at which we have a full appreciation of a plate-boundary region such as the Mediterranean. This work 1  is just one step towards the development of a fully dynamic model that accurately reflects all the observed movement and deformation of tectonic plates, including microplates. Model representations of the connection of surface plates to mantle downwellings need to be improved. Flexing and deforming plates need to become integral parts of flow models to reliably predict dynamic topography. Only then will it be possible to convert the eighteenth-century geologist James Hutton's principle of uniformitarianism, \u201cThe present is the key to the past\u201d, to \u201cThe present is the key to the future\u201d \u2014 that is, only then will it become possible to predict the future behaviour of Earth's surface.

From the mid-1950s to the early 1980s, perhaps the most well-known section of  Scientific American  was the 'Mathematical games' column of Martin Gardner. In recognition of its success, three eminent mathematicians dedicated their 1982 book  Winning Ways for Your Mathematical Plays  to Gardner, who, they wrote, \u201cbrought more mathematics to more millions than anyone else\u201d. Yet Gardner was not a mathematician. His only degree was in philosophy. Gardner, who died on 22 May, aged 95, was born in Tulsa, Oklahoma, to a devout Methodist mother and an oil-geologist father. He was drawn to mathematics, science, magic and writing at a very young age, and published a 'New color divination' in a magic journal at just 16. He wanted to go to the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, but in the 1930s entry to Caltech required the completion of two years at a liberal-arts college first. Instead, Gardner went to the University of Chicago in Illinois and studied philosophy, graduating in 1936. After various jobs, including assistant oil editor for  The Tulsa Tribune , and four years in the navy, Gardner returned to Chicago and began writing short stories for  Esquire , spending much of his spare time inventing, demonstrating and selling magic tricks. In 1947, he took a post in New York as editor of  Humpty Dumpty , a children's magazine, and in the same year wrote an article on logic machines for  Scientific American .  In the early 1940s, four graduate students of Princeton University, including Richard Feynman, had found a way of folding a paper strip into a hexagon that could then be manipulated to show different hexagonal faces. Gardner heard about these 'flexagons' and drove to Princeton to talk to the two students still there. His article about flexagons was accepted by  Scientific American  for the December 1956 edition, and, as a result, in the following issue Gardner began his 'Mathematical games' column with an article on magic squares. His lack of formal mathematics training turned out to be his forte \u2014 working slowly and carefully through the ideas helped him to explain them. Gardner's column, which ran for 311 issues over 25 years and was collected into 15 books, soon became the main outlet for new and offbeat mathematical ideas. Enthusiastic readers sent letters pointing out corrections, new results and suggestions for further columns. Gardner replied to most of them himself, luring many young people into mathematical careers. His expositions turned numerous games and objects into fixtures of Western culture: the board game Hex; the Soma-cube puzzle; the 'polyomino' shape commonly used in puzzles; the computer game  Life ; even Roger Penrose's non-periodic tilings of the plane, which in turn have led to 'quasicrystals' and even to non-periodic pattern designs on toilet paper! Gardner also popularized Penrose's 'impossible staircase' and 'impossible triangle', or tribar \u2014 an apparently solid object made of three straight square beams that meet at right angles at the vertices of the triangle. Gardner's greatest scoop occurred when the cryptographer Ronald Rivest told him of his work on trapdoor ciphers \u2014 ways of encoding and decoding information that provide the secure encryption and public-key cryptography now used to hide information in almost every form of electronic communication. From 1977 until 1994, the CIA attempted to suppress the export of such encryption methods. But Gardner's article, published in August 1977, had already provided a detailed description of the techniques. In 1952, Gardner published  In the Name of Science  (later renamed  Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science ). In this seminal book on debunking pseudoscience, he exposed many fallacies, including theories that the Earth is flat or hollow, and various pseudoscientific speculations regarding pyramids, phrenology, UFOs and creationism. He was a founder of the Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal \u2014 now the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry. Later, he was a regular contributor to the committee's journal, the  Skeptical Inquirer , producing the monthly column 'Notes of a fringe watcher' from 1983 to 2002. Gardner's playfulness was irrepressible. In April 1975, he devoted his  Scientific American  column to \u201crecent but little known\u201d results: Fermat's last theorem and the 'four-colour problem' (in which only four colours are needed to colour the shapes on a map so that no adjacent regions are the same colour) had been disproved; a lost drawing of Leonardo da Vinci revealed that Leonardo had invented the flush toilet; and the mystery of how to win at chess had been resolved. An amazing number of readers were taken in. He also compiled two booklets of 'obscene magic tricks' \u2014 not easy to obtain. Gardner's extensive writing, even his pranks, endeared him to his followers. Tom Rodgers, a puzzle collector and philanthropist, organized an exhibition of puzzles for the opening in 1993 of what is now the Museum of Design Atlanta in Georgia, with an accompanying conference to honour Gardner. This was so popular that 'Gatherings for Gardner' have occurred in Atlanta every two years since. Several hundred mathematicians, magicians and sceptics show up, and many more have to be turned away for lack of space. Martin's writings on mathematics were just one strand in a remarkably prolific literary career. Among other things, he was an expert on Lewis Carroll \u2014 his  Annotated Alice , the definitive guide to  Alice in Wonderland , sold more than a million copies. In fact, the extent of Gardner's writing will probably not be known for several years: a current bibliography covers 350 pages, and various lists suggest that he wrote either 73 or 124 books. At the first Gardner gathering, computer scientist Don Knuth explained how Martin managed to write so much: \u201cHe didn't have a computer.\u201d Martin is one of the few people who has earned the phrase 'We shall not see his like again'. Certainly, with or without a computer, few people have bridged the 'two cultures' so successfully. Reprints and Permissions"},

By Donald Hunter \u2014 The history of occupational disease spreads over many years and, until comparatively recently, ailments like beat knee, 'stagmus', writer's cramp, grocer's itch and cotton-workers' throat were accepted as heavenly or other visitations about which little could be done. With the growth of the industrial revolution the number of diseases multiplied so much in factory, workshop and mine that few industrial workers were able to get through a life-time free from occupational disease ... This interesting book ... describes the genesis of industrial medical services and the way they have developed. Rightly, the author emphasizes that in this field prevention is better than cure, and that responsibility for prevention rests not only upon doctors but also upon the Government, architects, management, trade unions and the workers they represent. From  Nature  7 May 1960. \n               100 Years ago \n             During the last General Election much was heard about the hard lot of the German workmen and peasants who are compelled to eat black bread, and much political capital was made of it. It may therefore be interesting to inquire how much of a hardship this is from the point of view of nutritiousness and also of tastiness. The so-called black bread is made of rye, and has the property of keeping moist for a much longer time than wheaten bread ... But a consideration of the chemistry of the different breads gives no support to the idea that black bread is an inferior article of diet ... It is good food, nevertheless, and those accustomed to it often actually prefer it ... The political orator is not too particular about his facts so long as he thinks they will serve his turn, and the allegations made about black bread have been, to say the least, wanting in scientific accuracy.

James Black, Jim to his many friends and colleagues, shared the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1988 for pioneering research that led to two new classes of drug. Adrenergic \u03b2-blockers and histamine H 2 -receptor antagonists have benefited millions of patients and often saved lives. By his example, Black made a massive contribution to the concept that pharmacological receptors offer fertile ground for drug discovery. His work opened up research on biogenic amines \u2014 chemical messengers that have subsequently provided the foundation for establishing new types of drug action. This is all the more impressive because Black never received formal research training. Indeed, as a physiologist, he had to teach himself what he has termed 'analytical pharmacology'. Black, who died on 22 March, graduated in medicine from the University of St Andrews, UK, in 1946, but decided against a career as a medical practitioner. He found that \u201cthe way patients were treated was unacceptably insensitive\u201d, and instead chose a career in physiology. In 1950, he created a physiology department at the University of Glasgow Veterinary School, and over the next eight years built a research laboratory that housed advanced cardiovascular technology.  At Glasgow, Black became interested in the clinical problem of angina pectoris, severe chest pain caused by a shortage of oxygen to the heart. The heart responds to the body's demand for blood circulation, and when oxygen levels are low, hormones instruct it to beat faster. If the circulation is unable to keep up, the heart can become starved of oxygen and produces pain. Black argued that reducing the effects of the hormones adrenaline and noradrenaline on the heart would break the cycle by preventing the increase in heart rate. Anti-adrenaline drugs were a well-recognized group in the late 1950s, and Raymond Ahlquist had already proposed in 1948 that the widespread effects of adrenaline were mediated by two classes of receptor, \u03b1 and \u03b2. Black wanted to find a \u03b2-receptor antagonist to block the effects of adrenaline. He approached ICI Pharmaceuticals Division for a grant and they persuaded him to join them in 1958. However, Black was careful not to guarantee a new drug: \u201cAll I ever promised was that I was sure that I could develop a new pharmacological agent which might answer a physiological question. Any utility would be implicit in that answer.\u201d At ICI, Black was introduced to chemistry. Without an antagonist as a chemical lead, he had to start cold, using the selective 'agonist' isoprenaline. This activates the \u03b2-receptors, triggering a response that mimics the natural one induced by adrenaline. None of Black's isoprenaline analogues blocked the \u03b2-receptors. Then, in 1958, a publication appeared describing dichloroisoprenaline (DCI) as lowering heart rate. Strangely, in Black's bioassays DCI was as powerful a stimulant as isoprenaline. He set up other assays and was astonished to find that, depending on the tissue preparation, DCI could be a full agonist, activating the \u03b2-receptors, or an antagonist that bound to the receptors but failed to activate them. As Black stated later, \u201cas analytical pharmacologists, what we see of the properties of a new molecule is totally dependent on the bioassay we use\u201d. A simple analogue of DCI soon led to the first \u03b2-blocker, pronethalol. This proved to be only a prototype drug, and Black and his team mounted a chemistry programme to yield the drug propranolol in 1964. Today, propranolol and related drugs are widely used to control blood pressure. Yet the considerable effort required to develop such a compound and bring it to market was not intellectually challenging enough for Black, and by 1963 he was thinking about other physiological problems. Black had worked on gastric-acid secretion at Glasgow and now there was a fresh puzzle to solve \u2014 namely, the role of the hormone gastrin and histamine in stimulating gastric-acid production. If the stimulants driving gastric-acid secretion could be blocked, he postulated, then the corresponding reduction in acidity would allow patients' peptic ulcers to heal. But at this stage, it wasn't clear whether histamine was even involved as a natural stimulant. In the early 1960s, gastroenterologists were convinced that gastrin was the direct driver of gastric-acid secretion, and the pharmaceutical industry, including ICI, were set on finding a gastrin antagonist. Black had other ideas. He could see a strong analogy between histamine and adrenaline, and had no doubt that a histamine antagonist that blocked secretion could be found. In 1964, he accepted an invitation to join Smith Kline & French Laboratories to pursue this project. As before, Black started collaborating with medicinal chemists. After nearly four years of failure, he decided to reinvestigate a particular class of compound using a refined assay design. The sixth compound synthesized,  N \u03b1 -guanylhistamine, on retesting, was found to have a slight inhibitory effect on gastric-acid secretion. Here at last was a lead for the medicinal chemists. Refined into burimamide, the prototype drug proved the existence of histamine H 2  receptors and was verified as a histamine blocker in human volunteers. The chemists ultimately designed the anti-ulcer drug cimetidine, which very quickly became the world's first drug to make sales of more than US$1 billion a year. Black identified his own criteria for successful drug research: well-recognized clinical problems that could be related to physiological processes; a defined chemical starting point; and an easy way of proving that the drug would work in humans. Black's genius was to analyse pathways without resorting to wishful thinking. Jim Black was a formidable teacher. All who worked with him benefited from his enquiring mind and ability to make you question what you were trying to achieve. No scientist from a pharmaceutical-industry background has been so widely recognized. His achievements were acknowledged by his Nobel prize, his election to the Royal Society and membership of the Order of Merit. He was truly a giant. Reprints and Permissions"},

I propose to call this the 'brooding reflex' because it seems to be the mechanism whereby the newly hatched duckling orientates itself to the position of optimum warmth and mechanical protection beneath the female. It involves an active search by the duckling for a feeling of enclosure around the head or part of the head ... Thus, a duckling a few seconds after hatching on my hand would actively follow my other hand once I had held its head between finger and thumb. A state of rest, or even of sleep, could be released in the ducklings merely by providing this contact stimulus on two sides of the head or bill ... I found that I could release a similar quiescence in wild juveniles ... To date, this response has been positive in every nidifugous juvenile I have handled ...

So how can it have formed in high concentrations in one of the harshest environments on Earth, a place where attempts at finding life have failed? Writing in  Nature Geoscience , Vladimir Samarkin  et al . provide the answer: an unexpected abiotic mechanism for nitrous oxide production ( V. Samarkin  et al .  Nature Geosci.  doi:10.1038/NGEO847; 2010 ). The authors report their discovery of nitrous oxide emissions from the soil around Don Juan Pond in Antarctica (pictured), a lake that is so salty it almost never freezes, even in the cold Antarctic winter. Surprisingly, Samarkin and colleagues found that the flux of gas from the lifeless soil was comparable to that of certain tropical soils that teem with microorganisms. An abiotic process must be the source, but no such process was known.  Samarkin  et al . realized that the environment of Don Juan Pond contains chemical ingredients that might take part in reactions that produce nitrous oxide: nitrate and nitrite salts in the brine, and iron( II ) salts in the rocks around the pond's edges. Back in the laboratory, they found that nitrous oxide was indeed immediately produced when they mixed sterile brine from the pond with minerals found in the pond's vicinity, and at temperatures as low as \u221220 \u00b0C. Hydrogen gas was also produced. The newly discovered process for nitrous oxide production might well occur elsewhere on Earth. More intriguingly, the authors propose that it may also occur on Mars, which harbours minerals, brine geochemistry and sub-zero temperatures remarkably similar to those at Don Juan Pond.

Farley"}], "parsed_as_year": "2006_or_before", "body": "Builder of the world's largest radar/radio telescope. Bill Gordon, who died on 16 February at the age of 92, was a pioneer in studies of the ionized part of the upper atmosphere (the ionosphere, above about 50 kilometres). He conceived of and built a gigantic steerable radar telescope with a diameter of 300 metres, nestled among the mountains of Puerto Rico. Although this instrument was originally designed to study the ionosphere, today it is also used for radar astronomy, exploring objects as distant as a moon of Saturn and as near as potentially dangerous small asteroids. The antenna also serves as a huge telescope for radio astronomy, which, in contrast to radar astronomy, relies on radio waves emitted rather than reflected by an object. It is unsurpassed in the study of pulsars; one such study led to the discovery of the first planets outside the Solar System, and the authors of another won the 1993 Nobel Prize in Physics. In the late 1950s, Gordon was a professor of electrical engineering at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, working with Henry Booker on developing radio scatter communication links, which were used commercially in the Caribbean islands and by NATO in Europe. In 1958, Gordon came up with the idea of using radio signals backscattered from individual electrons in the ionosphere to study the 'weather' above 50 km \u2014 that is, space weather. This scatter is exceedingly weak, so studying it is rather like trying to detect a one-millimetre sphere at a range of 300 km. But Gordon showed that this might actually be done with existing 1958 radar technology using a 300-metre-diameter antenna and a megawatt or two of pulsed transmitter power. From the power and shape of the Doppler spectrum of this incoherent scatter, as it is now called, most of the properties of the ionosphere to altitudes beyond 1,000 km can be determined. Gordon had his seminal idea at a propitious time. In 1958 the cold war was at its height, and surplus military radar equipment was available for the asking, along with military funding for interesting ideas \u2014 even unclassified ones. In a remarkably short time, Gordon raised US$10 million or so (in 1960s dollars, remember), designed the radar with colleagues at Cornell and in industry, and moved to Puerto Rico for about five years with his family and four other families from Cornell to supervise the radar's construction. How do you build a 300-metre steerable radar? Steering the whole antenna is obviously impractical. Fixing the antenna's reflector and moving its feed is the only alternative, but then the reflector must be spherical, not parabolic, and with a line, not a point, focus. Designing a good feed is surprisingly difficult. But first, where do you locate the radar? You want it to be as far south as possible (so that it can observe planets as well as the ionosphere), and in a politically stable location. The karst region of Puerto Rico has ideal topography, and a natural sinkhole of about the right shape was found near the city of Arecibo. Somehow, all the necessary steel, concrete and heavy equipment were transported over the narrow, winding, rural roads to the site of the observatory. This remarkable radar was dedicated in 1963, shortly after making its first observations. It is now a US national facility operated by Cornell. At the fortieth anniversary of this dedication, the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers declared the Arecibo Observatory to be a \u201cMilestone in Electrical Engineering and Computing\u201d, and the American Society of Mechanical Engineers declared it to be a \u201cMechanical Engineering Landmark\u201d. This double award made the observatory one of the top ten engineering achievements of all time. At the ceremony, Gordon remarked: \u201cWhen we were talking about building the radar back in the late '50s, we were told by eminent authorities it couldn't be done. We were in the position of trying to do something that was impossible, and it took a lot of guts and we were young enough that we didn't know we couldn't do it.\u201d He also advised the audience: \u201cIf you dream, have big dreams, [and] talented supporters.\u201d And to graduate students he added: \u201cMay each of you experience the passion of creation as you discover something new as you do your doctoral research, and may you experience the same deep passion a few more times in your professional careers.\u201d On a lighter note, the Arecibo Observatory featured in the 1995 James Bond movie  Goldeneye  and in the 1997 movie  Contact , starring Jodie Foster, which is about the search for extraterrestrial intelligence, an activity carried out by the observatory. In 1966, Gordon moved to Rice University in Houston, Texas, where he served in various capacities, including as professor of space sciences and electrical engineering, provost and vice-president. He retired in 1986 as a Rice distinguished professor emeritus, one of only two professors to be so honoured. While at Rice he remained active in Arecibo research, especially in a programme involving heating the ionosphere with high-power radio waves. Bill received many scientific awards, and was a man of great humanity. He was superb at picking a good team and leading it effectively, as he showed in building Arecibo. He was widely sought after to chair important committees. Once, when a rather fractious group with strong opinions arrived for their first meeting, arguing heatedly, Bill, as chairman, began the meeting with: \u201cLet's make a list of those things on which we can all agree.\u201d As the list grew, the outline of the report of a committee that had reached consensus emerged. Another Gordon committee rescued a Peruvian incoherent-scatter observatory when its funding was threatened. Bill enjoyed 61 years of marriage to his first wife Elva, and is survived by their two children, four grandchildren and three great grandsons. After Elva's death, he married his long-time friend Elizabeth Bolgiano, who survives him. At a dinner with Liz and Bill in February 2009, Bill remarked to me: \u201cRemember that every day is Valentine's Day.\u201d That was Bill. He will be missed. Reprints and Permissions"},

Kim  et al . deposited the microspheres onto a film to prevent them from moving, then treated them with a compound that attached fluorine atoms to the upper, exposed surface of the spheres. Once detached from the film, the particles had two distinct faces \u2014 a hydrophilic (water-attracting), non-fluorinated side and a superhydrophobic (water-repelling), fluorinated side. The dimples on the surfaces of the spheres were essential for generating superhydrophobicity. Kim  et al . found that the Janus particles form hexagonal arrays on water surfaces, with their hydrophilic hemispheres facing the water. The resulting monolayers of particles are surprisingly robust: when the authors dropped a small amount of water onto a monolayer, it didn't pass through, but instead formed spherical droplets up to 2.4 millimetres in diameter. Larger droplets were heavy enough to force their way through the monolayer by widening the gaps between the particles. If poked with a hydrophilic glass rod, the monolayer deformed to prevent the rod from coming into direct contact with the water. What's more, when water droplets were rolled on a bed of microspheres, the droplets became coated with the particles, creating 'liquid marbles'. The marbles could be picked up and squeezed by tweezers, without bursting (pictured).  The authors speculate that their microspheres could be used to form buoys for floating micromachines, or size-dependent, semipermeable membranes at the interfaces of immiscible fluids. They might even find their way into rain-resistant cosmetics. Reprints and Permissions"},

Schrabback  et al .  Astron. Astrophys . in the press; preprint available at arXiv:0911.0053). Their study is not only one of the most comprehensive analyses of the 'weak gravitational lensing' effect that is caused by large-scale structures in this distinctive part of the sky, it also uses this effect to provide independent evidence that the Universe is indeed expanding at an increasing rate. Evidence for cosmic acceleration has been collected, for example, from analyses of stellar explosions known as type Ia supernovae and from studies of the cosmic microwave background radiation (relic radiation from the Big Bang). But when it comes to testing the Universe's dynamics and its fate, the more evidence the better. Different techniques are subject to different uncertainties, so any independent test is most welcome. So what is the gravitational lensing effect? Picture a distant object in the sky. If there is nothing between the object and an observer on Earth, the observer sees one image of the object. However, if there is a mass concentration in the foreground \u2014 the lens \u2014 the object's light is deflected by the gravity of that mass. In the strong regime of this effect, the observer sees multiple images of the background object; in the weak mode, the observer sees a subtle distortion of the object's shape. In their study, Schrabback  et al . combine space-based measurements of the image distortions of more than 400,000 galaxies in the COSMOS field with ground-based estimates of their redshifts to infer the foreground mass \u2014 mostly invisible \u2014 in this field. They find that the statistical properties of the deduced mass distribution (pictured; white, cyan and green denote distances typically closer to Earth than do orange and red) can be best explained by a cosmological model in which the Universe's expansion is accelerating.  If that isn't enough, the authors also show that the way in which the weak lensing effect changes with redshift is in accord with what is expected from Einstein's theory of general relativity. What remains to be addressed is the nature of the Universe's most bizarre component, dark energy, which is thought to be driving the cosmic acceleration. Reprints and Permissions"},

Before Joanne Simpson got into meteorology, neither women nor clouds were taken very seriously in the emerging field of atmospheric science. She liked to tell the story of a pre-eminent professor advising her that clouds would be \u201ca good subject for a little girl\u201d because they were just passive phenomena determined by the larger dynamics of the atmosphere. That little girl went on to show that clouds are essential interactive elements of the atmosphere \u2014 critical not only to the physics of major storms, but also to the general circulation and climate of the whole atmosphere. Simpson, who died on 4 March, was an explorer. She undertook treks in the Himalayas, undersea diving and long sailing expeditions. But most of all, she explored clouds \u2014 first by aircraft and later by satellite. She focused her life's work on cumulus and cumulonimbus clouds because she wanted most to understand the clouds that carry energy from the warm tropical oceans to the upper atmosphere. Simpson's early work at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Massachusetts and at the University of California, Los Angeles, in the 1950s and 1960s took her over the ocean in crude airplanes to observe how the smallest tropical cumulus clouds carried energy up from the sea. Further astute observations of tropical cloud forms led her to postulate how these clouds become diluted by drawing air into themselves from the uncloudy environment. Her work inspired some of the first numerical cloud modelling, which she later promoted in her laboratories at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the University of Virginia in Charlottesville and, finally, NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. Indeed, at NASA, she and her colleagues developed one of the most respected cloud-modelling research centres in the world today. Simpson's most famous work is her 'hot tower' hypothesis, posited with her colleague Herbert Riehl in 1958. Around this time, meteorologists were mystified by the observation that warmer, high-energy air in the upper atmosphere of the tropics seemed to be separated from the warm ocean by a region of low energy in the middle levels of the atmosphere. From their knowledge of the buoyant nature of the air inside cumulus and cumulonimbus clouds, Simpson and Riehl suggested that it was the cumulonimbus clouds that penetrated the low-energy region and carried energy to upper levels. Although the details of the mechanism by which this happens are still debated, the basic hot-tower energy-transport idea has become key to understanding the global climate.  Less widely recognized, but just as important, is Simpson's recognition that the hot towers reaching the upper atmosphere needed the 'protection' of larger, 'mesoscale' cloud systems. When weather satellites started to be used, researchers realized that these mesoscale systems were the extensive bright areas that dominated the satellite pictures taken over tropical oceans. Much later in her career, in 1992, Simpson led a flight into a mesoscale system that was evolving into a tropical storm, and so began to reveal how the larger mesoscale systems are involved in the early stages of a hurricane. In the mid-1960s to 1970s, while head of a NOAA laboratory in Coral Gables, Florida, Simpson focused on whether clouds could be artificially modified by seeding them with silver iodide. This stimulates water drops to freeze and thus release energy. Although cloud seeding has never proved feasible, Simpson's studies led to improved cloud modelling and to an understanding of how smaller clouds merge with each other to form mesoscale systems. During this time, she collaborated with Robert Simpson, then the director of the National Hurricane Center in Miami, Florida, who would become her husband of 45 years. Together, they designed an experiment called Project Stormfury, to explore whether cloud seeding could be used to mitigate the strength of hurricanes. The technology did not prove effective, but, like the Florida cumulus work, these field experiments led to new understanding \u2014 in particular, that it is difficult to reduce the strength of hurricanes by artificially seeding hurricane clouds because they are naturally filled with ice particles. Mesoscale cloud systems remained a focus for Simpson during and after the Florida years; to study them, she helped lead expeditions to the equatorial Atlantic, the Asian monsoon and the South Pacific. By the 1990s, though, Simpson had arrived at NASA and was moving away from the piecemeal study of clouds, through observations from aircraft, to the comprehensive study of tropical clouds by satellite. She became project scientist for the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) satellite, which put the first meteorological radar into space in 1997. This satellite still orbits the tropical latitudes today. It observes critical details of the entire population of clouds that release energy into the tropical atmosphere and drive the global climate. The satellite has been revolutionary \u2014 spawning global studies of rainfall and a host of other factors crucial for understanding the global climate, such as how the hot towers and other clouds of the tropics distribute energy, how monsoon rains occur, how the Himalayas and Andes affect the distribution of tropical clouds, and how anthropogenic effects are influencing weather. Simpson considered the TRMM her greatest achievement. She received numerous formal accolades and awards throughout her working life, including the  Los Angeles Times  Woman of the Year and the American Meteorological Society's 1983 Carl-Gustaf Rossby Research Medal \u2014 the highest award in atmospheric sciences, named for the very professor who told her clouds were not all that important. But she is also remembered for pushing atmospheric sciences forward by the great force of her personality and her charisma. Whether in a broad-brimmed hat or flight suit and sunglasses, Joanne Simpson at the height of her career, walking into a crowd and aligning the group towards the mission of the day \u2014 that will not be forgotten. Her powerful combination of intellect, determination, leadership and drive will be missed. Reprints and Permissions"},

But what genes \u2014 or general genome-wide differences, for that matter \u2014 mediate variations in this trait? Demetris Pillas and his colleagues set out to address this question, and others, by searching for genetic markers that affect primary-tooth development during infancy ( D. Pillas  et al .  PLoS Genet.   6 , e1000856; 2010) . The authors investigated records from two groups of subjects: one consisting of more than 4,500 individuals from northern Finland born in the mid-1960s, and the other made up of more than 1,500 individuals living in Britain and born in the early 1990s. They then performed genome-wide association studies on DNA extracted from blood samples taken from these individuals, looking for the genetic markers called single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that affect normal tooth development. SNPs in five genomic regions (loci) stood out as showing a strong association not just with a delay in the time of first-tooth eruption but also with fewer teeth at the age of one year. SNPs within another five loci also seemed to associate with these traits, albeit to a lesser extent. The SNPs in the five top-ranked loci are within or near genes that have been implicated in growth and organ development, if not directly in tooth development, suggesting that tooth development is not an isolated event but is related to other developmental processes.  The extra benefit offered by Pillas and colleagues' subject groups was that, as well as providing records of infancy, the individuals were followed into adulthood. Taking advantage of this resource, the authors investigated how their top ten SNPs correlated with dental complications later in life. One SNP, rs6504340, which is located in the  HOXB  cluster of development-regulating genes, showed a strong association with a requirement for orthodontic treatment by the age of 30. The authors point out the need for similar studies in other population groups to further establish the associations of these SNPs with tooth development. Given the link with other developmental processes, such studies might unveil connections with certain diseases in later life. Reprints and Permissions"},

Such studies require patience. Jennifer Rudgers and colleagues have spent six years investigating the relative performance of cultivars of tall fescue grass with different forms of a symbiont, and now report the results and their recommendations for the use of this versatile yet vexatious grass ( J. A. Rudgers  et al .  J. Appl. Ecol.  doi:10.1111/j.1365-2664.2010.01788.x ). Tall fescue could well be the plant that makes a lawn near you. It is also grown for forage (pictured). It is highly invasive, however, and counts as a weed in situations in which plant diversity is desirable. Like many plants, it does not live alone, and has what might be called the X factor \u2014 symbionts that in the case of tall fescue often include the fungus  Neotyphodium coenophialum . Like the grass, the fungus comes in different genotypic forms. For example, one common form (KY-31) produces alkaloids that are toxic to certain herbivores; another form (AR-542) does not.  By planting experimental plots, Rudgers  et al . set out to test, among other things, how two cultivars of the tall fescue  Lolium arundinaceum  inoculated with KY-31, AR-542 or neither, affect the plant species composition of the plots. The two cultivars chosen were Georgia-5 and Jesup. The authors' salient finding is that Georgia-5 plus AR-542 allows greatest growth of other grasses and herbaceous flowering plants, and produces fewest inflorescences (and so fewer seeds). Those characteristics would be appropriate for applications in which tall fescue has a job to do but where diversity of vegetation is the aim, for example in preventing soil erosion. There would also be reduced fescue spread from the planting site. Jesup with either symbiont is preferable for monoculture. The significance of this line of research extends well beyond the specific performance and application of tall fescue. Plant breeders are becoming ever-more imaginative in exploring the intricate options offered by different genotypic mixes of plants and symbionts. Ecologists have a big task on their hands in checking the ecosystem consequences \u2014 and in taking into account the many other conditions that affect vegetation growth and invasiveness.

Placing molecules on properly nanostructured substrates is a crucial part of the working principle of surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS), a technique that is widely used to characterize the chemical composition of a sample. This approach has been shown to boost the intensity of the molecules' vibrational Raman spectrum by factors exceeding one million 1 , and has allowed a single molecule to be detected under favourable circumstances 2 , 3 . One drawback of SERS is that the Raman signal, obtained by scattering laser light from the sample, is sufficiently strong only for molecules residing on gold or silver (or hard-to-handle metals such as lithium or sodium) substrates that have roughened surfaces or consist of arrangements of metallic nanoscale features. On  page 392  of this issue, Li  et al . 4  describe an innovative approach to SERS, termed shell-isolated nanoparticle-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SHINERS), that expands the versatility of SERS. The enhancement of the Raman signal that distinguishes SERS from other spectroscopic techniques arises from collective electron excitations called surface plasmons that form at the nanostructured substrate's surface when light strikes the sample. Such a plasmonic resonance helps to concentrate the intensity of both the incident light and the Raman radiation scattered by the sample in features such as nanometre-sized clefts and crannies in the underlying substrate 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 . Since its first demonstration more than 30 years ago 1 , SERS has become an active field of research and, along the way, has spawned the more general field of plasmonics 9 , 10  and metamaterials 11 . Li and colleagues' SHINERS technique 4  relies on coating nanoparticles with a very thin layer of an oxide, such as silica or alumina, and then spreading these nanoparticles onto a sample. For a layer of hydrogen on a single-crystal platinum surface ( Fig. 1 ), the authors were able to record intense SHINERS Raman spectra of the vibrational modes of the hydrogen at this interface. Next, and to investigate the applicability of SHINERS to non-metallic surfaces, they measured the Raman spectrum of a single-crystal silicon wafer covered with hydrogen. Finally, to demonstrate the versatility of their technique, they applied it to biological systems and food. They report seeing new vibrational bands in the Raman spectrum of yeast cells \u2014 presumably due to biomolecules that reside in the cells' surface. They also detected the potent insecticide parathion by spreading the silica-coated nanoparticles on the skin of a parathion-contaminated orange. Essentially, what Li  et al . have invented is a 'powder' with which one can dust a sample to detect and identify the molecules at its surface. Researchers have previously attempted to extend the applicability of SERS to various materials and substrate morphologies by using approaches similar to that used by the authors 4 . The late SERS pioneer Michael Weaver recorded Raman spectra from molecules adsorbed on transition metals by depositing thin layers of those metals on nanostructured gold or silver substrates, while ensuring that the thickness of the layer would not damp out the gold's strong plasmonic resonance too much 12 . Likewise, glass-coated silver and gold nanoparticles have been used broadly 13  and even commercialized. But Li and colleagues' insight of making the silica coat so thin as to increase the plasmonic influence of its golden core on the sample under investigation as much as possible, while avoiding direct contact of the sample with the core, is new and potentially powerful. And, as the authors have demonstrated, it is especially useful in revealing the Raman spectra of molecules adsorbed onto metals through the creation of a hot spot \u2014 a tiny volume in which the optical electromagnetic fields are especially concentrated \u2014 at the junction between the silica-coated nanoparticle and the adsorbate/substrate. One feature that will have to be clarified in future work is the extent to which molecules interacting nonspecifically with a substrate \u2014 as parathion molecules do with orange peel \u2014 migrate from the substrate to the silica-coated gold nanoparticles. In this situation, it would be the hot spot between neighbouring nanoparticles that produces the Raman signal, as opposed to that between the nanoparticles and the substrate. But such details will be elucidated as SHINERS is put to use in the materials and life sciences. Reprints and Permissions"},

J\u00e4nne"}], "parsed_as_year": "2006_or_before", "body": "Inhibitors of RAF enzymes can suppress or activate the same signalling pathway. The details of how this happens provide a cautionary note for those targeting the pathway for anticancer drug discovery. Over the past year, there has been considerable excitement following the positive therapeutic effects of the compound PLX4032 in early clinical trials in patients who have metastatic melanoma 1 . The compound is thought to selectively inhibit BRAF V600E , a mutant, cancer-associated form of the kinase enzyme BRAF. The positive clinical effects of PLX4032 contrast with clinical responses to inhibitors of MEK, another kinase directly downstream of BRAF in the RAS\u2013RAF\u2013MEK\u2013ERK signalling cascade. MEK inhibitors have been less effective than PLX4032 in clinical trials 2 , despite the fact that they \u2014 like the BRAF inhibitor \u2014 selectively killed melanoma cells that carry  BRAF V600E  mutations in preclinical studies 3 . But despite the antitumour effects of PLX4032 on melanomas, about 25% of patients treated with the drug unexpectedly developed hyperproliferative skin lesions (keratoacanthomas) and, in some cases, squamous-cell carcinomas, which disappeared following drug withdrawal 1 . Adding to this paradox, although most cancer-causing (oncogenic)  BRAF  mutations \u2014 such as  BRAF V600E  \u2014 enhance the kinase's activity, some patients with melanoma harbour BRAF-inactivating mutations 4 . Three studies, two in this issue 5 , 6  and another in  Cell 7 , begin to provide an explanation for these unexpected findings. All three studies 5 , 6 , 7  started with the same intriguing observation: whereas selective BRAF inhibitors potently suppress RAF\u2013MEK\u2013ERK signalling in  BRAF -mutant melanoma cells, the same inhibitors unexpectedly activate this pathway in a different type of tumour cell \u2014 those that carry an oncogenic mutation in the gene  KRAS , but which possess a wild-type  BRAF  gene ( Fig. 1 ). Heidorn  et al . 7  report that the selective BRAF inhibitor 885-A binds to wild-type BRAF in  KRAS -mutant cells and promotes the formation of BRAF\u2013CRAF complexes, in which CRAF is a RAF kinase related to BRAF in this signalling pathway. Formation of the complex activates CRAF, and consequently the MEK\u2013ERK pathway. Heidorn  et al . also demonstrate that a 'kinase-dead' mutant of BRAF (which behaves like an inhibited BRAF enzyme) similarly binds to CRAF and cooperates with a mutant form of the  RAS  gene to promote MEK\u2013ERK activation, thus inducing melanomas in genetically engineered mice ( Fig. 1 ). The authors therefore provide a unifying explanation for the oncogenic effect of kinase-dead BRAF proteins, and for the pro-tumorigenic effects of BRAF inhibitors in some settings (such as in cells that lack  BRAF -activating mutations). Hatzivassiliou and colleagues' studies 6  ( page 431 ) are thematically similar, but their focus is on working out the molecular mechanisms by which two selective, structurally unrelated BRAF inhibitors \u2014 GDC-0879 and PLX4720 \u2014 activate the RAF\u2013MEK\u2013ERK pathway in  RAS -mutant cells. The authors' findings suggest that GDC-0879 promotes the formation of dimeric complexes of RAF-type kinases, specifically BRAF\u2013CRAF, BRAF\u2013ARAF and CRAF\u2013CRAF complexes. The authors also obtained a crystal structure of a close analogue of GDC-0879 bound to CRAF. This revealed that drug binding causes a conformational change in the kinase that promotes the formation of dimeric RAF complexes. Although PLX4720 also induces activation of the RAF\u2013MEK\u2013ERK pathway, Hatzivassiliou  et al . found that it actually prevents the formation of BRAF\u2013CRAF complexes. Their models suggest that this is because the inhibitor induces a different conformational change in BRAF, which specifically impairs BRAF binding to other RAF kinases. It therefore seems that PLX4720 mediates its effects by promoting the formation of CRAF\u2013CRAF dimers ( Fig. 1 ). Poulikakos and colleagues 5  ( page 427 ) also investigated the biochemical effects of RAF inhibitors. They found that these agents activate MEK and ERK not only in tumour cells that harbour a mutant version of  RAS , but also in cells in which the RAS\u2013RAF\u2013MEK\u2013ERK pathway is activated by other oncogenes, such as  HER2 . Consistent with Hatzivassiliou and colleagues' report 6 , Poulikakos  et al . suggest that PLX4720 functions by promoting CRAF\u2013CRAF formation ( Fig. 1 ). In addition, they make the intriguing observation that, at low concentrations, compounds that are thought to inhibit all RAFs (pan-RAF inhibitors) stimulate the RAF\u2013MEK\u2013ERK pathway. Presumably this is because, at low concentrations, the inhibitors bind to only a fraction of the available RAF kinases, promoting the formation of complexes of the drug-bound kinases with non-drug-bound RAFs. Because only one kinase within a given complex is drug-bound (inhibited), such complexation induces the activation of the non-drug-bound kinase, thus promoting MEK\u2013ERK signalling. Although the precise mechanisms by which different RAF inhibitors activate the RAF\u2013MEK\u2013ERK pathway may differ, all three studies 5 , 6 , 7  demonstrate that inhibitors thought to be selective for mutant BRAF can activate CRAF through the formation of dimeric RAF complexes \u2014 a process that is enhanced by the presence of an oncogenic  RAS  mutation. Consequently, these studies support the same fundamental conclusion: mutant-specific BRAF inhibitors should be used for treating cancers caused by  BRAF  mutants (such as  BRAF V600E -associated melanomas), but should be avoided in cancers caused by  RAS  mutants (including other kinds of melanoma). This underscores the need to select patients who have  BRAF -mutant cancers for current and future clinical studies of BRAF inhibitors. These findings 5 , 6 , 7  may also help to explain the side effects of RAF inhibitors in patients with melanoma, and they raise additional therapeutic considerations. Although it remains to be formally proved, it is tempting to speculate that the keratoacanthomas and squamous-cell carcinomas observed in clinical trials 8  of RAF inhibitors are attributable to the activation of ERK signalling by one or more of the proposed mechanisms 5 , 6 , 7  ( Fig. 1 ). Consistent with this possibility, Hatzivassiliou  et al . 6  report that GDC-0879 causes hyperactivation of ERK and hyperproliferation of skin cells in mice. Moreover,  RAS  mutations are found in up to 20% of squamous-cell carcinomas.  RAS  mutations are also present 7 , 9  in a subset of actinic keratoses \u2014 thick, scaly patches of skin that sometimes precede keratoacanthomas \u2014 supporting the notion that  RAS  mutations may enhance the pro-tumorigenic side effects of RAF inhibitors in patients. Although this particular lesion is easily removed, it could be that other, less visible pre-malignant lesions associated with  RAS  mutations might be induced by RAF inhibitors, such as those in the airways of smokers. This suggests that patients treated with RAF inhibitors should be monitored carefully for side effects. Nevertheless, the success of BRAF inhibitors in patients with metastatic melanoma 1 , a group of patients who until recently had a poor prognosis, suggests that clinical development of these compounds should continue. The trio of studies 5 , 6 , 7  might also help us to understand the clinical differences observed when melanomas are treated with MEK or BRAF inhibitors, and may provide insight into which drugs should be selected to treat genetically distinct tumours. The reports suggest that BRAF inhibitors do not inhibit (and may even potentiate) ERK signalling in normal tissues, such as skin. This effect might actually provide a greater therapeutic window for anticancer treatment, allowing BRAF inhibitors to be administered at sufficient doses to fully inhibit ERK signalling in  BRAF -mutant tumours, while sparing normal tissue. In contrast, MEK inhibitors block ERK signalling in both tumour and normal tissue, so that the therapeutically acceptable doses of these compounds are limited by the side effects associated with ERK inhibition in normal tissue, such as intolerable skin rashes 2 . It is currently not known whether the greater success of PLX4032 in clinical trials, compared with MEK inhibitors, is solely the result of a greater therapeutic window, or whether this success also (or instead) stems from the selectivity of PLX4032 for BRAF V600E . The answer to this question is important for future drug development, as BRAF inhibitors that do not activate CRAF might ultimately cause side effects similar to those caused by MEK inhibitors. Thus, a compound that inhibits BRAF V600E  alone, if it is possible to develop such an agent, might ultimately be the best drug for treating  BRAF V600E -mutant melanomas. Finally, the observation 5  that pan-RAF inhibitors might also activate the RAS\u2013RAF\u2013MEK\u2013ERK pathway in  RAS -mutant cells at low concentrations may suggest that only those inhibitors that potently inhibit CRAF at clinically achievable drug concentrations should be considered as treatments for  RAS -mutant cancers. Alternatively, MEK inhibitors may be a more appropriate choice of therapeutic agent. Regardless of the agent chosen, it will probably need to be used in combination with another drug to effectively treat  RAS -mutant tumours. More fundamentally, these reports 5 , 6 , 7  suggest that, despite 25 years of intensive study, we still do not fully appreciate the complexities of the RAS\u2013RAF\u2013MEK\u2013ERK pathway. The unexpected effects (and, in some cases, lack of effects) of cancer therapies that target it underscore the value of studies aimed at garnering detailed mechanistic insight into both normal and pathogenic signalling mediated by this pathway. Such insight might ultimately lead to the development of effective new anticancer therapies. Reprints and Permissions"},

Karen Bouwman and Dana Hawley draw this conclusion from their video evidence of feeding behaviour in experiments with caged finches ( K. M. Bouwman and D. M. Hawley  Biol. Lett.  doi:10.1098/rsbl.2010.0020; 2010 ). The trap is the preference of healthy males to feed alongside finches of the same sex that are infected with the bacterium  Mycoplasma gallisepticum , so making them more vulnerable to debilitating infection by this contagious agent.  But why does this preference exist, when the expectation would be that healthy individuals would avoid their diseased fellow finches, well, like the plague? The authors' observations show that the short-term gain for healthy males, such as the fine example pictured here, is that they have less of a battle over a meal, given that infected and so weakened males are less aggressive. Bouwman and Hawley don't rule out the involvement of chemical cues in this behaviour. But they lean towards the explanation that the visible recognition of such signs of debilitation as lethargy, and the conjunctivitis produced by  M. gallisepticum  infection, is the prompt. A further curious aspect of the results is that it was males, not females, that preferred to associate with diseased individuals of the same sex at meal times. The video evidence showed that whereas healthy males were much more likely to win encounters with infected males, females showed no such edge in confrontations with infected females. There is no obvious reason why this should be so, beyond the possibility that other factors of intraspecific dominance came into play. The bigger picture, however, concerns the evolutionary trap. House-finch infection with  M. gallisepticum  emerged only recently in evolutionary terms, some nine finch generations ago. Although the bacterium has since produced seasonal epidemics in finch populations, Bouwman and Hawley's view is that the birds have not yet caught on to the full significance of the signs of disease. Rather, the males, at least, continue to interpret these 'sickness behaviours' not as warnings to keep clear, but as indications that they have simply picked a loser in contests for food. Such a misapprehension, say the authors, can only contribute to the persistence of disease epidemics among these birds. Reprints and Permissions"},

That's if you follow the instructions of Stephan Gekle and colleagues at the University of Twente in the Netherlands and the University of Seville in Spain. They report in  Physical Review Letters  that when a cavity is transiently created by dropping an object into a fluid, the airflow inside it has much in common with that in a jet engine (S. Gekle  et al .  Phys. Rev. Lett.   104 , 024501; 2010).  The authors used an experimental set-up in which a circular disc was pulled into a tank of water by a motor, breaking the liquid's surface. To visualize the airflow in the wake of the disc, they passed smoke across the surface of the water and illuminated the resulting smoke-filled cavity with laser light. A high-speed camera was used to record the smoke's movement, taking pictures at up to 15,000 frames per second. From these pictures, Gekle  et al . calculated the velocity of the smoke (and so also that of the airflow) at speeds of up to 10 metres per second. The researchers found that air is initially pulled into the expanding cavity at velocities similar to the plummeting disc's impact speed. But the walls of the cavity rapidly collapse because of water pressure, shrinking the cavity. This shrinkage reverses the direction of the airflow, ultimately causing a thin, fast air stream to surge up through the neck of the now-hourglass-shaped cavity (pictured; the diameter of the disc at the bottom of the cavity is 4 centimetres). To calculate the air velocities that would be seen at higher speeds, Gekle  et al . simulated the system mathematically. Their model incorporated equations used to describe airflow in supersonic jet engines, but with modifications that took into account the constantly changing shape of the cavities formed in their study. By combining experimental data with numerical simulations, the authors found that air can be pushed out of the cavities at supersonic speeds \u2014 even though the pressure inside the cavity is only 2% greater than atmospheric pressure.

Slack"}], "parsed_as_year": "2006_or_before", "body": "Embryonic stem cells can create copies of themselves, but can also mature into almost any type of cell in the body. Tiny gene regulators called microRNAs are now shown to have a role in directing these properties. The single-celled, fertilized embryo is the source of all the trillions of specialized cells in our bodies, and the means by which this proliferation and specialization occur has fascinated developmental biologists for centuries. Moreover, the ability to artificially force mature, differentiated cells back into this naive state (called reprogramming) has huge potential in providing tools for regenerative medicine and for increasing our understanding of development. The work described on  page 621  of this issue by Melton, Judson and Blelloch 1  indicates that small RNAs have a crucial role in stem-cell biology and therefore in future stem-cell-based therapies. The cells that form soon after fertilization \u2014 embryonic stem cells \u2014 have a remarkable ability to divide rapidly, to make copies of themselves (self-renew) and to differentiate into any type of specialized cell \u2014 a property known as pluripotency. Once cells have differentiated, they express a set of genes encoding factors that inhibit self-renewal and that seal the differentiated state. Our understanding of the nature of this switch between pluripotent and differentiated states is still rudimentary, but several important regulatory genes are known to be required for the process. Moreover, when artificially expressed in differentiated cells (for instance, skin cells), a subset of these regulatory genes, which encode proteins known as 'stemness' factors, can reprogram the cells back to the pluripotent state 2 , 3 , generating what are known as induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). In an interesting convergence of research, multiple lines of evidence point to a type of RNA, called microRNA, as an essential factor in this switch. MicroRNAs, as their name suggests, are tiny RNA molecules that are encoded in our genome. MicroRNAs are not translated into protein; their function is to regulate gene expression 4  by binding to other RNAs, particularly messenger RNAs. Binding of microRNA to mRNA inhibits mRNA translation to protein. In humans, thousands of microRNAs regulate thousands of mRNAs in a complex network. MicroRNAs were first discovered in the nematode worm  Caenorhabditis elegans , when mutations in the microRNA genes  lin-4  and  let-7  were found to result in defective stem-cell maturation 5 , 6 . Specifically, in the absence of these genes,  C. elegans  epithelial stem cells known as seam cells failed to exit from the self-renewing state and to differentiate. Further work has revealed that microRNAs are involved in almost every biological process \u2014 including development, metabolism and ageing \u2014 in all multicellular organisms 4 . Moreover, microRNAs have been identified as being involved in many human diseases, most notably cancer 7 , 8 . The  let-7  microRNA is expressed in seam cells and mammalian stem cells 9  just before the cells differentiate. Thus, it has been proposed that  let-7  is a conserved anti-stemness and pro-differentiation factor. Its mechanism of action, however, had remained elusive. Melton  et al . now demonstrate 1  that  let-7  is a key factor in inducing the differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells, and it seems to be essential for depleting the cell of several stemness factors whose encoding genes and mRNAs are enriched in  let-7  binding sites. Decreasing the amounts of these stemness factors promotes differentiation ( Fig. 1 ). In addition, the authors identify another family of microRNAs that prevents  let-7  from promoting differentiation. These findings form the basis of a model proposing that different types of microRNA have opposing effects on the fate of embryonic stem cells, one type promoting self-renewal and the other promoting differentiation. In  C. elegans , a mutation of the  lin-28  gene results in premature differentiation of stem cells 10 , indicating that the LIN-28 protein is also a stemness factor. Recent work 11 , 12 , 13 , 14 , 15  has shown that LIN-28 is an RNA-binding protein that inhibits the processing and maturation of  let-7  microRNA in both mammals and  C. elegans  (microRNAs are modified by various proteins before they become fully functional). Moreover, LIN-28 is needed for efficient iPSC production 2 . If one 'joins the dots', it's not difficult to imagine that one of the roles of LIN-28 in iPSC production may be to suppress the maturation of  let-7  microRNA 16 . The current work 1  shows that inhibition of  let-7  promotes iPSC production from mature cells, supporting this model and highlighting the importance of this microRNA in maintaining the differentiated state ( Fig. 1 ). Melton and colleagues' observations 1  raise interesting prospects for regenerative medicine. First, they suggest that transient manipulation of microRNA levels might be a preferred route for generating iPSCs. The authors' findings will also interest workers in the cancer field, in which there is growing support for an emerging hypothesis that mutant stem cells are responsible for many cancers. The work 1  surely reinforces the strategy of manipulating the amounts of such microRNAs in tumours as anticancer therapy. These smallest of RNA molecules seem to have a big future ahead.

James Prescott Joule, the nineteenth-century British physicist whose research on electricity and heat led to the first law of thermodynamics, is eponymous with Joule heating. This is the mechanism by which an electrical conductor converts electrical energy into heat. Joule heating has always been considered an inevitable loss term for the efficiency of electronic devices, except for domestic appliances such as electric heaters and cookers, which rely on it to function. Writing in  Applied Physics Letters , Niskanen  et al . 1  describe how Joule heating can be exploited to make efficient and controllable sources of sound. The idea of converting Joule heating into sound is nearly a hundred years old. It was first proposed 2  by Arnold and Crandall, who called their sound devices thermophones. But progress in turning such thermoacoustic machines into efficient sound sources has been hampered by the high thermal conductivity of the metal wires (the electrical conductors) and of the supporting structure on which the wires are hinged or laid. Under these limitations, any Joule heat produced by the metal wires would leak out and therefore not contribute to the large temperature variation in the device that is required to produce sound. Niskanen and colleagues' sound devices 1  consist of an array of parallel aluminium wires \u2014 as many as 200,000 wires in an area of a few square centimetres \u2014 suspended over a silicon substrate. The wires are clamped at their ends to aluminium crossbars using standard silicon microelectronic processing techniques. Each wire is about 200 \u03bcm long, 3\u00a0\u03bcm wide and only 30\u00a0nm thick. Using electric-power levels of 17\u00a0W, the authors demonstrate sound levels of more than 100 dB at a frequency of 20 kHz and a distance of 7\u00a0cm from these microscale sound sources. Such sound levels are impressive for thermoacoustics but considerably smaller than those obtained in conventional home and rock-concert speakers, which can blare out sound at 100 dB for 1\u00a0W of electric power to a distance of 1\u00a0m. Even so, Niskanen  et al . 1  show that their devices can reproduce music and speech. The mechanism that underlies sound production in the authors' devices 1  is, although similar in fundamental origin, unlike that of a musical instrument such as a trumpet, in which sound is produced by an air-pressure wave set up by the musician blowing into the instrument's mouthpiece. Instead, their devices \u2014 let's call them 'nanothermal trumpets' \u2014 generate sound by means of temperature variations in the air surrounding the wire array. These air-temperature variations are induced by Joule heating in the wires when electric power is applied to the device, resulting in time-dependent air-pressure variations, and hence sound. The low thermal conductivity required for the wires' support structure, which Niskanen and colleagues take advantage of in their experiment, was first achieved by Shinoda and colleagues 3 . These workers used an aluminium film on porous silicon, which had a thermal conductivity 1/168th that of crystalline silicon, to produce ultrasonic emission of frequencies up to 100 kHz. Later work by Xiao  et al . 4  showed that ultrathin films of carbon nanotubes can be used to create loudspeakers over a wide range of frequencies. All these devices 1 , 3 , 4  have similar characteristics, being dependent on power and frequency and independent of crosstalk between adjacent wires. However, because it is fabricated on a silicon wafer, Niskanen and colleagues' device will allow control and memory electronics to be integrated into it ( Fig. 1 ). It could store music on a memory chip integrated on the same wafer, direct sound waves at a desired angle using 'phased arrays' of wires, and allow sound-wave interference in a particular pattern. Progress in the field of thermoacoustics may be boosted by advances in the sister field of thermoelectrics, which seeks to use what is known as the Peltier effect to develop materials that efficiently convert heat into electricity, or vice versa. The past decade has witnessed a resurgence 5 , 6 , 7 , 8  of interest in this field. Although much of the work was aimed at reducing the thermal conductivity of semiconductors, there has also been growing interest in thermal transport in nanoscale metallic structures 9 . The thermal conductivity of ultrathin (less than 100\u00a0nm) metallic films has been predicted to be much smaller \u2014 more than a factor of five smaller for a 30-nm-thick film such as that used by Shinoda  et al . 3  and Niskanen  et al . 1  \u2014 than that of bulk structures (those thicker than about 1,000\u00a0nm). The physics underlying the use of nanoscale metallic structures for thermoacoustics is not fully understood. Niskanen and colleagues mention the possible use of miniaturized thermoelectric coolers in their devices, presumably for additional temperature control. It would be worth considering making the metallic wires themselves out of a thermoelectric material, or cooling and heating the two ends of the wires with on-chip thermoelectric devices, thereby exploiting not only Joule heating but also Peltier heating and cooling. And the successful incorporation of nanoengineered thermoelectric devices onto silicon chips 8  indicates that such devices could be used to develop thermoacoustic integrated circuits. Detailed knowledge of the thermal properties of nanoscale materials, complemented by modern techniques for fabricating materials and creating devices, will undoubtedly bolster research and development in thermoacoustics. Arnold and Crandall could hardly have imagined such achievements in the field nearly a century ago, and Niskanen and colleagues' sound source would undoubtedly have been music to James Prescott Joule's ears.

If he was after a drink, a report by Yongmei Zheng  et al . in this issue suggests that he might have missed a trick \u2014 spiders don't need to look for water because the silk fibres that they spin are highly efficient at collecting it from moist air (Y. Zheng  et al .  Nature   463 , 640\u2013643; 2010).  To uncover the water-collection mechanism, Zheng  et al . exposed silk fibres of the cribellate spider  Uloborus walckenaerius  to humid air, and monitored them with a scanning electron microscope. They observed that initial contact with water causes the hydrophilic fibres to re-structure, so that spindle-knots form periodically along the thread axis, separated by elongated joints roughly fourfold thinner. Small water droplets then condense randomly onto the spindle-knots and joints, and begin to grow as they accumulate moisture from the air. When they reach a critical size, droplets that are attached to joints move towards the nearest spindle-knots, where they coalesce to form larger water drops. This leaves the joints free to start a new cycle of water condensation and collection. Zheng  et al . found that the structure of the silk fibres is crucial for water collection. They observed that the spindle-knots are made up of randomly arranged nanofibrils and have rough surfaces, whereas the joints consist of aligned nanofibrils and have smooth surfaces. The difference in roughness causes a surface-energy gradient that drives water towards the spindle-knots. This effect is boosted by the different shapes of the knots and the joints, which cause the drops to deform differently, thereby generating surface-tension forces that also drive water drops towards the spindle-knots. A final helping hand is provided by the different orientations of the nanofibrils in the fibres: water drops move easily along joint regions where the nanofibrils are aligned, but stick to the spindle-knots where the nanofibrils are randomly orientated. The authors went on to make artificial fibres that mimicked the structure of spider silk, and found that these successfully reproduced the water-collection properties of the natural material. They speculate that their work will help in the design of fibres that could be used in devices that collect water from the atmosphere, or that remove liquid aerosols in manufacturing processes.

Milad"}], "parsed_as_year": "2006_or_before", "body": "Retrieving a memory initiates a window of vulnerability for that memory. Simple behavioural methods can modify distressing memories during this window, eliminating fear reactions to traumatic reminders. We all have memories that we would rather forget, some embarrassing and some painful. Most of us learn to cope with these memories, but this can be difficult for those suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), in which reminders of traumatic events can trigger dread and fear. One way to counteract such associations is to extinguish them with repeated exposures to traumatic reminders within a safe environment. However, because this extinction process does not eliminate the fear memory, fear reactions often return, especially during stress. An alternative approach to treating PTSD was suggested by studies 1  in rodents. These studies showed that the mere retrieval of a memory triggers a reconsolidation process, during which the memory briefly becomes labile before being re-stored. Drugs that block reconsolidation can degrade the original fear memory in animals, but it has been difficult to apply such a strategy to humans because most of these drugs are toxic. On  page 49  of this issue, Schiller  et al . 2  report that giving extinction training to humans during the reconsolidation window effectively redefines fearful memories as safe Footnote  1 . It has been known for a century that memories must undergo a consolidation process in order to be stored in the long term 3 . An exciting and more recent discovery was that retrieving a memory triggers a reconsolidation process that employs many of the molecular mechanisms used in the original consolidation. Reconsolidation has been observed for several types of memory across different species 4 , but these studies beg the question \u201cwhat is the advantage of remaking a memory multiple times?\u201d One possibility is that reconsolidation allows memories to be updated in the light of events that have occurred since the last retrieval 5 . This hypothesis was recently tested 6  by some of the authors of the present study. In rats conditioned to fear a tone paired with an electric shock, the researchers observed that extinction training conducted within 10 minutes of memory retrieval eliminated fear of the tone, and prevented the fear from returning under a variety of circumstances, even if a reminder shock was administered. Furthermore, rats in which fear memories had been extinguished within this critical window were resistant to re-learning the tone\u2013shock association. So, instead of forming a new memory of safety, extinction training given during the updating window apparently converted the existing memory of fear into one of safety. These findings 6  in rodents raised questions about human memory. Does the retrieval of fear memories in humans trigger similar updating windows in which the memories could be modified by extinction training? If so, then how specific and long lasting are the memory-editing effects of reconsolidation\u2013extinction procedures? To find out, Schiller  et al . 2  used a well established fear-conditioning protocol, in which human volunteers learned that the appearance of a visual cue (a blue square) predicts a shock to the wrist ( Fig. 1 ). The authors used the participants' skin conductance as a measure of their fear \u2014 skin conductance increases with sweating, a phenomenon exploited by lie detectors. As in rodents, humans who recalled their fear memory 10 minutes before extinction training showed no fear response when tested 24 hours later. Furthermore, their fear responses did not return even if they were given a reminder shock at the start of the test day \u2014 they reacted to the blue square as if it had never been associated with a shock. By contrast, those participants whose memories were extinguished outside the critical window exhibited high fear responses when tested 24 hours later. So are the memory-editing effects of extinction specific to the reactivated memory, or do they generalize to other memories? To address this issue, Schiller  et al . conditioned volunteers to fear two stimuli, a blue square and an orange square, but only reactivated the fear memory of the blue square in a reminder trial. The participants underwent extinction training for both stimuli and were then administered a shock. This caused a return of their fear only in response to the orange square, confirming that the memory-editing effect of the reconsolidation\u2013extinction procedure was specific to the reactivated memory. Finally, to investigate the longevity of the effect, the authors brought a sample of their volunteers back to the lab one year later, and gave them a reminder shock. Remarkably, those who had received extinction training within 10 minutes of the reminder trial the year before continued to be immune to the shock. Taken together, Schiller and colleagues' results thus show that updating windows exist in humans, that the effects of extinction training during this window are stimulus-specific, and that the effects last for an extended period not commonly observed for other experiments in this field. Schiller  et al . studied healthy volunteers, but an exciting possibility is that their findings might be useful for the treatment of anxiety disorders such as PTSD. Current therapies involve extinction-based exposure to memory cues, but because extinction training is less effective in PTSD 7 , pharmacological methods are being explored to augment fear extinction 8 , or to block fear reconsolidation 9 , 10 . The obvious advantage of Schiller and colleagues' reconsolidation\u2013extinction method is that no drugs are required, only a modification of the timing of standard exposure therapy. There are, however, several issues that need to be carefully examined with regard to the potential clinical efficacy of this approach 2 . The aversive stimulus used in the study was a mild electric shock, which might have quite distinct effects from the kind of life-threatening events that lead to PTSD. Furthermore, it is not clear whether Schiller and colleagues' method would be effective for modifying fear memories acquired months or years before extinction training, rather than in the 24-hour period of their experiments. Finally, PTSD is a complex disorder that involves symptoms such as avoidance of traumatic reminders, emotional numbing, nightmares, flashbacks and sleep disturbances. The extent to which all these symptoms depend on aversive associations that are susceptible to editing remains to be determined. Nevertheless, Schiller and colleagues' findings are an exciting development that paves the way for mechanistic studies, in both rodents and humans, to discover how memory retrieval prepares fear circuits for updating by extinction training.

It would rather seem that certain substances in the herbage of 'improved' pastures dissolve the teeth, the process being aided by the abrasive action of the plant fibre. Wear is also increased in mouths with certain undesirable anatomical characteristics which appear to be hereditary in origin.

It is a well-known fact that the birth-rate in Great Britain fell from 36 per 1000 in 1876 to 27 per 1000 in 1907. This in itself may give cause for alarm, but the most serious feature of the fall is that it has not been the same in all classes ... As it is, the lowest stratum is as prolific as before, therefore our birth-rate has become selective. The least valuable portions of the population are selected to produce a disproportionately large share of the next generation, by the action of the more valuable portions in bringing about at any rate a partial self-elimination.

With Fran\u00e7ois Hammer and colleagues' results of a comparative census of galaxy types at two different epochs in the Universe's history, they will become even busier (R. Delgado-Serrano  et al .  Astron. Astrophys.   509 , A78; 2010). In his early-twentieth-century classification scheme, Edwin Hubble categorized the galaxies seen in today's Universe into three groups according to their visual appearance: ellipticals, spirals and lenticulars (the last being an intermediate type between the first two). Odd-shaped assemblies of gas, stars and dust that don't fall into any of these categories are termed peculiars. But is the census of today's Hubble galaxies similar to that of moderately distant galaxies? The conventional view has been that it is. Surprisingly, Hammer and colleagues' scrutiny of two samples \u2014 148 galaxies selected from the Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey, seen as they were 6 billion years ago, and 116 local galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey \u2014 finds that it isn't. The authors demonstrate that, in the distant sample, the fraction of peculiar galaxies (pictured) is about five times higher than that of their present-day counterparts, and that spirals were about 2.3 times less abundant. In striking contrast, the number of ellipticals and lenticulars is essentially the same. But there's much more to Hammer and colleagues' study than counting galaxies and sorting them into classes. Their investigation suggests that many of the distant peculiar galaxies evolve to become today's spiral galaxies through gas-rich galactic collisions \u2014 a conclusion that is at odds with the belief that galaxy collisions lead to the formation of ellipticals. Such evidence needs to be taken into account in testing theories of galaxy formation and evolution. Reprints and Permissions"},

Thomas Caskey"}], "parsed_as_year": "2006_or_before", "body": "A humble, gentle and visionary giant of molecular biology. Marshall Warren Nirenberg was only 34 years old when, in August 1961, he reported his studies on the genetic code at the International Congress of Biochemistry in Moscow. For this and subsequent work he was awarded the 1968 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, together with Gobind Khorana and Robert Holley, \u201cfor their interpretation of the genetic code and its function in protein synthesis.\u201d He was the National Institutes of Health's first Nobel laureate, and achieved these discoveries by a series of brilliant biochemical approaches \u2014 thereby disproving Ed Tatem's 1958 prediction that it would take a lifetime to break the code.  His fascination with biology began early in his life. Following a family move in his youth from New York City to a Florida dairy farm, he became an expert naturalist \u2014 studying birds, catching and releasing snakes, and collecting spiders. One previously unrecognized spider species from his collection was named \u201cMarshall\u201d by the American Museum of Natural History in New York City. His fascination with nature endured for a lifetime. Nirenberg graduated in 1948 from the University of Florida in Gainesville, and obtained a PhD in carbohydrate biochemistry from the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. He first came to the National Institutes of Health in 1957, joining the laboratory of Gordon Tomkins there three years later. Although Nirenberg's bold plan to decipher the genetic code was considered \u201csuicidal\u201d by one senior scientist, Tomkins was a supporter of the endeavour. On reflection, Nirenberg himself commented that the \u201cgoal was worth the risk\u201d. Indeed it was. His research answered the central question of how the hereditary information stored in DNA is translated into cellular proteins. He developed a succession of  in vitro  biochemical assays that led to the determination of the nucleic-acid content of the cell, the finding that trinucleotide sequences (codons) define a protein's amino-acid sequence, and the discovery of 'punctuation signals' \u2014 codons that mark the beginning and end of a peptide \u2014 and of the universality of the genetic code. Each approach was simple in execution but elegant in concept. The first assay Nirenberg developed was a bacterium-based  in vitro  protein-synthesis method. Together with Heinrich Matthaei, he made the crucial discovery that RNA, rather than DNA, programmed the synthesis of proteins. This finding led to a bold shift to studying synthetic RNA polymers \u2014 composed of single, or random mixtures of, uracil, cytosine, adenine and guanine bases \u2014 as the 'messenger' RNA intermediate. And an outcome of this extraordinarily successful approach was the observation that polyuracil directed the synthesis of only polyphenylalanine. On hearing of this breakthrough \u2014 DNA to mRNA to protein \u2014 described by Nirenberg in a small session of the 1961 Moscow congress, Francis Crick asked him to repeat his presentation to the entire congress in a special session. Nobel-prizewinning biologist Harold Varmus, at the time an aspiring student of English who was travelling in Moscow, remembers the presentation as being instrumental in changing the direction of his career from literature to science. At a more general level, the public announcement of this simple  in vitro  assay for protein synthesis triggered the race to match the base content of the genetic code to each of the 20 amino acids that constitute proteins. Two technologies were, however, required to prove that the code was triplet and to determine the sequence order: an  in vitro  assay for molecules that interact with ribosomes (cellular factories for protein synthesis); and a method for generating synthetic codons to artificially recreate the process of translation. Nirenberg and Philip Leder developed a simple translation assay in which they used radioactively labelled aminoacyl transfer RNA, partially purified ribosomes and RNA codons to detect the stable translation complex. This elegant assay nonetheless required synthesis of all 64 possible codon triplets from the four bases to determine exactly which codons translate into each of the 20 amino acids. Nirenberg's laboratory synthesized the codons biochemically using an enzyme-based approach, and showed that an adenine triplet \u2014 but not a doublet \u2014 made only the tRNA for lysine and bound to the ribosome. The translation assay was also a key analytical tool for subsequent achievements by other researchers in the field (including myself); these included the chemical, rather than enzyme-based, synthesis of codons by Gobind Khorana, which led to the rapid assignment of codons by both his and Nirenberg's laboratories, the finding that a single tRNA molecule could recognize more than one codon (the wobble concept), and the demonstration that the genetic code is universal across species \u2014 the topic of Nirenberg's address at a Vatican-sponsored meeting in 2008. Moreover, deciphering the genetic code made possible the spectacular era of DNA sequencing, recombinant DNA technology and genome projects that followed. After his seminal work in molecular biology, Nirenberg redirected his research to neuroscience, investigating, among other questions, the cellular and biochemical basis of opiate addiction, and developing cellular models for the formation of the synaptic junctions between neurons. Throughout his career, Nirenberg put great emphasis on nurturing young scientists, and many of the researchers he trained are award-winning leaders in their own fields. One example is the American Chemical Society's recognition a few months back of his 'code team', nominated by Nirenberg himself. Nirenberg's character created the environment I remember while working as a research associate in his lab. He combined an engaging, but retiring, personality with scientific focus. His laboratory, although small (112 square metres), fostered collaborative and successful ideas. His unusual circadian rhythm meant late-night planning of experiments, and excitement in the laboratory about implementing them the following afternoon. He strove to develop several approaches to a single question, while always seeking simplicity and accuracy. Our papers, for example, seldom had fewer than ten drafts in the pursuit of precision and clarity. Nirenberg died from cancer on 15 January. For 41 years, Nirenberg's partner in life and science was, until her death, his first wife Perola Zaltzman. His second wife, Myrna Weissman, also shared his love of science, and her extensive family brought youth and excitement to Nirenberg's final years. Reprints and Permissions"},

But in the most widely used of these materials \u2014 zeolites and metal\u2013organic frameworks \u2014 it is difficult to control the size and geometry both of pore openings and of the pores themselves. Writing in  Nature Chemistry , Scott Mitchell and his colleagues report a solution to this problem in which the molecular building blocks used to create a porous framework are themselves ready-made pore openings ( S. G. Mitchell  et al .  Nature Chem.  doi:10.1038/nchem.581; 2010 ). The authors' building block is a polyoxometalate \u2014 a 'wheel' of metal, oxygen and phosphorus atoms that has an opening of about 1 nanometre in diameter. Six of these wheels (three of which are pictured here as red structures) self-assemble in the presence of manganese ions (small yellow spheres) to form a regularly shaped pore (multicoloured faceted structure) of about 7 nm 3  in volume. These roughly cubic units extend in three dimensions throughout the material to make a remarkably open framework. The material also incorporates potassium and lithium ions (not shown) to balance the negative charge carried by the oxide ions in the wheel. These metal ions fit into the channels and cavities of the material loosely enough that they can be replaced with other positive ions if the compound is soaked in a suitable solution. For example, Mitchell  et al . found that 35 copper( II ) ions (Cu 2+ ) could be incorporated into each pore by soaking the material in a solution of copper( II ) nitrate. None of the manganese ions in the porous material was displaced by Cu 2+  \u2014 even though both types of ion bear the same charge \u2014 leaving the framework architecture intact. The authors could easily alter the oxidation state of the linking manganese ions while they were in the framework. When they increased the oxidation state from +2 to +3, they observed a reduction in the number of charge-balancing lithium and potassium ions. These charge-balancing ions could still be replaced with Cu 2+  ions, but only by about half as many as before. The system's ion-exchange properties could be further tuned by blocking the pore openings with organic molecules. The team found that small organic molecules introduced into the material's pores can subsequently be displaced by Cu 2+  ions. But larger organic molecules that are too large to fit inside the pore framework instead interact with pore entrances, blocking the entry of Cu 2+  ions. Because a wide range of polyoxometalate wheels are available, Mitchell and colleagues' work opens the door to a variety of porous materials that have tunable properties. The authors are currently investigating the material's catalytic and ion-sensing capabilities. Reprints and Permissions"},

These fish live among mangroves and in rivers, and are renowned for their ability to bring down an insect target from overhanging foliage by spitting a stream of water at their prey, as pictured here. Shelby Temple and colleagues have investigated the visual pigments and spatial resolving power of archerfish eyes, and present the results in the context of the requirements for vision at the water\u2013air interface ( S. Temple  et al .  Proc. R. Soc. Lond. B  doi:10.1098/rspb.2010.0345; 2010 ). Using microspectrophotometry, the authors find that \u2014 as is known in other species \u2014 the pigments and spectral tuning vary between different parts of the retina (in this case, subdivided into dorsal, ventro-nasal and ventro-temporal regions). They interpret these variations in terms of the tasks the eye has to perform when operating along three visual axes; that is, three directions in which the eye might look. A simplified description of their conclusions is that the dorsal retina has maximum spectral sensitivity at 454 and 570 nanometres, a combination that Temple  et al . consider is well suited for discriminating between shades of brown, and for identifying objects beneath them. The values for the ventro-nasal retina (visual axis up and behind) are 502 nm and 620 nm. The 502-nm peak is tuned, the authors suggest, for detecting dark images against a background of bright sky, such as the silhouette of an aerial predator. The ventro-temporal retina presents peak sensitivities at 453 nm, 535 nm and 565 nm. This combination is possibly used for colour vision along the visual axis appropriate for sighting prey against a background of foliage. From video recordings, Temple  et al . conclude that this part of the retina aligns with spitting angles, and they estimate that the visual resolution allows an archerfish to tell the difference between two objects 2 mm apart at a range of 550 mm. Archerfish can be trained to spit at coloured targets. That, say Temple  et al ., makes them excellent subjects for investigating further aspects of the function of intra-retinal differences.

On 11 March, science lost an inspiring leader with the death of Leena Peltonen-Palotie, at the age of 57, following a two-year battle with bone cancer. Known to those in the field as Leena Peltonen (she was married to her close collaborator Aarno Palotie), she was a key player in human molecular genetics. This was true both in the early days of identifying the genes and mechanisms underlying rare diseases, and more recently in trying to track the causes of common inherited disorders. Peltonen left an invaluable legacy to medical genetics by authoring more than 600 papers and mentoring some 70 PhD students. But perhaps her most enduring contribution was to show how understanding the causes of genetic diseases in isolated populations can offer clues for large-scale studies that probe the risk factors linked to common diseases such as diabetes, obesity and heart disease. Peltonen completed her PhD at the University of Oulu in Finland in 1978. After postdoctoral work at Rutgers University in New Jersey, she returned to the National Public Health Institute in Helsinki, becoming a professor in 1991. In the first half of her career, Peltonen's main focus was the diseases that comprise the Finnish Disease Heritage. This is a group of about 40 rare recessive diseases \u2014 including metabolic, skin and eye disorders \u2014 that are more prevalent in Finland than anywhere else in the world. This prevalence is due to Finland's unusual demographic history: 2,000 years ago, \u201cthe edge of the inhabitable world\u201d, as Peltonen put it, was populated by relatively small groups of settlers who carried a limited set of mutations. Peltonen identified the genes and mechanisms responsible for two dozen of these diseases, and helped find the factors underlying the rest. Her work has allowed physicians around the world to screen and counsel individuals \u2014 although ironically, and to her disappointment, Finland itself still lacks a screening programme. Peltonen's vision and flamboyance, and her ability to raise and employ public awareness about the Finnish Disease Heritage, has helped to transform Finland into one of the most advanced places in the world for human medical genetics. In recognition of this, she was appointed Finnish Academy professor in 2003 and awarded the title Academician of Science in 2009. During the 1990s, the advent of powerful tools in molecular genetics enabled researchers to home in on the genetics of common diseases that cluster in families. Peltonen's team was at the forefront of this fresh wave of research, identifying an osteoarthritis gene in 1989. But as the hunt for risk factors ramped up, geneticists became engaged in a fierce debate over whether isolated inbred populations held clues to the factors responsible for common diseases. Although she was convinced that they did, Peltonen hedged her bets and stepped up her involvement in worldwide biobank studies in outbred populations, while continuing to pursue her work on isolated populations. In 2002, she united the registries for data on twins in eight European countries to form the GenomEUtwin project. This was the first integrated project to be funded by the European Union (EU), kick-starting European involvement in large-scale genetics. Her push for integration went further in 2003 when the backers of GenomEUtwin, the Canadian CARTaGENE biobank and the Estonian biobank founded P 3 G, the Public Population Project in Genomics, which unites the data of more than a dozen large biobanks worldwide. In 2007, Peltonen initiated the unification of most of the European biobanks within the overarching Biobanking and Biomolecular Resources Research Infrastructure (BBMRI). This has been a great success, and now has 52 participants and 150 associated members. Finally, based on the achievements of genome-wide association studies \u2014 which involve scanning markers in the genomes of many people to find variations associated with specific diseases \u2014 Peltonen, along with Mark McCarthy of the Wellcome Trust Centre for Human Genetics in Oxford, UK, started an EU consortium called ENGAGE in 2007. This collated genome-wide data from 100,000 individuals. As a way of connecting researchers with existing data it was hugely successful, yielding many high-profile papers in just a few months. Ultimately, Peltonen's parallel pursuit of genetic studies in isolated populations proved prescient. The enrichment of a limited set of mutations yields a simpler picture than that obtained from the larger-scale hunts for the factors underlying complex diseases. Yet some of the components unearthed from the smaller studies, such as the disrupted gene underlying osteoarthritis, have been found to be involved in complex forms of the same disorders. Peltonen's interest in complex genetics always went beyond merely mapping genes. In 2002, her team unravelled the mechanism of lactose intolerance. Then in 2004 and 2005, her group found the link between a variant of a gene called  USF1 , which causes a lipid disorder that clusters in families, and insulin resistance. She was particularly proud of these findings, as in both cases the variant genes altered regulatory functions. This suggested a fundamental mechanistic difference between the basic genetic defects typical of Mendelian disease and the more subtle regulatory alterations underlying complex disease. An outspoken voice on European science policy in Brussels and elsewhere, and a member of the European Research Council, Peltonen was also a world citizen. She received prominent international honours and alternated her career in Finland with missions abroad. She founded and led the Department of Human Genetics at the University of California, Los Angeles, during 1998\u20132002, was a visiting professor at the Broad Institute in Cambridge, Massachusetts, from 2005 and became head of human genetics at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute in Cambridge, UK, in 2007. Leena Peltonen's drive, radiance and inimitable style were as impressive as her achievements. Few will forget how attendees at a Helsinki meeting were treated to a black conference bag with white polka dots, or how this brightly dressed, chic lady could kick off her high heels and mount a chair to address the troops. Nor will they forget her fortitude as she maintained her unique blend of humour and no-nonsense attitude during her battle with cancer \u2014 continuing to lead meetings, guide students and juggle telephone conferences. It is up to us to make good on her legacy, by pursuing not only fame and fortune, but also real clinical utility. Reprints and Permissions"},

Mastrandrea"}], "parsed_as_year": "2006_or_before", "body": "A voice of reason in climate-change science and policy. Anyone who ever met Stephen Schneider won't forget the occasion. I first encountered him when I was an undergraduate at Stanford University in 1997. Minutes after I stepped into his office, curious about his work but unsure what to say to a famous climatologist, my nervousness was swept away by a deluge of information. He rapidly delivered a synthesis of climate-change science and the need for action, an amusing deconstruction of the arguments of climate-change deniers and an invitation to take his course, 'Climate modeling and theory'. Later, while making notes to try to capture all I'd learned, I realized I had met a brilliant scientist who possessed a unique talent for both explaining complex issues and encouraging others to care about them. Schneider, who died on 19 July, was a pioneer in climate-change research. He was one of the first to develop and use numerical models of the climate system to address issues such as the effects of greenhouse gases, aerosols and clouds on Earth's radiation balance. He also made an art of communicating the science; for four decades, he strove to inform the public and policy-makers about the growing and now overwhelming evidence supporting human-caused climate change. Schneider grew up on Long Island, New York. Early on, his favourite pastimes included roaming the American Museum of Natural History in New York City and gazing at the rings of Saturn through his homemade telescope. He received a Bachelor of Science degree in mechanical engineering in 1966 and a PhD in plasma physics in 1971, both from Columbia University. While at Columbia, several experiences pushed him towards the study of climate change. In 1968, the university was the stage for violent protests against the institution's affiliation with defence research organizations that supported the Vietnam War. Previously uninvolved in university politics, Schneider became a mediator between students and trustees. He learned to consider differing views and to search for common values on which solutions could be built. Then in 1970, the first Earth Day (originally created by US senator Gaylord Nelson to inspire awareness and appreciation of the environment) impressed on him the importance of climate change as an environmental and societal problem, as well as an emerging field of research. A postdoc at NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York City in 1971 gave Schneider his start. A year later, he moved to the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colorado, where he remained on the staff until 1996. In 1971, Schneider drew attention and criticism for a paper he published in  Science  with S. Ichtiaque Rasool. It suggested that the cooling effects of aerosols could dominate the warming effects of greenhouse gases. In this nascent field, findings quickly emerged that showed the effects of aerosols to be regional rather than global, and that warming effects would dominate. Schneider himself was proud that he got the \u201cwrong answer for the right reasons\u201d. His conclusions were based on the evidence and modelling tools available at the time. On re-examining the issue in the light of new evidence using new tools, he was the first to correct his earlier calculations in the literature in 1975. Much of Schneider's interdisciplinary research focused on how to model and better understand Earth's interconnected systems, including human society. He also strove to quantify the risks posed by climate change using probabilistic methods. He founded the interdisciplinary journal  Climatic Change  in 1975, which focuses on research relevant to policy, and served as editor-in-chief until his death. He strongly believed that scientists should provide policy-makers with information about the relative likelihood of possible outcomes and their consequences. In his view, policy-makers could then use this knowledge to make informed decisions about which risks are acceptable \u2014 value judgements that extend beyond the answers scientific research can provide. As he described in his 2005 book,  The Patient From Hell , Schneider applied this kind of 'risk assessment' to his own treatment options when diagnosed with mantle cell lymphoma, a disease he overcame in 2002. Schneider was deeply committed to public outreach and to training the next generation of scientists. After joining the faculty of Stanford in 1992, he championed graduate and undergraduate environmental programmes and science literacy for all students. He fought tirelessly against misinformation about climate change and what he called \u201cmediarology\u201d, the tendency of the media to portray a topic as a two-sided debate, with each side carrying equal weight. He always separated scientific facts and personal opinions, emphasizing what is well established and where uncertainties remain \u2014 and why those uncertainties do not lessen the urgency of societal action. In 1992, he was awarded a MacArthur fellowship for his ability to integrate and convey the results of climate-change research through public and classroom lectures, congressional testimonies, media appearances and his own research. He served as a scientific adviser to all eight US presidential administrations from Nixon to Obama. Among his many honours, Steve was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 2002 and was a leading contributor to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). A co-author of all four IPCC Assessment Reports, he was preparing to serve as a coordinating lead author of the chapter on 'Detection and attribution of observed impacts' for the forthcoming fifth report. Coming of age within a traditional scientific paradigm in which objectivity was considered to be compromised by outreach, Steve demonstrated that scientists can also speak as citizens. His own outreach efforts made him an extensive world traveller, and despite a packed schedule, he always found time to fit in birdwatching forays to add to his 'life list' or to sample wine from a nearby vineyard with his wife and frequent scientific collaborator Terry Root. The importance of living life with purpose and passion is a legacy he leaves to all who knew him. Reprints and Permissions"},

A cross-disciplinary group of researchers led by Marcus Roper and Agnese Seminara have now brought twenty-first-century approaches, including algorithms used to model the behaviour of droplets in clouds, to bear on study of this phenomenon  (M. Roper  et al .  Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA  doi:10.1073pnas.1003577107; 2010 ). They find that simultaneous discharge in itself creates an air flow, a cooperatively generated wind, that allows the spores to travel much farther than if ejected alone \u2014 so enhancing their prospects of wafting farther afield. Roper, Seminara and colleagues used a combination of simulations, analytical models and experiments to investigate spore release from species of ascomycetes, in which spores develop in sacs (asci) in a cup-shaped structure called the apothecium. Their subjects included species of  Sclerotinia  (a plant pathogen) and  Ascobolus  (a dung fungus). Spores of  Sclerotinia , for example, have to rise from the fruiting body on the ground to infect plant flowers. In experiments, confirmed by simulations, spores riding a cooperative wind behaved much like \u201cfrictionless projectiles\u201d. They travelled 10 centimetres or more, with the range probably being limited by gravity, compared with the 3 millimetres of those ejected on their own, which are soon halted by viscous drag. Moreover, if the cooperative spore plume hit an obstacle (which in experiments was mimicked by a glass slide, but in a natural setting might be a leaf), pressure differences in the plume resulted in spore movement around it.  The authors also used high-speed imaging to see how spore release is coordinated, and looked at various apothecial species. Their data show that the process is self-organized. In  Ascobolus , the process of ejection is initiated in a few asci, perhaps by a highly local change in air pressure. A wave of spore discharge across the apothecium then ensues, possibly driven by an alteration in elastic stress, that may arise from changes in the turgor pressure of cells that are interspersed among the asci. As well as the practical aspect of providing insight into the dispersal dynamics of a plant pathogen (the species studied,  Sclerotinia sclerotiorum , infects and damages many different crops), there is another angle to this line of research. The authors point out that synchronized spore discharge might catch the fancy of biologists interested in the evolution of self-organized cooperative behaviour. Reprints and Permissions"},

By R. Harr\u00e9 \u2014 This is a very welcome book. It should be said at the outset that the author's intention to write largely for undergraduates in science may prove a little on the modest side, since many students working for higher degrees would probably produce substantially better theses if they could find time to read what Dr. Harr\u00e9 has to relate ... The grand point is that \u2014 from the aspect of discovery \u2014 disciplined insight came first, and the application of mathematical analysis afterwards. Essential as the latter is, momentous advances usually begin with remarkably simple premises. Incidentally, Max Planck is known to have fought long and hard in his mind against the consequences of his own quantum concept. The statistical and indiscriminate nature of much of modern physics was not to his liking. But that is the penalty of greatness. Questions like these are ably handled by Dr. Harr\u00e9, and the moral is driven home. \n               From  \n               Nature \n                8 October 1960 \n             \n               100 Years Ago \n             Beet Sugar Making and its Chemical Control . By Y. Nikaido \u2014 In principle, the production of sugar from beetroots is a simple matter. The sugar and other soluble bodies are extracted from the sliced roots by diffusion in water; the juice thus obtained is purified from acids and other objectionable matter by \u201cdefecation\u201d with lime, and after the excess of lime has been removed by treatment with carbonic acid, the liquor is concentrated by evaporation until the sugar crystallises out. Whilst, however, there is nothing complicated about the principle, successful and profitable production depends upon close attention to a number of points in respect of which the chemist's help is needed. \n               From  \n               Nature \n                6 October 1910 \n             Reprints and Permissions"},

Soon, very gently, the haze thinned away; the northern sun shimmered again over the smooth olive sea, burnishing the floes into silver; and then, gradually, an exquisite panorama of peaks and glaciers was unveiled in front of us ... and we knew that this was Spits-bergen, and worthy of its name. \n               From  \n               Nature \n                1 December 1910 \n             Reprints and Permissions"},
