By Sir MacFarlane Burnet \u2014 It is a pleasure to review this, the third edition, of such a well-known work, which now presents an up-to-date account of the ramifications of an important subject ... Throughout it adopts a Darwinian attitude, often overstepping the realms of human pathology into all kinds of unexpected avenues ... In its ambit it presents a picture of the ravages by bacteria, protozoa and viruses ... He discredits the practical value of antityphoid inoculation and would rather attribute the favourable results obtained to military sanitation ... The readers will find here important information about such diverse subjects as myxomatosis in rabbits, the common cold, plague, German measles, poliomyelitis, the sweating sickness of the Middle Ages and Q. fever (from personal experience). An epilogue on new diseases and the rather bleak outlook for the future finds the author in a gloomy mood in an appraisal of bacteriological warfare. \n               From  \n               Nature \n                8 December 1962 \n             \n               100 Years Ago \n             Mr. E. G. Bryant ... asks a question regarding the effect of moonlight in \u201cturning\u201d fish. I have lived many years in South Africa, and have encountered the same belief, that moonlight will hasten the turning bad of fish ... It seems curious, at first sight, that moonlight, which has so little effect on meteorological instruments, should have this effect on fish. I have thought it probably due to insects or some low form of life which would be abroad, or be stimulated to action, on moonlit nights and not on dark nights. The action of moonlight in stimulating the rise of sap in trees is widely believed in by practical wood cutters in almost every quarter of the world. \n               From  \n               Nature \n                5 December 1912 \n             Reprints and Permissions"},

Serge Haroche and David J. Wineland have been awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for developing techniques to measure and manipulate single particles without destroying their quantum properties. Haroche traps photons and measures and controls their quantum states with atoms. Conversely, Wineland traps ions and controls them with light (see  Fig. 1 ). \n                 by Ed Hinds \n               Serge Haroche and his colleagues have developed an experiment to study the quantum mechanics of microwave light trapped between two mirrors (a cavity) 1 . They show that the quantum of light \u2014 the photon \u2014 can be controlled at an astonishing l evel of precision, and have used this to bring the abstract ideas of quantum entanglement to life in the laboratory. Light is usually detected by destroying it: for example, a light sensor called a photodiode generates an electrical pulse when it absorbs, and so destroys, a photon. But Haroche's group measures the intensity of trapped light using a non-destructive method that probes the light using atoms flying through the trap. Each atom acts as a clock whose ticking rate depends on its energy level. As an atom flies through the cavity, its energies are shifted by the trapped light, and the total number of ticks of the clock changes accordingly, without any light being absorbed. When a kind of excited atom called a Rydberg atom is used, the technique is sensitive enough to detect a single photon, and repeated measurements allow the same photon to be observed as it lives and eventually dies in the cavity 2 . Similarly, starting with several photons, the researchers can watch the photons disappearing one by one as they are absorbed by the cavity mirrors. The group has even prepared photons in a 'Schr\u00f6dinger's cat' state \u2014 a fragile quantum state in which many photons are collectively doing two things at once (being dead and alive in the case of the cat) \u2014 to study how the state is destroyed by photon loss in the cavity 3 . These studies allow deep insight into the way quantum systems work, and provide a practical basis for developing powerful devices based on the strange laws of quantum mechanics. \n                 by Rainer Blatt \n               A consummate experimentalist, David Wineland pioneered the use of electromagnetic devices known as Paul traps to hold single trapped ions for quantum metrology. Along the way, he has developed a plethora of groundbreaking experimental methods that have since become standard means of manipulating single atoms. Armed with efficient single-atom detection through a technique called electron shelving, together with laser cooling to bring an ion to its lowest-energy vibrational state, Wineland masterfully conducted ultra-high-precision spectroscopy of single ions. Using precisely timed and tuned laser pulses, he tailored the coupling between the ions' internal states and their quantized vibration 4 . Notably, it is with this technology that he laid the groundwork for unprecedented control of a single trapped particle's electronic and motional degrees of freedom, which he in turn applied to generate many kinds of non-classical states that could otherwise be observed only through light\u2013matter interactions in a cavity 5 . These methods culminated in Wineland's quantum-logic clock, in which the ions' motion is used to transfer otherwise inaccessible spectroscopic information to a read-out ion 6 . This technology has produced the most precise measurement of an atomic frequency ever obtained, with a fractional uncertainty of less than 10 \u221217 . Moreover, Wineland's spectacular quantum mastery will continue to have a major impact. His techniques are already a crucial element of the exciting field of quantum information processing, and will prove invaluable for both fundamental tests of quantum physics and future quantum technologies.

It now seems that there is less universality in such absorption across galaxies than expected. One of the main tools for studying how galaxies form and evolve is to measure the rate at which massive stars are born in galaxies per unit volume of the Universe. However, some of the light emitted by stars in galaxies, especially light at ultraviolet and visible wavelengths, can be absorbed by dust (grains of silicon and carbon up to a few hundred micrometres in size) that is present in the galaxies. This absorption means that the rate at which massive stars are forming cannot be measured accurately. One way to solve this problem is to observe galaxies at longer wavelengths \u2014 the infrared regime \u2014 where the dust grains re-radiate the light. The ultraviolet and infrared data can then be combined for each galaxy to account completely for the emission produced by the stars. However, infrared data are not usually available for large samples of distant galaxies. Thus, a second approach is to try to apply a dust correction to the data. Writing in  Astronomy & Astrophysics , Buat  et al . 1  have attempted to determine how best to do this for a large sample of distant galaxies, at least in a statistical way. Deciding what wavelength-dependent dust corrections to apply to galaxies is a classic problem. Even for nearby galaxies, it is uncertain 2 , 3 , 4  whether there is a 'bump' in the dust extinction curve at 217.5 nanometres, which may relate to the grain size distribution or composition; an extinction curve describes how the dust absorption changes with wavelength. Extinction curves along sight lines towards stars in the Milky Way show a strong bump at this wavelength. However, the bump is weaker towards stars in galaxies of the neighbouring Large and Small Magellanic Clouds. At higher redshifts, there is evidence 5 , 6 for the presence of such a bump in at least some galaxies, but the extinction curve of a local 'starburst' galaxy 7 , which does not display a bump, is usually adopted in correcting for dust absorption in distant galaxies. (Redshift is what is measured directly by spectroscopy. Because of the Universe's expansion, the light from distant sources has been stretched, shifting the wavelengths towards the red end of the spectrum. The more the light is shifted to the red, the farther away, and thus the older, the source is.) Fortunately, the many new observations obtained for the distant Universe \u2014 including far-infrared data from the Herschel Space Telescope, mid-infrared data from the Spitzer Space Telescope and optical-to-near-infrared data from ground-based telescopes \u2014 have made it possible to study dust absorption at high redshift. Buat  et al . used all of these data to study the dependence of dust absorption on a variety of global galaxy properties, such as observed luminosity, stellar mass and the slope of the spectrum in the ultraviolet, for a large sample of galaxies with redshifts in the range 0.95\u20132.2. At these redshifts, optical observations sample the stars' emission of ultraviolet light \u2014 the wavelength regime at which massive stars emit most of their light and suffer the most absorption by dust. Buat and colleagues used a detailed computer code 8  that derives properties of galaxies by fitting the light emission predicted from the computations to observations made across the wavelength spectrum. They concluded that the inclusion of infrared data improved the determination of dust-absorption parameters. Interestingly, they found a wide range of values for these parameters, which they postulate could be due to the large variations in the extinction curves for galaxies. They infer that a constant extinction curve for all galaxies at all redshifts cannot be assumed, and that variations should be allowed for when computing the amount of reprocessed ultraviolet light. The authors' finding that infrared data are crucial for studies of the effects of absorption by dust in individual galaxies makes sense \u2014 previous work has shown how notoriously difficult it is to predict far-infrared emission from observed ultraviolet emission 9 . The study's goal was to find dependences of the dust-absorption parameters on global galaxy properties, which Buat  et al . hoped to use to correct large samples of galaxies in a statistical way. Although they did identify some trends, there is large scatter about the averages of the parameters that needs to be further understood. This serves as a reminder that if the galaxy property one is trying to calculate is strongly dependent on an assumed dust extinction curve, then one should be cautious about the result. Studies such as this are essential for determining the reliability of dust-absorption corrections. These corrections are pivotal in determining the extent to which massive star formation in galaxies is hidden from optical view. Correspondence to\n                 Amy Barger .

The devices may turn out to be competitors to their conventional analogues.  See Letter    p.234 Electronic displays are almost ubiquitous, not least because they are the means by which people interact with the Internet. The mobile display market has seen tremendous growth 1 , for example, with more than 1 billion mobile phones being sold in 2006. Liquid-crystal displays are a dominant technology for display applications, but organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) have steadily been incorporated into mobile devices and are increasingly being used in televisions. On  page 234  of this issue, Uoyama  et al . 2  report a type of OLED that may offer an alternative to its conventional equivalents. One of the unique features of an OLED display is that every pixel has an OLED, which is essentially a micrometre-sized light source. The millions of red, green and blue OLEDs in a display all have to be efficient, manufacturable with good yields and capable of providing a highly consistent light output. These requirements have been achieved by improving the organic materials used in OLEDs. One of the key drivers of OLED technology is novel chemistry. New molecules constantly offer surprises that challenge conventional wisdom and offer alternative solutions. Tang and colleagues 3  introduced the world to modern OLED designs 25 years ago. However, the devices were poor at converting input electric current to light because they incorporated inefficient fluorescent organic materials. Then, in 1998, a team led by Forrest (a physicist) and Thompson (a chemist) introduced 4  devices with phosphorescent molecules that enabled almost 100% efficient conversion. Phosphorescent molecules differ from their fluorescent analogues in that they contain a heavy metal atom such as iridium. This work led to an explosion of phosphorescent materials that enabled many desirable characteristics, such as a variety of colours, long operational lifetimes and high efficiencies. However, it remains difficult to produce a single display that uses blue, green and red phosphorescent devices, because the operational lifetimes and colour characteristics of some phosphorescent devices do not meet the strict performance requirements for display applications. It is important to solve these problems because phosphorescent materials are the most promising materials for displays, with the potential to deliver nearly 100% efficiency. Now, Uoyama  et al . describe how they have made efficient OLEDs that use a special type of fluorescent material. When an organic molecule absorbs electrical energy, it moves from its original state to a higher-energy (excited) state. For high-efficiency devices, the excited molecule preferably sheds the extra energy by producing a photon of light when it returns to its original, unexcited state. The molecular transition from excited to unexcited states has a few strict rules related to quantum-mechanical conditions that must be satisfied. These rules prevent every excited molecule from emitting a photon and returning to an unexcited state. As a result, fluorescent materials used in OLEDs often generate heat instead of light. Phosphorescent materials break those rules by using a heavy metal atom, such as iridium, bonded to the organic materials (typically comprising carbon, nitrogen and hydrogen) in an individual molecule. This makes it significantly more likely that after absorbing electrical energy, a phosphorescent molecule can efficiently transition from a high energy state to a low one by emitting a photon. Uoyama and colleagues developed fluorescent molecules that can achieve high efficiency by using heat instead of a heavy metal atom. They convincingly demonstrated the molecules' potential by making highly efficient fluorescent OLEDs with a performance comparable to that of phosphorescent OLEDs. Their fluorescent molecules are based on carbazolyl dicyanobenzene and as such have the potential to be synthesized at low cost, Uoyama  et al . believe, because the synthetic process does not require rare metal catalysts or rare heavy metal atoms. Furthermore, the OLEDs can emit multiple colours, from sky-blue (with a peak wavelength at 473 nanometres) to orange (577 nm). There are many challenges ahead before these molecules can be fully accepted into production. The emissive colours have to be developed for display applications; the operational lifetime of devices that incorporate the molecules needs to be comparable to, or preferably better than, state-of-the-art devices (possibly the hardest challenge); and the ability to manufacture products based on the new OLEDs must be proven. The molecules are not certain to replace existing ones, but they may be shaped into contenders in terms of the cost and quality of desirable performance characteristics. Indeed, perfecting the new molecules will take time and effort, but Chihaya Adachi, who leads the work and is a co-author of the study 2 , has the experience needed to help his team to overcome these obstacles.

Unfortunately for him, the effects of polar lows are not usually included in climate and seasonal forecasting models. Writing in  Nature Geoscience , Condron and Renfrew report that they should be (A. Condron and I. A. Renfrew  Nature Geosci.   http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/ngeo1661 ; 2012). Polar lows are typically too small (less than 250 kilometres in diameter) and fleeting (24\u201348 hours in duration) to be well resolved in global meteorological and climate models. Nevertheless, their intensity is often high enough to affect convection in the underlying ocean. Deep open-ocean convection is one of the mechanisms that renews the North Atlantic Deep Water, the main water mass that drives large-scale ocean circulation in the Atlantic Ocean.  Condron and Renfrew used state-of-the-art computational models to simulate circulation in the northeast Atlantic during 1978\u201398, in the presence or absence of polar lows. They found that models that incorporated the effects of the storms indicated more open-ocean convection, at greater depths, than those that omitted polar lows. Furthermore, the strengths of two gyres \u2014 large systems of rotating ocean currents \u2014 in the region were more frequently high when the effects of polar lows were simulated. This in turn increased the renewal of deep water in the Greenland Sea, the transport of that water flowing south across the Greenland\u2013Iceland\u2013Scotland ocean ridge, and the northward movement of heat to Europe and North America. The authors conclude that the effects of polar lows should be incorporated in ocean, climate and seasonal forecasting models. They also point out that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change predicts that these storms will shift northwards in the future, and will occur less frequently than now. If so, this could greatly affect the deep waters of the North Atlantic, potentially reducing their southward flow. Reprints and Permissions"},

Gurdon and Shinya Yamanaka, whose research \u2014 spanning more than four decades \u2014 showed that differentiated adult cells can be reprogrammed to become immature cells capable of developing into all the cell types of an organism (see  Fig. 1 ). \n                 by Janet Rossant \n               Even though the cloned animals John Gurdon produced were only tadpoles, the publication of his experiments 1  caused a media stir: the production of armies of identical cloned humans seemed to be moving from science fiction towards science fact. But it took decades before cloning was achieved in mammals. Ian Wilmut and colleagues' 1997 creation of Dolly 2  \u2014 a sheep generated by transfer of an adult cell nucleus into an oocyte \u2014 opened up practical applications for cloning. This technology has been key to the generation of genetically modified pigs, sheep and cows, and cloned animals have been used to make pharmaceutical products in milk, to generate rejection-resistant pigs for organ transplantation into humans, and as preclinical models of human disease. But it has also caused controversy: the spectre of human cloning still looms large in the public eye, despite the absence of any evidence that nuclear transfer from adult human cells could ever be effective or safe. Nonetheless, a specialized form of nuclear transfer, in which the nucleus from an egg containing faulty mitochondria in its cytoplasm is transferred to the healthy cytoplasm of another egg 3 , has the potential to treat mitochondrial disease and is being developed for use in humans. From frogs to sheep to humans, the impact of Gurdon's experiments continues to challenge nature and to break boundaries. \n                 by Christine Mummery \n               Yamanaka and his co-author 4  showed that induced pluri-potent stem (iPS) cells, which can form any kind of differentiated cell, can be derived from anyone. These cells are genetically identical to the person from whom they are obtained. So, once the technical hurdles are overcome, differentiated cells derived from iPS cells could be transplanted back into a patient without being rejected, to replace cells that have been damaged or lost through disease or trauma. These cells are also fantastic disease models. In other words, the iPS cells can essentially become 'the patient'. They may carry the same disease-causing mutations present in a patient, or have genetic variants associated with predisposition (or resistance) to a disease. Once the iPS cells differentiate to form the cell types associated with the illness, the effects of these genetic variants may reveal the underlying causes of its symptoms. Moreover, researchers might discover how a disease develops and look for ways to slow this down or even reverse it. Looking ahead, such insights might reveal windows of opportunity for treating the condition before symptoms appear. Generating patient-specific cells from iPS cells is an exciting development for the pharmaceutical industry too. Reagents that restore gene or protein expression to normal levels in its derived cells may form the basis of therapies for disorders for which there is no treatment. Similarly, these cell models should help to identify drug targets or reveal side effects of medications. Moreover, they could recapitulate human diseases for which there are no good animal models, such as heart failure and some forms of muscular dystrophy. Because iPS cells can be derived from individuals of any ethnic background, they may eventually reveal why some conditions affect certain races more than others, why some drugs are preferentially toxic to some people and why patients may not respond to certain treatments. The potential of iPS cells is almost limitless, and there are exhilarating times ahead. Correspondence to\n                 Janet Rossant  or  Christine Mummery . Reprints and Permissions"},

The Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded to Robert J. Lefkowitz and Brian K. Kobilka for their work in characterizing G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) \u2014 the proteins that enable cells to sense and respond to their environment (see  Fig. 1 ). \n                 by Bryan L. Roth \n               The idea that drugs exert their effects through specific interactions with receptors has captivated scientists' imagination 1  since 1905. But it was not until 1986 that Lefkowitz, Kobilka and colleagues' cloning of \u03b2-adrenergic receptors, which mediate the effects of adrenaline and noradrenaline, provided the first definitive proof that receptors are physical entities encoded by the human genome. This finding ushered in one of the most exciting eras of pharmacology and biochemistry, because it allowed other GPCRs to be identified on the basis of their similar transmembrane-domain architecture. Perhaps as many as 900 human GPCRs have been discovered in this way 2 . The identification of these GPCRs has revealed that more than 50% are 'orphan' receptors 3 , 4  \u2014 those for which ligands have not been identified. Working out the function of even one orphan GPCR, as Kobilka, Lefkowitz and co-workers did for the 5-HT 1A  receptor 5  (the most abundant of the receptors that bind the signalling molecule serotonin), is a great achievement and can open up entire fields of research. 'De-orphanizing' such GPCRs represents a major challenge for scientists. Lefkowitz and colleagues also discovered that GPCRs have two signalling modes: one that acts through G proteins and another facilitated by cell-scaffolding proteins such as \u03b2-arrestins 6 . It seems that \u03b2-arrestin-facilitated signalling is responsible for many of the physiological effects of GPCR activation, although the full panoply of events mediated by \u03b2-arrestins is unknown. Elucidation of the molecular basis of these effects should reveal the full repertoire of \u03b2-arrestin-mediated signalling and provide ample opportunities for drug-discovery programmes for years to come. \n                 by Fiona H. Marshall \n               For many years, pharmaceutical companies screened for drugs that act at GPCRs by using live animal tissues suspended in baths to test chemicals related to natural hormones. The introduction of assays based on radio-labelled ligands, such as those developed by Lefkowitz, was a breakthrough, because it allowed larger numbers of compounds to be tested, together with accurate measurement of their affinities for their receptors. This allowed medicinal chemists to identify the relationships between the molecular structure of a ligand and its biological activity. Lefkowitz, Kobilka and colleagues' cloning of GPCR genes had two notable effects on drug discovery. It enabled the high-throughput screening of libraries of millions of compounds against human receptors, and led to the identification of many GPCRs. A range of genomic technologies has since been applied to discover the function of these orphan receptors, and drugs that target them \u2014 for example, suvorexant, a treatment for insomnia 7  \u2014 are now approaching the market. Despite some successes, high-throughput screening is a hit-and-miss process. The availability of X-ray structures of GPCRs instigated a new era of rational design 8  for drug discovery that targets these receptors \u2014 compounds that fit perfectly into 'pockets' of the receptors can now be selected using computational techniques. Kobilka and colleagues' recently reported structure of the active form of a GPCR in complex with its signalling protein suggests that drugs that activate the receptor, rather than just block it, can also be designed. GPCR-targeting drugs discovered using such structure-based techniques are already in development. Correspondence to\n                 Bryan L. Roth  or  Fiona H. Marshall .

Yet some 170 years after their first use in medicine, the way in which these drugs exert their hypnotic effects remains a mystery. Writing in  Current Biology , Moore  et al . shed light on the question (J. T. Moore  et al .  Curr. Biol.   http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2012.08.042 ; 2012). Many biological molecules are sensitive to anaesthetics, among them membrane ion-channel proteins. To make matters more complex, there are dozens of anaesthetic agents, and yet they don't seem to share a single molecular target. An emerging theory is that these drugs inhibit the neural circuitry associated with wakefulness. Moore and colleagues asked whether they also affect sleep-promoting neurons. The authors focused on the anaesthetic agent isoflurane and its effects on the ventrolateral preoptic nucleus (VLPO) \u2014 a key component of the arousal (wakefulness) neurocircuitry. Neurons of the VLPO are active during sleep and, in response to inhibitory neuromodulators such as GABA, they inhibit signalling by downstream arousal-promoting neurons. Moore  et al . find that concentrations of isoflurane that induce sedation or anaesthetic hypnosis also activate VLPO neurons, just like sleep does. Moreover, damaging these neurons reduces the hypnotic effects of isoflurane. Of the two neuronal subpopulations that form the VLPO, only one is thought to be involved in promoting sleep. By studying slices of mouse hypothalamus \u2014 the brain region in which VLPO neurons are found \u2014 Moore and colleagues show that isoflurane specifically activates the sleep-promoting subpopulation. Exactly how it does so is unknown, but the researchers' data indicate that a reduction in the conductance of potassium ions is involved. The authors do not rule out a role for other sleep-promoting neuronal circuits in mediating the effects of anaesthetics. But their take-home message is that, to understand how anaesthetics act, studying sleep induction is probably just as useful as investigating the inhibition of wakefulness.

Glidden"}], "parsed_as_year": "2006_or_before", "body": "A genetic analysis of viruses infecting participants in an HIV vaccine trial indicates that the vaccine is more protective against viruses that have variations at specific sites in the viral envelope.  See Letter    p.417 The past five years have brought stunning progress in the development of biomedical approaches to preventing HIV infection. But despite recent hope for an AIDS-free generation, we still lack a crucial tool needed to reach this goal \u2014 an HIV vaccine. However, on  page 417  of this issue, Rolland  et al . 1  present an analysis of a clinical trial that encourages us to believe that this goal is achievable. Furthermore, their work identifies a site on the virus's outer coat as a key target for future vaccine development. Until a few years ago, the handful of candidate HIV vaccines that had been evaluated in randomized clinical trials had all failed to prevent HIV infections any better than a placebo. But in 2009, researchers conducting a trial in 16,402 volunteers in Thailand reported 2  a 31% reduction in HIV infections in recipients of a vaccine known as RV144. The study's results were met with a range of responses, from cautious optimism to outright scepticism 3 . Although RV144 had some efficiency, this was modest. For example, the credible range for protection from infection elicited by the vaccine ran between 1% and 51% \u2014 a very wide range, and negligible at its low end. In addition, sensitivity analyses of the trial results failed to cross the threshold of statistical significance, and some experts openly speculated that the outcome was a statistical fluke. A recent review 4  that formally combined the trial's findings and expert opinion estimated at least a 22% chance that the reported outcome was a false positive. In fact, doubts about RV144 had been expressed even before the study started 5 . The concerns stemmed from the fact that RV144 is a 'prime and boost' vaccine composed of two vaccines that had both shown only modest to no efficacy in previous studies. A trial of RV144 had been contemplated but scrubbed by the US-based HIV Vaccine Trials Network, and some informed observers had called for the Thai trial to be cancelled as well 5 . Despite this, it went ahead, and in the intervening three years, follow-up analyses of immune responses 6  and now, from Rolland and colleagues, of HIV infections in the trial participants, are supporting an interpretation that RV144 was indeed successful at stimulating protective immunity in some of the vaccinated individuals. Several candidate HIV vaccines, including RV144, contain proteins that belong to the outer coat or 'envelope' of HIV, with the intention of inducing protective immune memory against this region of the virus. However, the amino-acid sequence of the envelope varies among different circulating HIV viruses, so that any single vaccine based on this structure may not stimulate immune recognition across all HIV variants. Rolland  et al . examined the sequences of the envelope protein of HIV viruses isolated from people who became infected during the trial, to deduce the effectiveness of the vaccine against different viruses. In principle, if the vaccine has no effect on a particular virus type, then that virus should be found in roughly equal proportions in infected people who had received the vaccine and in those given the placebo. The researchers focused their typing on the V1/V2 loop structure of the viral envelope protein, a region previously implicated as being important for immune protection by a study showing that immune responses involving antibodies against V1 and V2 are associated with reduced risk of HIV infection 6 . Preliminary work identified 15 sites along the V1/V2 loop as specific targets of these putative protective antibodies, and Rolland and colleagues made these sites the subject of their sequence analysis. The authors found two 'genetic signatures' in the V2 region \u2014 an amino-acid match between virus and vaccine at position K169 (lysine) and a mismatch at position I181 (isoleucine in the vaccine sequence) \u2014 that were proportionally less common in viruses that had infected vaccinated individuals compared with recipients of the placebo. This suggests that the vaccine blocked or 'sieved out' viruses with these sequence features, although this effect was variable: the vaccine had 48% efficacy at preventing infection with viruses matching at K169 and 78% efficacy against viruses with a mismatch at I181. This differential effect of the RV144 vaccine in regard to HIV type is compelling, if indirect, evidence that the vaccine elicited immune responses that protected some people against some variants of HIV. Furthermore, because both sites are on the V2 region, the findings implicate this sequence as a key target for future vaccine development. In other respects, however, the results defy a simple narrative. First, in the case of the K169 position, the vaccine protects best against viruses with the same sequence as that in the vaccine. Given that a vaccine is expected to 'train' the immune system, this result is unsurprising. However, the opposite is the case for position I181, and the reason for this is unclear. It is not that the vaccine promoted infection with viruses that matched it at I181; the rate of infection with such variants was still lower in vaccine recipients than in people receiving the placebo. It is possible, however, that I181 is merely a proxy for another, unidentified, location on V2 that does indeed match between the vaccine and these viruses. Second, the results do not square neatly with the recent finding that the presence of antibodies against V1 and V2 was correlated with a reduced risk of HIV infection in those receiving the vaccine 6 . This association seems to be similar for vaccine-matching and non-matching viruses, but if it is the antibodies that provide the 'sieve' effect reported by Rolland and colleagues, one would expect them to be less protective against strains for which the vaccine was less effective. So although the sieve and correlates-of-protection analyses are both compelling, these two pieces of the story do not fully explain each other. Although such questions remain open, Rolland and colleagues' study is another demonstration of the indispensable role of randomized trials in the incremental process of HIV vaccine development. The authors' research exemplifies how data from such trials can provide information on strain-specific effects and HIV-protective immune responses, and their analysis has identified an area on the HIV envelope that will be a focus of future vaccine studies. This comes at a time of steady progress in HIV vaccine research 7  and buoys up the hope that an HIV vaccine is possible \u2014 and perhaps sooner than later.

Accordingly, the bird's axis is kept parallel to, and opposite to, the course of the smoke as indicated by its train from the funnel. \n               From  \n               Nature \n                10 October 1912 \n             Reprints and Permissions"},

After eight years these anemones are still in excellent health, having been in captivity for considerably more than half a century. In one respect I fear we did them an injustice, namely in attributing cannibalism to them, the error being probably due to the observation of the birth of young from a parent the tentacles of which were not fully expanded. Recently I chanced to notice a young Sagartia attached to a small piece of seaweed floating free in the aquarium. A slight agitation of the water was sufficient to bring the young anemone in contact with the tentacles of one of the patriarchs of its own species. They immediately closed round it and a small part of the disk became emarginate. The greater part, however, was not sensibly affected, and the mouth remained closed. In less than two minutes the folded-in tentacles uncurled and the young anemone was thrust away with some force ... Neither the young one nor the tentacles that held it were apparently affected in any way. \n               From  \n               Nature \n                15 August 1912 \n             Reprints and Permissions"},

Lunar resources will not only play an important part in the establishment of a lunar base by providing life support materials and vehicle fuels but will also be an important, and perhaps a limiting, factor in the logistics of interplanetary space exploration. Certainly, only the most cursory exploration of the solar system could be conducted using either existing or planned propulsion systems so long as the rocket vehicles must lift all their fuel from the surface of the Earth.

Suzuki. The calculation refers to the time taken for the present crust of the earth to solidify. A result is obtained on the supposition that the heat of fusion liberated by the solidification of the crust supplies the heat lost by radiation, and it is further assumed that the effect of the curvature of the earth's surface may be neglected. According to these hypotheses the calculated time varies between 30 and 300 million years, according to the kind of rock (gneiss, basalt, or granite) assumed in the calculations. The difficulty is, of course, our imperfect knowledge of the experimental data on which the conclusions are based.

The 'Pisto Laser', so called because of its double pistol-grip triggering, was designed and developed by the Company's associate in the United States of America, the Kollsman Instrument Corporation. It emits a beam of intense, coherent red light of wavelength 6929 \u00c5., with a beam divergence of less than 0.3 degree ... The radiation output of the pulsed, ruby, laser beam is more than 10 9  times the corresponding output of the Sun within the same frequency band ... In communications research the 'Pisto Laser' can be used to study the characteristics of very narrow beam-width transmission of optical data; in medical research, high-intensity cauterization; in crystallography, crystal structures using non-linear light transmission; in photography, pictures of extreme clarity; and in biology, biological responses to high-intensity monochromatic stimulation. \n               From  \n               Nature \n                11 August 1962 \n             \n               100 Years Ago \n             A good deal has been recently heard about \u201choles in the air\u201d in connection with sudden collapses of flying machines.

In many parts of the world an immediate problem is a means of conveying foods from one place to another. For example, fruit, the sale of which provides a livelihood for some people, may be rotting on the trees because there are no roads on which it can be transported to other people who might benefit by addition of fruit to their diet ...

Shaw"}], "parsed_as_year": "2006_or_before", "body": "Elucidation of a signalling pathway that promotes tumour-cell survival during metabolic stress reveals that a protein called AMPK may both hinder and enhance cancer progression.  See Letter    p.661 Tumour cells face various metabolic stresses as they arise and progress. Early-stage tumours that have not yet recruited new blood vessels to supply them with nutrients will be short of both glucose and oxygen 1 , and some cells face metabolic stress when they make the transition from a normal to a cancerous state and become detached from the extracellular matrix, their normal environment 2 . Additionally, some mutations that trigger tumour formation accelerate certain cellular metabolic programs and thereby cause stress. A protein called AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a central sensor of cellular metabolism. It is activated during situations of metabolic stress that lower the intracellular levels of ATP, a crucial energy-supplying molecule 3 . On  page 661  of this issue, Jeon  et al . report 4  a mechanism by which AMPK dictates tumour-cell survival, and the surprising implication that it may have a cancer-promoting role in some contexts. The protein that phosphorylates and activates AMPK under conditions of metabolic stress is encoded by a gene called  LKB1 , which is classed as a tumour suppressor: mutations that inactivate this gene are among the most common causes of human lung cancer. However, the LKB1 protein phosphorylates 12 kinase proteins in addition to AMPK, and it is not clear whether LKB1's tumour-suppressor function lies in its ability to activate AMPK, some of these other kinases, or both. What is clear is that AMPK activation influences cellular signalling pathways that are involved in cancer, such as the mTOR and p53 pathways, and inhibits the proliferation of cells in culture 3 , 5 . LKB1-dependent activation of AMPK also acts as a general metabolic 'rheostat': under conditions of metabolic stress, this activation directs the reprogramming of many cellular metabolic processes 5 , 6 , 7  to restore energy homeostasis, which is essential for cell survival. But it is also not known which of AMPK's target proteins are most important for this activity. Jeon  et al . provide compelling evidence that AMPK exerts its effect on cell survival by regulating cellular levels of NADPH, a coenzyme that is essential for many biosynthetic reactions and which helps to remove dangerous reactive oxygen species (ROS) from cells ( Fig. 1 ). The researchers show that AMPK indirectly regulates NADPH by inhibiting the metabolic enzymes acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 (ACC1) and ACC2, the first substrates of AMPK to be discovered 8 . These enzymes control both fatty-acid synthesis, a process that consumes NADPH, and fatty-acid oxidation, which leads to NADPH regeneration. Jeon and colleagues also demonstrate that control of the ACC enzymes and NADPH by AMPK is required for the survival of glucose-deprived cells, as well as for that of cells detached from the extracellular matrix. These data fit nicely with the findings of a previous study 2  that demonstrated that the survival of detached mammary epithelial cells depends on NADPH and the neutralization of cellular ROS. The new results also agree with the finding 9  that the death of tumour cells during glucose deprivation is reduced by AMPK activation and fatty-acid oxidation. Although Jeon and colleagues have demonstrated a major role for NADPH in AMPK-dependent survival 4 , improved molecular tracing methods will be needed in future studies to determine quantitatively where in a cell NADPH is produced and consumed during the various forms of metabolic stress, and the extent to which production or consumption is influenced by ACC or AMPK. In addition to its role in conditions of low nutrient levels or cell detachment, as observed by Jeon  et al ., AMPK may be required to maintain metabolic homeostasis in situations of deregulated, 'revved-up' metabolism that occur 10  in response to the activity of oncogenes \u2014 genes that promote tumorigenesis. One oncogene implicated in many human cancers is  c-MYC , which encodes a transcription factor, MYC, that primes cells for proliferation by expanding their biosynthetic capacity and reprogramming their metabolism. A recent study 10  found that MYC-induced metabolic acceleration results in the activation of AMPK's function as a metabolic regulator and that AMPK and one of its related kinases (ARK5) are required for cell survival, but only under the conditions of elevated MYC levels. Another recent study 11  screened more than 200 metabolism-associated genes for effects on cell viability and found that a gene encoding a subunit of AMPK is one of only two genes for which decreased expression resulted in reduced survival of prostate-cancer cells, but had no effect on normal prostate cells. This selective death of cancer cells in response to reduced AMPK begs the question of whether the protein normally has a pro-tumorigenic effect or whether it more often acts to keep cancer at bay. AMPK is known to exert antiproliferative effects by suppressing many oncogenic signalling pathways and biosynthetic processes, and it is thought to be a major mediator of the tumour-suppressive effect of LKB1 (ref.  3 ). So how might these previously observed anticancer effects be reconciled with the idea that AMPK function permits survival of tumour cells? Is it possible that the timing or cell-type specificity of the loss of AMPK activity is pivotal in determining whether this event halts tumours or promotes their success by 'rewiring' growth and metabolic pathways to favour cell proliferation? This potential dual role for AMPK in tumours parallels the current view of the role of autophagy in cancer. Autophagy is a process by which cells break down and recycle their own components, and is one of the metabolic systems regulated by AMPK. In some cases, inhibition of autophagy promotes tumour initiation, but in many other contexts autophagy is needed to keep later-stage tumours alive, such that its inhibition might be expected to have an anticancer effect 12 . Indeed, Jeon  et al . demonstrate that reducing LKB1 or AMPK expression in a mouse model of breast cancer significantly inhibits the growth of mammary- tumour cells, and that the presence of modified versions of ACC1 and ACC2 that cannot be phosphorylated by AMPK also leads to reduced tumour growth. Such findings suggest that these effects result from inhibition of the survival-promoting pathways that stem from ACC1 and ACC2. However, the opposite effect has been observed when  LKB1  is knocked out as an early event, including in some mouse models in which cancer development is driven by the activation of Myc (ref.  13 ) or another oncogenic protein, Kras (ref.  14 ) \u2014 here, loss of LKB1 strongly accelerates tumour growth. How can these paradoxical results be resolved? It is possible that cultured tumour cells have a greater need for AMPK for survival than do tumours  in vivo  because nutrients in cell culture media are exhausted more rapidly than nutrients in an intact animal. Alternatively, the difference might arise from the timing of these events, and therefore depend on whether LKB1 or AMPK is inactivated in early- or late-stage tumours. This situation might explain previous data showing 15 , 16  that LKB1- and AMPK-deficient cells are unexpectedly resistant to artificial transformation from a normal to a cancerous state  in vitro , although this observation might also relate to altered metabolic demands in cell culture. Interestingly, another context in which AMPK activation seems to have both tumour-suppressing and tumour-promoting effects was recently reported 17  in melanoma cells expressing the oncogene  BRAF . Only time and a more thorough dissection of these possibilities in different cell types and mouse models will reveal what determines the part AMPK plays in different cancers. In the meantime, the prospect that AMPK inhibition might sensitize advanced tumour cells to chemotherapy, or even to their own deregulated metabolic demands, warrants further examination. AMPK may therefore be both friend and foe to cancer, depending on when and why it is needed. Correspondence to\n                 Reuben J. Shaw . Reprints and Permissions"},

One such event offers insight into the properties of both the black hole and the star. Astronomers have strong evidence that supermassive black holes, with masses between a million and a billion times that of the Sun, reside in the centre of most galaxies. The evidence comes from observations of the copious amount of radiation that is emitted when these objects pull gas from their immediate vicinity. However, if a black hole's close environment is poor in gas, gas accretion proceeds at a low rate and is not accompanied by significant emission of radiation. Probing such 'dormant' black holes is therefore difficult \u2014 unless a tidal-disruption event occurs. Such an event takes place when a star comes close enough to the black hole to be ripped apart by its tidal force. The ensuing stellar debris is accreted by the black hole and produces a characteristic flare. In a paper published on  Nature 's website today, Gezari  et al . 1  describe how detailed observations of a tidal-disruption event have allowed them to determine the properties of not only the black hole, but also the disrupted star Footnote  1 . Tidal-disruption events are rare. They are expected to occur once every 10,000 years per galaxy. To find them, it is therefore necessary to use large astronomical surveys in which thousands of galaxies are regularly observed. Gezari and colleagues' discovery comes from one such survey, which is expected to detect roughly one event every two years 2 . The main significance of this study probably lies in the accurate determination of the properties of the tidal-disruption event, which the authors based on a well-sampled ultraviolet\u2013optical light curve for the flare (a plot that shows the evolution of the flare's brightness over time) and spectroscopic measurements of the system. They find that the supermassive black hole is hosted by a galaxy at redshift 0.17 (corresponding to a distance of approximately 2 billion light years from Earth), and has a mass of about 3 million solar masses. Moreover, on the basis of the shape of the light curve 3  and the absence of hydrogen lines in the spectra of the stellar debris, Gezari  et al . conclude that the disrupted star was the helium-rich core of a red giant whose hydrogen outer shell had been previously stripped off, possibly by the same tidal force that eventually led to its complete disruption ( Fig. 1 ). Gezari and colleagues' observations also imply that the orbit of the star around the black hole was exceptionally tight, with the point of closest approach being only six times the black hole's Schwarzschild radius, which, for a non-rotating black hole, corresponds to its event horizon \u2014 the boundary beyond which nothing, not even light, can escape. After the point of closest approach, part of the debris was expelled from the system and part was launched into highly eccentric orbits, falling onto the black hole after approximately two months from closest approach, and producing the observed ultraviolet\u2013optical flare. During the past year, two other tidal-disruption events caused by supermassive black holes have been detected 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 . In those cases, the emission occurred over a wide range of the electromagnetic spectrum, from X-rays to radio waves, because it was produced by a high-energy jet of particles that happened to point almost exactly in our line of sight; such jets are expected to be associated with tidal-disruption events. By contrast, the ultraviolet\u2013optical radiation of tidal-disruption events is usually associated with thermal emission from an accretion disk of stellar debris that forms around the black hole. However, somewhat surprisingly, in the present case Gezari and colleagues find that the ultraviolet\u2013optical emission does not seem to be caused by an accretion disk, because its emission would have fallen off with time 8  at a different rate from that observed. This finding will provide food for thought for subsequent investigations of these events. Finally, the observation that the star's closest approach to the black hole corresponds to a distance of only six times the Schwarzschild radius suggests that effects of the general theory of relativity might need to be invoked to describe the system. Would the shape of the light curve be modified by such effects? Current models, including those used by Gezari  et al ., are generally based on Newtonian dynamics, and hence do not include the effects of general relativity. As a result, the models cannot distinguish between a rotating and a non-rotating black hole. Tidal-disruption events can probe deeply into the gravitational field of the black hole, and so offer the means to test the effects of general relativity and black-hole rotation. The fact that we are now in a position to characterize the light curve and spectra of such events so accurately, and that the rate of discovery seems to be in line with expectations, means that we should soon be able to answer these fascinating questions.

A. C. AITKEN, in a pamphlet entitled  The Case Against Decimalisation , presents very skilfully the case against decimalization in general, starting with a lucid and cogent historical review ... He is less persuasive, however, in arguing for the duodecimal system, adoption of which in coinage, with a pound of twelve shillings, he suggests. He claims that this is a much more efficient system than the decimal system and that its adoption offers substantial advantages on practical as well as on arithmetical grounds. \n               From  \n               Nature \n                12 May 1962 \n             \n               100 Years Ago \n             One of the chief objections to the Daylight Saving Bill is the dislocation the scheme would effect in the zone system of time reckoning established by international conferences held successively in Rome and Washington thirty years ago. Mr. W. Ellis, F.R.S., refers particularly to this point in a short article in the March number of  The Horological Journal . At present the prime meridian of Greenwich regulates the time of the civilized world. If the clocks of Great Britain are put forward one hour in summer, as proposed by the Bill, they will not show Greenwich time, but mid-European time; that is to say, our prime meridian, accepted by nations as regulating the time of the world, will be discarded by us for five months in every year ... An Act to enforce the alteration of clocks by putting them forward for one hour in the summer would introduce confusion in a scientific system and disturb accepted international standards. We cannot believe that such a proposal will ever be seriously entertained by Parliament. \n               From  \n               Nature \n                9 May 1912 \n             Reprints and Permissions"},

The former is much more widely distributed than the latter, and must have been the first metal to be known in many regions. It is, however, one of the most worthless metals for practical purposes, so that until the rise of Greek and Roman civilisation but little use was made of it. Copper, too, we only find in use to a very limited extent, as it was not well suited for the construction of weapons or useful implements. On the other hand, its alloy with tin afforded a metal which in many physical properties could only be surpassed by iron or steel. According to the views of several ancient writers, Lucretius and Poseidonius, so momentous a discovery as that of metals contained in ores must needs have been brought about by no uncommon cause. According to them, a conflagration consumed forests which covered the outcrop of metalliferous veins, reducing the metals and bringing them to the notice of man, but there are no grounds for such inference. \n               From  \n               Nature \n                28 March 1912 \n             Reprints and Permissions"},

The point which is at the moment attracting most of the public attention is that of the erroneous messages, or alleged messages, which appeared in the newspapers in the day or two following the disaster ... All this raises more prominently than ever the chaotic condition of wireless telegraphy in the United States ... [T]he most urgent call for help will pass unheeded if none of the operators on the ships within hail are on duty. In fact, it seems to have been a mere chance that the  Carpathia  operator was at his apparatus at the time the  Titanic  called. On ships that carry only one operator \u2014 and very few carry more \u2014 the man cannot always be on the look-out ... Engineering aspects of the disaster are discussed in the leading article in  Engineering  for April 19 ... [S]everal questions present themselves as ripe for discussion and settlement. The effect of centre-line or longitudinal wing bulkheads is one of these. Such have advantages in confining any water admitted to a part of the width, but have disadvantages even from the point of view of stability under disastrous conditions. The effect of impact on the superstructure of very large ships will have to be considered. In such ships it has become a practice to have two or three decks above the moulded structure. Would inertia have effects somewhat similar to those experienced in railway collisions, in which the body of the carriage is driven from the under-frame? ...

The main recommendations of [their] report may be summarised. First, it is recognised that \u201cthe stability and seaworthy qualities of the vessel itself\u201d must be regarded as of primary importance. This includes the question of watertight subdivision, now under investigation by a special committee. Second, as regards boats and life-saving appliances it is recommended that accommodation should be provided for the  total number  of persons which each  foreign-going  passenger steamship is licensed to carry ...

It must have evolutionary roots somewhere, but where? On  page 289  of this issue, Pani  et al . point the way with their finding that acorn worms have gene-expression signatures very similar to those that direct vertebrate brain development (A. M. Pani  et al .  Nature   483 , 289\u2013294; 2012). The closest relatives of vertebrates are the urochordates (tunicates, or sea squirts) and cephalochordates (the superficially fish-like lancelet). More distant on the evolutionary tree lie the hemichordates, which include acorn worms such as  Saccoglossus kowalevskii  (pictured), and the echinoderms (including starfish and sea urchins). Together, these groups comprise the deuterostomes, among which the elaborate structural and genomic innovations of vertebrates stand out rather like a cuckoo chick in a nest of willow warblers. One such feature is the signalling centres \u2014 physical regions of a developing embryo in which a specific set of secreted proteins drives the formation of a particular body section. These centres are present in the vertebrate neuroectoderm, an embryonic tissue that gives rise to the brain and nervous system. They are modified or completely absent in tunicates and lancelets, suggesting that many aspects of brain development are unique to vertebrates and arose  de novo  in the vertebrate lineage. Pani and colleagues' data contradict this theory. They show that a gene-expression program similar to that in three vertebrate neuroectodermal signalling centres is also present in  S. kowalevskii . Although acorn worms do not have anything like a brain, Pani  et al . show that these genetic programs are used to pattern (direct the development of) the ectoderm of the embryonic animal. The genes expressed are equivalent to those found in vertebrates, and they are deployed at similar times and places in vertebrate and acorn-worm embryos. The researchers propose that these signalling centres were part of an ancient gene-regulation 'scaffold' that was present in the common ancestor of all deuterostomes, and that was retained in hemichordates and vertebrates but lost in the evolutionary branches that formed lancelets and urochordates. Such an idea implies that the common ancestor was unexpectedly complicated. This does not mean that it had a complex brain, but that the genetic programs that were eventually modified for use in patterning the vertebrate brain already existed in an ancestral creature that lived perhaps more than 600 million years ago.

On  page 510  of this issue, Duprat  et al . formulate rules to describe how mists of droplets interact with flexible fibre arrays (C. Duprat, S. Proti\u00e8re, A. Y. Beebe & H. A. Stone  Nature   482 , 510\u2013513; 2012). The researchers began with the simplest possible model: the interactions of water droplets with a pair of closely aligned, flexible glass fibres that were clamped at one end but free to bend at the other. They observed that a droplet deposited close to the clamped ends adopts one of three forms: it could remain as a tight, spherical bridge between the filaments, or, depending on the conditions, it could either partially or completely spread along the fibres, in the latter case causing them to coalesce. On further investigation, Duprat  et al . found that six physical parameters control droplet shape and spreading; they include fibre geometry, the distance between the fibres, and the fibres' mechanical properties. The authors also identified a critical droplet volume above which fibres do not coalesce, and a second critical volume at which droplet capture by fibres is maximized. The team went on to explore the wetting of a natural fibre array by spraying a goose feather with oil droplets and observing the effects on the barbules (filaments projecting from each barb of a feather). They found that their theoretical model held up \u2014 small droplets spread along the barbules and caused barbule clumping, whereas larger droplets did not spread and could be easily dislodged \u2014 despite the roughness of the feather's barbules and the chemical affinity between the droplet and the barbules' surfaces. Duprat and colleagues' discoveries suggest that the mechanical properties and spatial organization of biological fibre arrays may have evolved to optimize interactions with liquid droplets, and so enhance functions such as adhesion, dew collection and self-cleaning. The work also offers opportunities for improving the performance of technological wetting systems \u2014 for example, droplet volumes in sprays could be engineered to fine-tune their wetting interactions with relevant fibres.

By Franz Boas \u2014 There is a popular fallacy that racial antipathy is based on physiological foundations. But in so far as such antipathy is real, there is nothing physiological in its causation ... The author's discussion and explanation of the causes and results of variation within a race ... supply the most convincing theory that has yet appeared ... The ordinary view of the mental deficiencies of the \"inferior races\" is remorselessly criticised. The lowest savage  does  possess self-control. He is not improvident, but rather optimistic. He  can  concentrate his mind. He possesses originality. Savages who do not count beyond three or ten easily adapt their language and intellect to civilised methods of reckoning ... The point is that these civilised methods are not needed in the primitive state, where each man on a war-expedition is known by name, though the number of the troop may not be reckoned. Both in mind and in body there is little to choose between the ordinary barbarian and the civilised man. \n               From  \n               Nature \n                18 April 1912 \n             Reprints and Permissions"},

Starting upon my journey about 10 p.m., it began to rain soon after I left the house in Bayswater, and I opened an umbrella, which, to my surprise, became stiffer and heavier every moment, and was found on examination to be so thickly glazed over with ice that it was impossible to close it. At the same time the pavements and roadway were also becoming uniformly glazed; pedestrian movement was most difficult, and all horse traffic was suspended. Although an experience of some forty-five years ago, the impression left upon my memory is still vivid \u2014 the ludicrous sight of people carrying ponderous and rigidly frozen umbrellas which they could not close, the stream of skaters down Oxford Street and Holborn, and the silence due to the absence of vehicles, all came to mind on reading Mr. Harding's letter. \n               From  \n               Nature \n                1 February 1912 \n             Reprints and Permissions"},

Of the data available for the investigation of this problem, the most satisfactory are derived from the annual volumes of Prussian statistics ... Thirty rural districts in Prussia were taken, and all the children in them born in the year 1881 were considered. It was ascertained for each district how many of these children died in the first two years of life and how many in the next eight ... If the infantile mortality tends to weed out the weaker children, then in those districts in which the mortality among the children born in 1881 was highest in the years 1881 and 1882 it should tend to be lowest in the years 1883\u201390, since stronger children less likely to succumb to the ailments of childhood would have survived their first two years ...

Western geologists who wish to make sure of receiving a copy should place an order, in advance of publication, with their national agents for Russian books. \n               From  \n               Nature \n                20 January 1962 \n             \n               100 Years Ago \n             The possibility of the discovery of a remedy for cancer has been advanced a stage by the preparation by Prof. Wassermann, of Berlin, of a substance which possesses a curative action experimentally on cancer of mice. Prof. Wassermann reasoned that since the cancer-cells are growing rapidly, their oxygen requirements would be different from, and greater than, those of the cells of the body generally. He sought for some substance which might interfere with the oxygen supply to the cancer-cells, and finally adopted selenium as a means to do this. The next problem was to convey selenium to the cancer-cells by means of the blood stream, and ... a compound of selenium with an anilin dye eosin was found to fulfil this condition ... After two or three injections of the substance into a mouse the subject of cancerous tumours, the tumours are found to have softened, and after six to eight doses they become cystic, diminish in size, and finally disappear, and no recurrence takes place. The eosin\u2013selenium compound is, however, poisonous, and a certain number of mice succumb under the treatment. \n               From  \n               Nature \n                18 January 1912 \n             Reprints and Permissions"},

This technique has outstanding resolution: it provides data in the sub-micrometre range, allowing analysis of structures as small as cellular regions. MIMS involves labelling living tissues with stable isotopes. The isolated sample surface is then bombarded with a beam of ions, and the ejected 'secondary' ions are measured with a mass spectrometer to determine the sample's molecular composition. The technique can distinguish between ions of very similar mass, providing a precise measurement of isotope labels, which can be imaged simultaneously.  Lechene and co-workers used MIMS to test the immortal-strand hypothesis, which proposes that asymmetrically dividing stem cells also segregate their DNA asymmetrically. That is, the daughter cells that will remain stem cells retain the older DNA template, whereas those that are committed to differentiation inherit newly synthesized DNA strands. The authors disprove this proposal, showing that DNA strands segregate randomly in proliferating crypt cells of the mouse small intestine (pictured). This finding should further our understanding of tissue homeostasis. The researchers also analysed protein turnover in the mechanosensory hair cells in the inner ear of frogs and mice. During most vertebrates' lifetime, hair cells are not replaced, but their degraded proteins are. One kind of structure within these cells is the stereocilia, each of which is made up of hundreds of filaments of the protein actin. Lechene and collaborators quantified actin turnover in both adult and neonatal hair cells and report that, with the exception of the filaments' tips, this protein's turnover is particularly slow throughout stereocilia. This observation differs from previous findings 3  that stereocilium actin has a rapid turnover time. According to Lechene and co-authors, this discrepancy may be due to differences in experimental conditions between the two studies. The team also demonstrates successful use of MIMS for human studies. They thus not only further prove the broad applicability of their technique, but also open the door to its use for investigations of metabolism and cell-lineage tracking in humans.
