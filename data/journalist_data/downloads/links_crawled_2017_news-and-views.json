The development could inform research into improved flu vaccines. At the turn of the twentieth century, the immunologist Paul Ehrlich put forward the idea of 'magic bullets', which could be used in the fight against human diseases. Seventy years later, this concept received support, thanks to technology that enabled the production of antibodies designed to target almost any antigen \u2014 molecular structures produced by cells and viruses. In 2016, five of the eight top-grossing prescription drugs were monoclonal antibodies (those that bind to only one site on an antigen), which target viruses, bacteria, toxins and proteins ( go.nature.com/2yidu1o ). Writing in  Science Translational Medicine , Shen  et al . 1  describe a monoclonal antibody that, in animals, potently cross-protects against all influenza B viruses tested. Such an antibody could protect humans against influenza B and could inform the design of broadly protective flu vaccines. Seasonal outbreaks of influenza A and B strains are estimated to be responsible for the death of up to 50,000 people in the United States each year (see  go.nature.com/2ao6jua ). This disease burden is likely to remain steady in the near future, because current commercial flu vaccines are suboptimal. The occasional emergence of pandemic strains of the influenza A virus adds an extra element of unpredictability. Typically, seasonal and pandemic influenza A viruses pose the greatest threat to the population \u2014 but influenza B can also be associated with high mortality, especially in infants and children. Flu viruses dock to host cells through a glycoprotein called haemagglutinin, which binds to host-cell receptors. Antibodies that bind to haemagglutinin to prevent this docking can therefore protect animals and humans infected with flu viruses. Theoretically, treatment with such antibodies could both prevent and treat flu by providing people with immediate, short-term protection (passive immune protection). Currently, circulating influenza B viruses belong to either the Victoria or the Yamagata lineage \u2014 the two split in the 1980s from an earlier precursor (see  go.nature.com/2hivvpf ). Antibodies that would protect against variants of both lineages are highly desirable. Three groups 2 , 3 , 4  have previously reported human monoclonal antibodies that bind to specific sites on B virus haemagglutinins to provide protection against multiple strains of B virus in mice. Shen  et al . have now built on these findings. The authors immunized mice with live influenza B viruses from both lineages to trigger antibody production by the animals' immune systems. They isolated hundreds of monoclonal antibodies produced from eight immunization regimens and analysed the ability of each antibody to block the attachment of influenza B viruses to cells (determined by measuring the level of haemagglutination \u2014 the clumping of red blood cells and viral particles bound together through haemagglutinin). The researchers selected the best antibody, dubbed 12G6, and combined the antigen-binding region of this antibody with the portion of a human IgG1 antibody, called the Fc region, that can bind to receptors on host immune cells to activate the human innate immune system. The group used the resulting chimaeric antibody, which they named C12G6, for all further studies. Shen  et al . demonstrated that C12G6 is a broadly protective antibody. C12G6 exhibited haemagglutination-inhibition activity against all 18 influenza B viruses that the researchers tested and showed higher potency than the previous cross-protecting antibodies 2 , 3 , 4 . Importantly, C12G6 protected mice and ferrets against influenza B viruses when administered preventively, as well as providing excellent therapeutic effects when administered after viral infection. Typically, an antibody that acts to inhibit the attachment of specific flu viruses to the host cell binds to a highly variable region on haemagglutinin's 'head' region. C12G6 is different, in that it binds to an evolutionarily conserved docking point on the head near the receptor-binding site. The group showed that binding of C12G6 to this site interferes with the attachment of all B virus strains (not only a specific variant) to host cells, providing an explanation for the antibody's broad activity ( Fig. 1a ). Next, Shen  et al . showed that C12G6 can inhibit influenza B virus replication by not only neutralizing the virus, but also activating the antiviral activities of the host's immune system through Fc-mediated mechanisms ( Fig. 1b ). In particular, C12G6 shows complement-dependent cytotoxicity, in which binding of the antibody's Fc region by immune-system proteins called complement factors triggers an extracellular signalling cascade that leads to the degradation of the virus. C12G6 also stimulates antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC), in which Fc receptors on immune cells are activated by antibody binding, triggering a direct immune response from the cell that again leads to virus destruction and elimination. The ability of C12G6 to both block haemagglutination of host cells by a virus and elicit ADCC is highly unusual. It has previously been reported 5 , 6  that haemagglutination-inhibiting antibodies block optimal activation of immune cells and so do not induce ADCC \u2014 more work is needed to explain this discrepancy. What is next to be discovered? First, it has not yet been proved that C12G6 is protective in humans. Second, even if it is effective, passive immunization against flu (especially influenza B) may be of limited value. Because of the short duration of protection and high cost of antibody therapeutics, this approach might not be as cost effective as seasonal vaccines. However, it could be useful for certain groups of people who are at risk of exposure, including health-care workers, emergency personnel and the military, because of the ability of broadly protective antibodies to be effective against multiple influenza variants. Finally, it will be valuable to find out whether the head of a B virus haemagglutinin can be developed for use as a vaccine. To be of use, the haemagglutinin head region used would need to induce the human immune system to produce high titres of antibodies that have properties similar to those of C12G6, and provide long-lasting and broad immune protection. If successful, such a vaccine could be transformative. \n               Footnote  1 \n             Correspondence to\n                 Peter Palese . \n                     https://doi.org/10.1038/516338a \n                   \n                     https://doi.org/10.1038/nature13054 \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

See Article    p.204  &  Letters    p.239 ,  p.244  &  p.249 How does the same DNA sequence, present in almost every cell in the body, give rise to diverse tissues that have distinct functions? The Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) Consortium aims to answer this question by using a strategy called expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) mapping. This technique allows the researchers to generate a comprehensive catalogue of associations between genetic variation and gene expression across many tissues in many individuals. In four papers 1 , 2 , 3 , 4  in this issue, the consortium presents the second phase of their project, and the largest survey of this type so far. Over the past two decades, considerable progress has been made towards understanding the molecular mechanisms that underlie the dynamic gene-regulatory programs that direct development, differentiation and function in specific cell types. The outstanding challenge is to understand, and ultimately to predict, how genetic differences between individuals contribute to specific traits, including susceptibility to disease. A large body of work 5  shows that genetic variants that drive inter-individual differences in complex traits, including disease, are often found in non-protein-coding regions of the genome that might determine how and when genes are expressed. As a result, biologists have set out to catalogue and understand how genetic variation in both coding and non-coding regions affects dynamic and tissue-specific gene-expression programs. The GTEx project, established in 2010, represents a coordinated attempt to achieve this goal. In 2015, the GTEx Consortium described a pilot study 6  in which gene-expression data from multiple tissues were collected from 237 recently deceased donors. The current iteration of the project involves substantially more samples \u2014 a total of 7,051 from 449 individuals ( Fig. 1 ). The consortium combined gene-expression measurements from 44 tissues with nucleotide information from each person taken from about 12.5 million DNA bases known to vary between individuals. This involved a concerted collaborative effort to overcome the ethical, legal and technical challenges associated with obtaining post-mortem samples on a large scale. In the first paper 1  ( page 204 ), the consortium took advantage of its large data set to show that the expression of almost all genes in the human genome is affected by genetic variation. Most of the variants that affect gene expression are located within a few kilobases of the affected gene, and are dubbed  cis -eQTLs. These variants are typically located in regions of genetic sequence that modify the regulation of only one of a person's two copies of the affected gene \u2014 for example in regulatory elements called promoters, enhancers and repressors. The consortium also identified several hundred  trans -eQTLs, which affect the expression of genes that are located farther away, or even on a different chromosome. These variants typically alter the regulation of both copies of a gene, for example because they encode transcription factors or small RNAs. The authors showed that  cis -eQTLs tend to alter gene expression in most tissues examined. By contrast,  trans -eQTLs generally seem to affect expression in just one or very few tissues. Many of the variants tested had previously been found to be associated with complex diseases and, interestingly, the consortium found that about half of these were associated with altered gene expression in some of the tissues that they tested. This observation demonstrates the usefulness of large eQTL studies for identifying genes and pathways affected by disease-associated genetic variation. In the second paper 2  ( page 239 ), the authors extended their analyses to specifically examine the effects of rare variants on gene expression. Every individual has tens of thousands of rare non-coding variants, which are often ignored in a clinical context and in disease studies. These variants are also not typically considered in eQTL analyses, which focus on common genetic variation. The authors present a statistical method that integrates DNA-sequence and gene-expression data from the same individual. Their findings underscore the importance of rare variation in determining gene expression. Their statistical approach could ultimately be used to predict which DNA variants in individual genomes cause cellular changes that lead to disease. In the third and fourth papers ( pages 244  and  249 , respectively), the consortium combined its GTEx data with other data sets to investigate how variants associated with altered gene expression can regulate two phenomena \u2014 RNA-editing processes 3  and X-chromosome inactivation 4 . In addition to the results presented, the GTEx project has provided a valuable resource for the community, making its raw data available in the dbGaP database ( www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gap ), and processed data available in an interactive website ( www.gtexportal.org ). The sample collection, quality control, data standardization and organization of the project are perhaps no longer cutting-edge, because the study was conducted over several years. Nonetheless, these aspects of the work are more thorough than is typical for large consortium projects, so the data can be readily interrogated by other researchers to address specific questions using more-nuanced analyses. As the GTEx project moves forward and examines more people, it will be necessary to consider three main challenges. First, although the consortium identified almost 1 million genetic variants associated with differences in gene expression, it could be that most don't directly cause gene-expression differences. DNA variants are often correlated across the genome, passed down together from one generation to the next. This means that, in addition to the causal variant for any given trait, numerous related, non-causal associations can be found. Therefore, some causal variants might not yet have been identified by the consortium. A complete genome sequence from each individual will be needed to identify all these associated variants, and should be used alongside new methods to predict the causal variant. The ability to manipulate genetic variants using CRISPR\u2013Cas9 genome editing and to analyse any subsequent changes in gene expression, as the authors do in a handful of cases, should also allow researchers to determine causal genetic variation. Second, although the GTEx analyses represent the most comprehensive tissue set catalogued so far, all tissues consist of many cell types, which probably contributes to the observed variation in gene expression. Testing for genetic effects on gene expression at a higher resolution in individual cells using single-cell processing technologies will help to distil the signal. Third, to move beyond descriptive work to an understanding of the actual mechanisms that underlie gene-regulatory programs, multiple functional genomic assays that profile factors affecting gene expression (for example, chromosome accessibility, transcription-factor binding and the modification of DNA by methyl groups) should be performed in the same cells. Genetic variants can affect aspects of the gene-regulatory cascade other than levels of RNA, and these should also be examined. The rate of gene transcription, the mechanism of RNA processing and the rate of translation are three such examples. Some of these aspects of gene regulation will be examined by the ongoing 'Enhancing GTEx' project, as outlined in a Commentary published in  Nature Genetics 7 . But for many of these dynamic experiments, frozen tissue samples, such as those used in the current study, might not be optimal. Future efforts could use stem-cell models, or study differentiated cells  in vitro  as a complement to generating data from frozen tissue. Nonetheless, the extensive catalogue generated by the GTEx Consortium takes us a step closer to decoding the regulatory code of the genome. The consequences of genetic variation on gene expression are gradually becoming clearer. \n               Footnote  1 \n             Correspondence to\n                 Michelle C.

For an adequate understanding of its causation, and of appropriate remedial action, we must therefore rely primarily on sociology, with the assistance of psychology ... The author makes it clear that most crime is confined to the younger age groups, is predominantly against property and not too serious, and is amenable to containment and reduction by effective community action. His prescription mainly emphasizes the desirability of a restructuring and fuller integration of the educational service in the widest sense, embracing the schools, youth service and the corrective institutions for the young. \n               From  \n               Nature \n                21 October 1967 \n             \n               100 Years Ago \n             I have never seen the following phenomenon described; perhaps a physiologist can give the explanation. If the eye is fixed on a stream of water for twenty or thirty seconds, and is then turned on to a fixed object, the part of the field of view that had previously been occupied by the stream appears to move in a contrary direction to that in which the water had been moving; the apparent motion slows down rapidly and ceases in from five to ten seconds. This is seen not only with lateral motion, but also with up-and-down motion, as when a stream is looked down on from a bridge. The phenomenon is perhaps best seen with running water, but it may be observed with other bodies in motion\u2014a passing train, for instance. The effect is very curious, as only part of the field of view appears to move. \n               From  \n               Nature \n                18 October 1917 \n             Reprints and Permissions"},

In the reducing atmosphere of primeval times direct synthesis of polypeptides would have been highly favoured as hydrogen cyanide was certainly a major component of the atmosphere. We suggest that after polymerization and modification in the presence of other reactive molecules such as hydrogen sulphide and acetylene, the prototypes of today's proteins were formed after the macromolecules settled into the cold oceans.

With the gradual exhaustion of the small number of top grade terrestrial deposits our mining techniques and metallurgy tend to become more and more adapted toward the exploration of lower grade and more extensive deposits. It may be that a considerable number of top grade deposits ... will be found on the surface of the Moon. Another potential economic advantage may be that the lunar deposits may, to some extent, compensate the terrestrial ones because of the different conditions which prevailed in the course of their genesis. From  Nature  9 September 1967 \n               100 Years Ago \n             During the total phase of the eclipse by the moon on July 4\u20135, 1917, it was remarked by several observers that the brightness of the disc was sensibly greater near the limb than towards the centre. It has been suggested ... that this appearance may possibly indicate a feeble luminosity of the surface of the moon. An experiment which appears to support this view is described by M. Nodon. A brass ball ... was placed in a dark box, of which only one side was open, and was viewed in a feeble light; the appearance observed was that of a disc brightest at the centre ... in the case of a sphere which was uniformly coated with a slightly phosphorescent substance, the luminosity was greater at the edges than at the centre. Phosphorescence of some of the materials composing the lunar surface is accordingly suggested as a possible explanation of the distribution of luminosity observed during the eclipse.

After an introductory historical account of the subject the author describes the constitution of the soil and the various factors of plant growth. In the development of these topics and of the question of the relation of the plant to its soil environment, the reader is kept constantly in touch with the best original work at home and abroad. The author ... has also added a chapter on the colloidal properties of the soil, in which he brings the reader abreast of the recent ... work on the interaction of dilute acids and soil colloids ... The study of the relationship between soil and plant is exceedingly complex ... It is a pity that so much labour should have been expended during past years in haphazard manurial trials, designed to instruct the farmer, but yielding generally a scanty harvest of accurate information.

The researchers examined the cause of mammal deaths at rainforest sites across eleven African countries over three decades (C. Hoffmann  et al .  Nature   548 , 82\u201386; 2017). Anthrax can kill wildlife, livestock and humans, and is known to be a particular problem in arid African ecosystems. In 2001, lethal anthrax cases were reported in wild chimpanzee ( Pan troglodytes verus ) populations in the rainforest of Ta\u00ef National Park in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire (F. H. Leendertz  et al .  Nature   430 , 451\u2013452; 2004). But the extent to which the disease affects rainforest inhabitants has been unclear. Between 1989 and 2014, Hoffmann and colleagues searched for signs of anthrax in the carcasses of a wide range of mammals, and monitored the distribution of the anthrax-causing bacterium in animal bones and carrion flies, a source of mammalian DNA. They found that anthrax caused 38% of the wildlife mortality observed over this period, and affected a broader range of mammals than in arid ecosystems, such as chimps, monkeys, mongooses and porcupines. The authors' modelling of chimp populations in the region (pictured: a chimp in Ta\u00ef National Park) suggests that anthrax will probably reduce the size of these populations, potentially resulting in their loss from this part of Africa, over the next 150 years. This is a risk that is only set to increase if chimp mortality from hunting and human-borne diseases continues to rise.

These chaffinches flew all round the tree in a most agitated manner, and one cock actually got on top of my head and pulled my hair vigorously, while a hen, which ... I think was the mate of my assailant, flew on to the nest and pecked at me every time I tried to touch it. Their attack induced me to get down; and not until I was more than fifty paces from the tree did the other chaffinches go away. Not very long after this I was in the garden when I saw two cuckoos which were flying very low, and I could clearly perceive that one of them was carrying an egg in its beak ...

Leaves produced in the aquatic phase are highly dissected, while terrestrially produced leaves are less dissected or simply trilobed. Bostrack and Millington have demonstrated that of the environmental variables to which the plants are normally exposed, changes in temperature produce the greatest changes in leaf morphology ... Large, readily quantifiable, differences in leaf morphology are observed with a relatively small change in an ecologically significant environmental variable ... [T]he relation between environmental change and morphological change is approximately linear over a wide range of temperatures ... These suggest a relatively simple relationship between a change in environment and morphological change. \n               From  \n               Nature \n                24 June 1967 \n             \n               100 Years Ago \n             On the afternoon of June 4 I was mowing a heavy crop of grass with the scythe when I noticed a sharp crack occurring during the cutting strokes. The noise did not occur at every stroke, but was sometimes heard three times during a stroke. The noise exactly resembled a high-tension discharge, and I can think of no explanation other than that the blade became charged, due to the friction on the very dry grass ... I may add that I am quite satisfied that the noise did not arise from the snapping of dry stems or from the scythe hitting stones, etc. I should be interested to hear if any of your readers have had a similar experience. \n               From  \n               Nature \n                21 June 1917 \n               Footnote  1 \n             Reprints and Permissions"},

Writing in  Nature Ecology & Evolution , Ottoni  et al . report their investigation of more than 200 cat remains and specimens, analysing a diverse range of material that included samples from 9,000-year-old bones, Egyptian cat mummies and modern African wildcats (C. Ottoni  et al .  Nature Ecol. Evol.   http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41559-017-0139 ; 2017). Their analysis indicates that the global spread of cats began in the Middle Eastern Neolithic (approximately 10,000 to 5,000 years ago). Dogs are thought to have been domesticated around 14,000 years ago (L. A. F. Frantz  et al .  Science   352 , 1228\u20131231; 2016). But, as befits their famed independence, cats lived alongside humans for thousands of years before becoming fully domesticated, and the authors note that early domesticated cats were probably bred as pest-control agents, not pets. The authors identified two major cat lineages that contributed to modern domestic cats. One of these lineages first appeared in southwest Asia, spreading into Europe by 4400  BC . The other lineage, which comes from African cats, occurred mainly in Egypt, and was present in DNA samples from Egyptian cat mummies. In Ancient Egypt, the cat was a respected creature, and Egyptians worshipped a deity represented by a cat (pictured: a statue of the goddess Bastet). The African cat lineage spread throughout the Mediterranean along trade routes (perhaps because cats were kept on ships to control vermin) during the first millennium  BC .

In addition, they maintain stable yields under a wide range of environmental conditions, including drought \u2014 a useful attribute in a changing climate. On  page 148 , Badouin  et al . report a reference genome for the domesticated sunflower  Helianthus annuus  L. (H. Badouin  et al .  Nature   546 , 148\u2013152; 2017). The genome of the sunflower (pictured) has proved difficult to assemble, because it is large (3.6 gigabase long) and highly repetitive. Badouin and colleagues overcame these hurdles using an approach that included single-molecule real-time sequencing of long stretches of DNA, enabling the many similar and related sequences to be pieced together. The authors compared the genome with those of related plants, to trace the sunflower's complex evolutionary history. They identified whole-genome duplication events that had occurred in sunflowers alone or also in several other Asterids \u2014 a family of flowering plants that, in addition to sunflowers, includes lettuce, artichoke and coffee. The researchers then resequenced, at lower coverage, 80 cultivated lines of sunflower, to characterize their genetic diversity and to help identify the genetic basis of agriculturally relevant traits. By carrying out genome-wide association analyses using additional lines, they identified 35 genomic regions associated with flowering time. Finally, Badouin  et al . characterized the gene-expression profiles of sunflower roots, stems, leaves and floral organs, and those of leaves and roots treated with hormones or exposed to stressors such as drought. They then integrated these data into models of the genetic networks that regulate flowering time, seed oil content and quality, which they constructed using information from related plants. The analysis identified both new and previously known candidate genes for each trait, and will be a useful resource for breeding programmes to improve sunflower resilience and oil production.

Lloyd-Smith"}], "parsed_as_year": "2006_or_before", "body": "Most human infectious diseases are initially transmitted from animals. An analysis of all known mammalian viruses improves our understanding of such cross-species spillover, with potential benefits for public health.  See Letter    p.646 In ancient Rome, priests divined the future by examining animal entrails. Today, scientists attempt to predict the emergence of human pandemics by surveying the pathogens carried by animals. Most infectious human diseases, including newly emerging ones, involve pathogens initially transmitted from other animals (these diseases are called zoonoses). Viral zoonoses, such as HIV, pandemic influenza and Ebola, are particularly concerning, given their track record of devastation. On  page 646 , Olival  et al . 1  provide the most comprehensive view yet of past, present and future virus-sharing between humans and other mammals. Efforts to understand the drivers of zoonotic risk have been dogged by concerns about biases arising from uneven research focus across species and regions, and by challenges in untangling alternative hypotheses. For instance, are we at greater risk of zoonoses from apes, which share our genes, or from rats, which share our cities? Influential studies 2 , 3 , 4  have addressed subsets of these issues or particular host types. Olival  et al . confront the full challenge head-on, amassing a database of more than 2,800 animal\u2013virus associations that span all known viruses of mammals and all major orders of terrestrial mammals. The authors used statistical models to attempt to assess all hypotheses at once, while controlling for uneven research efforts. Their work paints a far-reaching picture of the factors that govern how many viruses (total and zoonotic) are carried by mammalian hosts. Pleasingly, this broad canvas consolidates many earlier findings, often adding nuance. For instance, a host's relatedness to humans was known to affect its propensity to carry zoonotic viruses 2 , but the authors' analysis shows that the detectable effect arises almost entirely from varying patterns of virus carriage between primates. Bats, primates and rodents carry the highest proportions of zoonotic viruses, but only bats carry significantly more than other species after controlling for confounders, reinforcing an earlier finding 3 . An analysis of the viral traits linked to zoonotic potential (aimed at predicting whether a newly discovered virus can infect humans) confirmed that an ability to replicate in the cell cytoplasm increases such potential 5 . This analysis also solidified the intuitive idea that viral generalists, those capable of infecting a wide range of animals, are most likely to be able to infect humans. The study's most ambitious aim was to predict where and in which host species we might find 'missing' zoonoses \u2014 those that exist, but have not yet been detected. The authors extrapolated their models to predict the number of viruses that would be found per host species if all hosts were subject to elevated research efforts, then subtracted from this the number already known for each host (echoing a strategy used to predict future zoonotic diseases from rodents 4 ). This approach yielded enticing predictions of the species and regions that are most likely to harbour missing zoonoses, such as bats in northern South America and carnivores in East Africa. Although caveats apply, and the authors detected biases in their predictions for some regions, these findings could guide future investment in global virological surveys. Olival and colleagues must be commended for their robust, methodical approach to tackling this immense problem, the unruly complexity of which is arguably matched only by its value for public health. The authors have brought order to our understanding of virus sharing between humans and other mammals. But the potential of these findings to shape policy and research priorities demands a clear-eyed view of the challenges ahead. The study aimed to predict zoonotic spillover, but each word in this phrase bears careful examination. First, predict. The researchers considered total virus numbers per species, the proportion of viruses that are zoonotic per species and the zoonotic potential of each virus. For each of these outcomes, they produced models to explain observed patterns (taking into account various biological factors, as well as research effort), which can be pared down to models that predict outcomes for unstudied species (considering only biological factors, because research effort has no effect on true outcome). The authors are exemplary in stating the explanatory power of each model, including the lower power of predictive models. But none of the key outcomes can be predicted with better than 30% accuracy. We are therefore far from a predictive era in zoonotic disease epidemiology. As the authors state, their predictions are best used to prioritize research and viral-surveillance efforts, not to drive specific policy decisions. Second, zoonotic. Imagine dividing viruses into nested groups on the basis of their potential \u2014 realized or not, and observed or not \u2014 to infect humans ( Fig. 1 ). When we say zoonotic, which group do we mean? The authors' analysis of zoonotic potential addresses viruses that may never have encountered humans. Their missing zoonoses include viruses that have infected humans, or may imminently do so, but are not yet recognized. Meanwhile, existing data on zoonotic viruses cover only those known to have infected humans. How well can we project patterns from known zoonoses onto broader groups, given that host and viral traits can differ systematically between them? For instance, viruses that cause more-severe disease are more likely than others to be known, all else being equal. Olival and colleagues' predictions are, necessarily, based on current knowledge. They provide a benchmark against which future data can be compared to chart possible biases arising from projecting trends across these (perhaps dissimilar) groups. Finally, spillover. The paper addresses whether a given virus is zoonotic and so can spill over from animals to humans, but this is quite different from the quantitative risk of spillover. For example, Olival and colleagues' analysis would not distinguish between Lassa virus (which spills over tens of thousands of times annually 6 ) and Lujo virus (which has only ever spilt over once, to our knowledge 6 ). Systematic study of quantitative spillover risks will require approaches that integrate the relevant mechanisms, which occur at scales of molecules to landscapes 7 . Looking forward, Olival  et al . call for investment in viral surveillance, which would expand our knowledge of potential zoonoses \u2014 particularly if it involves epidemiological metadata and rigorous data-sharing. But although most pandemics are zoonoses, most zoonoses do not cause pandemics, so it is essential not to invest in broad, shallow surveys at the expense of understanding what determines pandemic potential. The crucial factor for a pandemic is human-to-human transmission, which is governed by viral traits 8  and population susceptibility 9  and mobility 10 . Gaining insights into transmissibility will require in-depth field and laboratory studies, combined with the development of quantitative methods to integrate the diverse data streams involved. In this endeavour, data-driven mechanistic models might end up being the new animal entrails.\n Footnote  1 Correspondence to\n                 James O.

See Letters    p.401 ,  p.406  &  p.411 The spread of Zika virus in Brazil and the rest of the Americas since 2015 has been deeply troubling. Previously thought of as mild, Zika has revealed a potent capacity to damage developing neurological tissues, with devastating consequences for the children of infected mothers 1 . Three related papers 2 , 3 , 4  provide much-needed insight into when, where and how the current Zika outbreak emerged and spread. This understanding was gained thanks to a mixture of high-tech molecular-biology and evolutionary techniques, and low-tech sample-collection efforts. The focus of two of the studies, by Faria  et al . 2  ( page 406 ) and Metsky  et al . 3  ( page 411 ), converges on South America. The groups sequenced Zika genomes from people and from  Aedes aegypti  mosquitoes, which carry the virus. Inspired by the success of real-time sequencing efforts during the Ebola virus outbreak 5 , Faria and colleagues obtained several samples using a mobile sequencing laboratory deployed in Brazil. Together, these efforts produced more than 100 new genomes. The groups used these genomes, along with some existing ones, to construct phylogenetic (evolutionary) trees of Zika in the Americas. In this way, they could reconstruct Zika's spread by following a trail of mutations \u2014 accumulated by virus strains that the authors sampled at different times and places \u2014 back to the outbreak's most recent common ancestor. These trees confirm previous evidence 6  that northeastern Brazil is the outbreak's hub. The Zika strain that founded the American outbreak was evidently introduced from the Pacific islands 6 , but the current studies cannot prove that transmission to Brazil was direct. Indeed, Faria  et al . note that some of the deepest branches and earliest samples on the American Zika tree are from the Caribbean. Nonetheless, the collected genomes show that Zika was circulating in northeastern Brazil by late 2013 or early 2014 \u2014 more than a year before the first reported case in Brazil 7 . They also demonstrate that northeastern Brazil was the source of onward dispersal to several other countries, with an estimated 6\u201312-month lag between dispersal and initial detection in those regions ( Fig. 1 ). These lag times are not unreasonable, given that it takes time for infection numbers to build up, and that the most obvious effects are seen in babies, born months after mothers have been infected. It would be a mistake to dismiss these findings because of the 'small' sample sizes involved. Sample numbers in phylogenetic analyses are not the same as sample sizes in, for example, clinical trials. A single sequence can prove the presence of a viral strain at an early time. And, as in the current work, just a handful of strains showing substantial genetic differences can provide compelling evidence for years of undetected circulation. Faria  et al . and Metsky  et al . thus provide time points from which to compare the pre- and post-Zika incidence of microcephaly \u2014 a condition in which newborns have abnormally small heads and brains \u2014 and other Zika-associated symptoms in each affected region. This comparison will allow a better understanding of the effects of the virus. The groups' work also indicates that successful jumps out of Brazil may coincide with times at which seasonal and environmental factors are optimal for viral spread by  A. aegypti . This last point resonates with Grubaugh and colleagues' paper 4  ( page 401 ). These authors set out to determine how and when local transmission of Zika arose in Florida, again using phylogenetic trees from human- and mosquito-derived Zika genomes. They found evidence that Zika was introduced into Florida at least four times, several months before its presence was detected. The virus probably entered from Caribbean countries linked to Miami by substantial air and cruise-ship travel. Miami may be unique among US cities in having the ingredients that favour Zika transmission: not only the presence of  A. aegypti , which is found in many US cities, but also large numbers of people arriving from high-incidence Zika areas at times when the mosquitoes are prevalent. Nonetheless, Grubaugh and colleagues provide evidence that each 'successful' introduction failed to sustain a permanent infection in Miami. The transmission rate was below the crucial threshold of at least one secondary infection per primary infection, on average (a secondary infection being one contracted from another person in Miami, either through a mosquito or directly). By contrast, Faria  et al . estimate that three secondary infections arose per primary infection in northeastern Brazil. These papers, along with a report this year on Ebola 8 , set a new standard for what can be achieved by studying disease outbreaks in tantalizingly close to real time, using rapidly obtained genome sequences analysed in a powerful computational framework 9 . Such work is possible mostly through the sustained efforts of a fairly small number of scientists supported by modest grants from a few enlightened funders. These breakthroughs not only are impressive in themselves, but also expose large gaps in current approaches to detecting and responding to potentially catastrophic disease outbreaks. Systematic pathogen surveillance is within our grasp, but is still undervalued and underfunded relative to the magnitude of the threat. A virus-as-wildfire metaphor comes to mind in this context (possibly because I used to be a forest firefighter). In fire-prone areas of North America, lightning is expected, storms are tracked and each strike is pinpointed. Planes fly out at first light to look for smoke near each strike point, and firefighters are on site the same morning. This mentality needs to be applied to emerging infectious diseases. The responses to the recent Ebola and Zika outbreaks undoubtedly involved great courage and ingenuity, but they have looked too much like valiant bucket brigades organized after the fire is out of control. We should be detecting such outbreaks within days or weeks through routine, massive, sequence-based approaches \u2014 not months or years later, when clinical symptoms have accumulated. To do this will require investment in more-comprehensive screening and archiving of animal and human biological samples (perhaps piggybacking on the millions of samples collected for other purposes worldwide each year, then discarded). It will involve developing better ways to recover and amplify viral genetic material from low-quality samples 3 , 10 , 11 . And it can build on the techniques deployed in the current studies. We will not put out every new fire, but we will catch some \u2014 and improve our ability to respond to the ones that get away. Any illusions that this approach would be prohibitively expensive must be dispelled by the certainty of future outbreaks that will have billion- or trillion-dollar price tags and cause unacceptable human suffering.

Roberts"}], "parsed_as_year": "2006_or_before", "body": "A bag that mimics the environment of the womb can support lambs born extremely prematurely for four weeks. This development points to ways to improve the prospects of extremely premature babies. Each year, about 15 million babies worldwide are born prematurely 1 , of whom about 9% are extremely premature, born after fewer than 30 weeks of gestation 2 . Research to develop an artificial womb in which to house extremely premature babies began in the 1960s, but no such device has yet been implemented 3 . Difficulties include contamination of the fluid in which babies must be submerged, which can cause infection, and pressure imbalances in the fetal blood vessels and heart caused by the device that provides oxygen, which can lead to heart failure. Writing in  Nature Communications ,  Partridge  et al . 4  report a step in the right direction \u2014 the development of a fluid-filled 'Biobag' into which they delivered lambs born at a stage equivalent to extremely premature human infants. The Biobag is a sealable polythene bag in which synthetic amniotic fluid containing antibiotics is circulated in a sterile environment, preventing infections (see Fig. 1 of the paper 4 ). The authors placed eight extremely premature lambs in Biobags immediately after birth, and connected blood vessels from the animals' umbilical cords to a specialized pumpless oxygenator device. Blood flow around the device is driven by the lamb's heart rather than by a pump, mimicking the rate of blood flow between the fetus and placenta  in utero , and so preventing pressure imbalances in the fetal heart and blood vessels. In addition, immediate incubation in a closed fluid environment prevents a cascade of changes that normally occur when the newborn takes its first breath, filling the lungs with air. These changes lead to re-routing of the circulation such that oxygenation occurs through the lungs, rather than from the placenta through the umbilical cord. Thus, the Biobag permits retention of the fetal circulation \u2014 no mean feat. Following birth, newborns no longer receive a continuous nutrient supply from the placenta, so the researchers provided nutrients intravenously. Some lambs also received insulin, which promotes fetal growth 5  and regulates blood glucose levels. These animals grew at a similar rate to controls that developed  in utero . Extremely premature human infants typically grow more poorly than they would  in utero , so this is an impressive result. Lambs were grown in Biobags for up to four weeks, and it is possible that longer incubation times would be feasible. Although such survival is an aim of neonatal intensive care units, survival without disability is the ultimate goal. Encouragingly, incubated lambs showed near-normal heart function. Oxygen delivery to the fetus and levels of the oxygen-carrying protein haemoglobin in red blood cells were normal at the beginning of incubation, but gradually diminished over time. However, this defect could be ameliorated by administering the hormone erythropoietin, which promotes the production of red blood cells. A newborn's lungs must produce a detergent-like substance called surfactant to reduce surface tension and prevent collapse during exhalation, which leads to respiratory distress syndrome. In extremely premature babies, medical intervention is typically required to ensure that the underdeveloped lungs secrete surfactant. Partridge and colleagues' immediate incubation allowed the lungs to continue to develop as if still  in utero . Post-mortem analysis revealed that the lungs continued normal structural development and began to produce surfactant. Moreover, lambs were readily transferred to a ventilator after delivery from the Biobag, as would be needed for extremely premature human infants, who may still require assistance to breathe after Biobag incubation. Normal lung development is a major achievement, because respiratory distress syndrome is life-threatening for premature infants and can result in lifelong chronic lung disease. Premature babies are also at risk of cognitive defects 6 . Partridge  et al . provide some reassurance that the growth and differentiation of key brain areas seemed to be normal. The authors found no evidence of brain injury, which is often seen in premature infants. Moreover, brain structure and function were normal in a single lamb assessed at six months old. However, these results should be interpreted with caution. The brains of lambs develop differently from those of humans, and lambs cannot be used to assess bleeding in the brain \u2014 a common problem in human premature infants that, when severe, can lead to neurological disabilities. Partridge and colleagues' results are promising, and suggest that the Biobag could soon be used as a tool in basic research for determining causal mechanisms of premature birth and for testing potential therapies for babies  in utero . This could be done in lambs and potentially in other species. However, many hurdles must be overcome before Biobags can be considered for human use. For instance, women at risk of premature labour are prescribed glucocorticoid hormones, which help the baby's lungs and other organs to mature in preparation for life outside the womb. The lambs were not exposed to prenatal glucocorticoids, and inducing early lung maturation might prevent successful incubation in a Biobag. Given that glucocorticoid therapy is well established and highly successful at preventing respiratory distress syndrome 7 , the idea of not using this treatment would be difficult to sell to doctors. Another caveat is that many extremely premature births are attributable to infections of the uterus, which are often undiagnosed 1 . These infections can have long-term consequences for infants. Biobag protocols would need to be tailored to match the needs of infected infants or of those born extremely prematurely for other reasons \u2014 for example, if the baby is induced because the mother has severely high blood pressure, a condition called pre-eclampsia. Although the Biobag can deliver oxygen and nutrients and remove waste, in its current form it does not replace other placental functions ( Fig. 1 ). These include the transfer of myriad placental hormones, growth factors and, importantly, maternal antibodies that provide protection from infections 8 . Future Biobag prototypes should incorporate these functions. A final consideration is whether parents would be happy to use Biobags. Current treatments for extremely premature infants involve placing babies in an incubator on a ventilator, which can be upsetting for highly stressed parents. One wonders how parents would react to the prospect of placing their baby in a water-filled plastic bag. Partridge  et al . suggest that the Biobag would be best suited to babies born from 23 to 25 weeks' gestation, who are at high risk of dying or surviving with a disability. The Biobag is clearly innovative \u2014 if successfully refined, it could show promise for use in large, well-resourced neonatal intensive care units.

These ideas stem from genetic evidence for the existence of extrachromosomal genes and the discovery that mitochondria and chloroplasts contain DNA and ribosomes and are capable of synthesizing proteins  in vitro  ... Although it is unlikely we shall ever be able to prove or disprove the hypothesis of the exogenous origin of these organelles, the fact that chloroplast and probably mitochondrial ribosomes differ from cytoplasmic ribosomes suggests that cells contain two independent protein synthesizing systems perhaps subject to different control mechanisms. \n               From  \n               Nature \n                6 May 1967 \n             \n               100 Years Ago \n             It is usually stated that the carat weight of jewellers and diamond merchants is derived from the hard seeds of the locust tree,  Ceratonia siliqua , which were anciently used as weights.

It would appear ... that the carat weight could be recovered with some approach to accuracy by weighing a number of seeds of the locust bean.

They then feed these patterns into a computer program that builds a 3D image (pictured). Holler  et al . create maps of ICs that have spatial resolutions down to 14.6 nanometres, allowing smaller features to be distinguished than with usual X-ray techniques. Their work will improve IC inspection, with applications from health care to aviation. \n               Footnote  1 \n             \n                     Imaging techniques: Nanoparticle atoms pinpointed \n                   \n                     Materials science: Improving the image of nanoparticles \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

On  page 373 , Hughes  et al . present an analysis of the extent and severity of these events (T. P. Hughes  et al .  Nature   543 , 373\u2013377; 2017). Corals become bleached when stresses such as high temperature kill the symbiotic algae that lend corals their striking colours (pictured: Great Barrier Reef coral with algae intact) and supply them with energy in the form of sugars. Prolonged bleaching can result in coral mortality. In 2016, a massive wave of bleaching struck the reef after an El Ni\u00f1o event brought abnormally warm waters to the region. Hughes  et al . mapped this bleaching across the entire length of the reef through the use of aerial surveys and underwater measurements. The authors found that the 2016 event was much greater in scope and severity than previous bleaching events in 1998 and 2002. In 1998, 45% of individual reefs surveyed escaped bleaching. This figure dropped to 42% in 2002 and to just 9% in 2016. Compared with the two earlier episodes, extreme bleaching events \u2014 in which more than 60% of corals in a given area lost their colour \u2014 were more than four times as frequent in 2016. Hughes  et al . show that the observed distribution of bleaching can be explained by the spatial patterns of ocean warming. Local management of fishing pressure and water quality provided little protection, suggesting that a curb in global warming will be needed to secure a viable future for the world's most spectacular reef system. \n               Footnote  1 \n             \n                     Conservation: Fishing for lessons on coral reefs \n                   Reprints and Permissions"},

The schematic illustration of the chain outline shown in the article gives only a small portion of the information which is expected shortly to emerge, but some interesting conclusions may already be drawn, particularly in connexion with predictions based on chemical evidence ... The appearance of the ribonuclease structure necessarily represents, among other more important consequences, a day of reckoning for those bold enough to have offered three-dimensional structures based only on indirect evidence. Such structures do not appear to have fared well ... At the present stage it therefore appears that the indirect approach to the construction of three-dimensional protein structures is of dubious value. The appearance of more complete structural data will ... now be awaited with the greatest interest. \n               From  \n               Nature \n                11 March 1967 \n             \n               100 Years Ago \n             The main thesis of the authors of this book is that much of the fatigue occurring among industrial workers is unnecessary, and is caused by the carrying out of the work under conditions which involve excessive and avoidable expenditure of energy. The methods suggested for the elimination of unnecessary fatigue consist for the most part of various mechanical devices. One of these consists in the provision of high chairs so that the workers can sit to their work instead of having to stand. Another suggestion is the use of chairs with springs which exclude vibration from the floors ... application of these methods produces a striking improvement. \n               From  \n               Nature \n                8 March 1917 \n             \n               Footnote  1 \n             Reprints and Permissions"},

It seems to have occurred in animals as a means of improving signalling to other individuals; to serve as a more efficient stimulator of more efficient patterns of action in others; to reduce intra-specific damage, and to serve as sexual or social bonding mechanisms ... During the evolution of vertebrates, ritualization has tended more towards the maintenance of efficient bonding and ceremonies have become more elaborate ... Particularly in the primates, ritualized behaviour resembles to some extent that of humans. \n               From  \n               Nature \n                21 January 1967 \n             \n               100 Years Ago \n             In the thirtieth annual report of the Bureau of American Ethnology, Mr. M.

Uncontrolled growth is the characteristic property that distinguishes all cancer cells from normal cells. Cancer cells are unable to regulate cell division and, since this characteristic is inherited, it is highly likely that it results from a genetic change. Before the discovery that DNA and RNA viruses can both transform normal cells into cancer cells, the hypothesis most frequently considered was that cancer is caused by the accumulation of somatic mutations leading to the loss of the function of some essential regulatory gene. With the discovery of cancer inducing or oncogenic viruses, an alternative hypothesis could be considered\u2014that cancer results from the acquisition of genetic information. ... it is equally possible that oncogenic viruses either cause a deletion of part of the cell genome or induce recessive mutations.

The introduction of editing components at fertilization aided repair efficiency.  See Article    p.413 The ability to selectively edit targeted genome regions using a technique known as CRISPR\u2013Cas editing has transformed many areas of biological research. These advances have raised the question of whether this technique will be used in the clinic in future to treat or prevent disease. Clinical trials using this technique to edit human cells are already under way, for example testing the use of edited immune cells to treat cancer 1 . There is ongoing debate about the potential use of CRISPR\u2013Cas to modify the human genome in an individual, a subject that raises many ethical and regulatory issues 2 . And if this were to occur, what extra scientific research would be necessary to reach the stage at which this approach could be implemented in the clinic? On  page 413 , Ma  et al . 3  report the use of CRISPR\u2013Cas editing to repair a gene alteration associated with heart disease, in a study of human embryos grown  in vitro . The authors thoroughly analyse the edited embryos, demonstrating that some technical hurdles often associated with using such genome-editing technology might be preventable. The condition known as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is an inherited cardiac disease. It can be caused by mutations in many different genes, including cardiac myosin-binding protein C ( MYBPC3 ). This gene encodes a protein that contributes to the structural maintenance of heart muscle and the regulation of its contraction and relaxation 4 . The presence of one mutant copy of  MYBPC3  causes symptoms that usually manifest as heart failure. Although existing treatments can lessen the symptoms, there is no way of tackling the underlying genetic cause in a patient 5 . Ma and colleagues investigated the use of gene editing to correct this mutation. One option to prevent some mutation-associated conditions from being inherited is to use genetic testing during  in vitro  fertilization (IVF) fertility treatment. This enables the selection of embryos for implantation that do not contain the specific mutation. If one of the parents participating in IVF treatment had a mutant copy of  MYBPC3 , 50% of the couple's fertilized embryos would inherit the condition. Ma and colleagues propose a hypothetical scenario in which their approach could enable an individual with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy to increase the percentage of embryos available for IVF implantation that would not inherit the disease. In the past few years, CRISPR\u2013Cas has been developed 6 , 7  to efficiently and precisely edit the human genome. Although this method has been widely adopted using mammalian cell-culture systems and animal embryo models, only three published studies 8 , 9 , 10  report the use of this technique in human embryos. The CRISPR\u2013Cas editing system needs just two components to modify DNA: a guide RNA sequence and a Cas nuclease enzyme, with Cas9 the most commonly used. The specific genomic target is determined by the guide RNA, which forms a complex with Cas9, enabling the enzyme to target a genomic site that contains a matching sequence. This is where Cas9 cleaves the DNA, causing a double-stranded break 6 , 7 . The formation of double-stranded breaks can activate one of the two main DNA-repair pathways in the cell: either the non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway or the homology-directed repair (HDR) pathway. The NHEJ pathway repairs a break by randomly adding or deleting nucleotides, which results in changes to the DNA sequence, making it unsuitable for gene-correction purposes. Therefore, approaches focus on HDR, which uses homologous (matching) sequences to repair the DNA breaks, making it possible to introduce specific sequences to enable tailored repair. Timed delivery of CRISPR components at an appropriate point in the cell's division cycle \u2014 either at the transition between the G1 and S phases or at the transition between G2 and M phases \u2014 might lead to preferential use of the HDR pathway 11 . Unfortunately, in previous reports, the efficiency of HDR repair after CRISPR\u2013Cas9 action has been undesirably low both in cultured human embryonic stem cells (around 2% efficiency) 11  and in the human embryo (14.3\u201325% efficiency) 8 . Ma and colleagues created CRISPR\u2013Cas9 gene-editing constructs to target  MYBPC3 , and verified and analysed the gene targeting using human stem cells. They then began to work with human embryos. One of the main challenges of using CRISPR\u2013Cas9 to edit human-embryo genomes has been the phenomenon of mosaicism, in which gene-editing inefficiencies result in a developing embryo that has both edited and unedited cells 8 , 9 , 10  ( Fig. 1a ). This might lead to a mixture of healthy and diseased cells in various tissues and organs, possibly causing disease symptoms. Ma  et al . investigated a situation in which the father had one mutant copy of  MYBPC3  and the mother had only wild-type copies of the gene. In control experiments, 47.4% (9 out of 19) of embryos fertilized  in vitro  did not inherit a mutant copy of  MYBPC3 , the proportion expected given that half of the sperm should have the wild-type copy of the gene. The authors demonstrated that, if genome-editing components were injected together with sperm into a human egg (oocyte) at a stage in the oocyte cell cycle known as metaphase II ( Fig. 1b ), then 72.4% of the resulting embryos (42 out of 58) had only the wild-type version of  MYBPC3 . The other 16 embryos had copies of  MYBPC3  with signs of NHEJ-mediated editing that targeted the mutant version of the gene but did not repair it to the wild-type version. Previous studies of CRISPR\u2013Cas editing in human embryos 8 , 9 , 10  added the gene-editing components after fertilization. The low levels of mosaicism (one of the 42 embryos with wild-type  MYBPC3  was a mosaic of cells that each had one of two versions of the wild-type gene) described by Ma  et al . might be a result of the gene editing happening before the first cell division occurred. The edited embryos developed similarly to the control embryos, with 50% reaching an early stage of development known as the blastocyst, in which the embryos contain different cell types. This indicates that editing does not block development. When injecting the editing components, the authors also included a nucleotide sequence containing wild-type  MYBPC3  that could be used as a repair template by the editing machinery. The authors designed the repair template to encode the same amino acids as the wild-type maternal copy of the gene, but used some different nucleotides so that they could distinguish between repair using either the maternal copy of  MYBPC3  or the introduced repair template. Interestingly, when the authors analysed the  MYBPC3  gene correction in the embryos, they found that only one of the 42 embryos that had wild-type  MYBPC3  had used the introduced template for repair. Their results indicate that the wild-type maternal copy of  MYBPC3  probably provided the repair template, rather than the introduced copy. This contrasts with the authors' observations in stem cells, in which the introduced nucleotide template was used for the repair process. The authors propose that the DNA-repair mechanism operating in an early embryo differs from that occurring in stem cells. In the embryo in which correction using the repair template could be detected, the template sequence was found in only a subset of cells, and the remaining cells in this embryo had probably been corrected using the maternal version of the gene. Another hurdle for the use of CRISPR\u2013Cas9 technology is the possibility of off-target edits that might arise if editing components bind to genomic regions that have high similarity to the sequence targeted by the RNA guide. Ma  et al . did not detect a type of genetic alteration associated with off-target edits in the wild-type copy of  MYBPC3 , suggesting high-fidelity editing. Potential off-target changes in other genes were evaluated. Strikingly, the off-target testing did not detect any mutations in the sequencing results from the embryonic cells, leading the authors to conclude that the targeting was accurate. This is an important finding because off-target edits have been described as a challenge for the use of CRISPR technology in the clinic. However, because the targeted gene sequences would vary, and variations would also be present in the sequences of each genome being edited, the risk of off-target events might vary for each individual case. The authors investigated a situation in which one copy of a gene needed to be targeted for editing, and found that genetic repair relied on the other wild-type copy of the gene. However, in some diseases, both maternal and paternal copies of a gene are mutant. In this situation, the wild-type copy is absent, so a repair strategy would have to rely on the use of an introduced template sequence. Inducing double-stranded breaks in both copies of the mutant genes might enable such a template to be used; however, it is conceivable that this might lead to increased usage of the deleterious NHEJ pathway. In such a situation, it is probable that specific strategies to prevent NHEJ, such as the use of blocking agents, would be crucial. That strategy would also be beneficial even when only one copy of a gene needs to be targeted, because 16 out of 58 of the embryos analysed by Ma and colleagues showed signs of NHEJ activity. However, there is a clear need to ensure that such strategies do not result in other damaging effects on a developing embryo and its genome. Although Ma and colleagues' demonstration that embryonic genome integrity is maintained after CRISPR\u2013Cas9 editing is promising, further studies and optimization of this technology will be needed. These will have to confirm that the approach is safe in terms of criteria such as mosaicism, off-target editing and the detection of abnormalities in edited embryos before it can be used as a therapy for inherited diseases. Nevertheless, this study is paving the way as part of investigations that might lead to CRISPR\u2013Cas9 reaching the clinic in the future. Until then, embryo genetic testing during IVF remains the standard way to prevent the transmission of inherited diseases in human embryos.
